Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more... Answer:","output":"A fitting title for this movie could be \\"Conan's Cruise: The Deadly Mirage\\". The title reflects key elements of the plot including the primary setting which is a cruise, the involvement of the famous Detective Conan, and the deception and dangerous circumstances that occur throughout the story. The word 'Mirage' is particularly apt as it represents the layer of illusion and confusion that covers the true culprit's identity and motives. The plot involves numerous twists, turns, and revelations, with the twisted perception of reality embodied in the concept of a 'Mirage'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The allegations followed leaked Twitter messages between Mr Bryson, Mr McKay and Sinn Féin member Thomas O'Hara. They exchanged messages before Mr Bryson testified to a Stormont inquiry, chaired by Mr McKay, into the National Asset Management Agency (Nama). Mr McKay said he accepted this was \\"inappropriate, ill-advised and wrong\\". The outgoing MLA for North Antrim also apologised for his actions. Sinn Féin chief whip Carál Ní Chuilín said Mr McKay had \\"accepted that he made an error of judgement\\" and had been suspended from the party. She added on Thursday night that her party would \\"welcome and co-operate fully with any inquiry\\". \\"Sinn Féin will co-operate fully with any inquiry and I am totally confident that any examination of the facts will confirm that Sinn Féin had absolutely no knowledge of, or involvement in, these events,\\" she added. Last September, Jamie Bryson used a Stormont finance committee hearing to make explosive claims about the multi-million pounds Nama property deal. His evidence included an allegation that the then First Minister Peter Robinson was set to profit from the sale. Now it has emerged that Mr Bryson was in contact with Daithí McKay and another Sinn Féin member about how exactly he should make his claims. The DUP believes the latest revelation shows there was a dirty tricks operation against Mr Robinson, who strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Now Mr McKay, once considered a party high-flyer, has submitted his resignation. The Stormont Finance Committee inquiry was set up last year due to political controversy over the multi-million pound sale of Nama's Northern Ireland property portfolio. It followed an allegation made in the Dáil (Irish parliament) that a politician or political party in Northern Ireland stood to profit from the loan sale. Last September, Mr Bryson used a meeting of the committee to name former DUP leader Peter Robinson as the individual he referred to as \\"Person A\\" in relation to the scandal. The then first minister of Northern Ireland strongly denied he had sought to benefit in any way from the multi-million pound property deal. It is now claimed that Sinn Féin's Mr McKay and Mr O'Hara advised Mr Bryson about his evidence before the hearing. Leaked social media messages obtained by the BBC's Nolan Show and The Irish News show that on 17 September 2015, Mr McKay sent a direct message to Mr Bryson, telling him to follow a Twitter account in the name of Thomas O'Hara, who is understood to be a fellow Sinn Féin member. The following day, a direct Twitter message from Mr O'Hara to Mr Bryson said: \\"You may only get 10-15 seconds on this before Daithi as chair has to pull you on it so squeeze your best points on this into 1-2 lines and come straight to the point.\\" Another message from him said: \\"Keep it short if you can, when it's said it's said and its privileged. Will be a great finisher.\\" In his resignation statement, Mr McKay said: \\"I want to be absolutely clear that my intention was not, as alleged,  to coach the witness in question with regard to the substance of his testimony, but rather ensure that the inquiry had full access to the truth with regard to all the issues relating to the Nama scandal.\\" Shortly before Mr McKay's resignation on Thursday, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness vehemently denied having any knowledge about the exchange. \\"Having spoken to all relevant personnel in the Assembly I am now entirely satisfied that Sinn Féin had no knowledge of any such contact.\\" But Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Mr McGuinness's statement \\"lacked the ring of truth\\" and was not the end of the matter. The Alliance Party's deputy leader Naomi Long said: \\"This is something that an independent person is going to have to look into to restore some sort of public confidence.\\" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the \\"seriousness\\" of the claims \\"cannot and must not be underplayed\\". Mr Bryson told the BBC that allegations he had been coached by Sinn Féin before giving evidence were \\"absolute nonsense\\". \\"I can categorically state that the source of my information did not come from Sinn Féin,\\" the blogger said. He also denied leaking the information to the media. Summary:","output":"Sinn Féin has suspended Daithi McKay, former member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for North Antrim, following allegations that he coached opposition activist and blogger Jamie Bryson before an appearance at a legislative committee.

He breached poll laws by flashing his party's symbol and making a political speech while voting was going on in the seventh phase of the election, it said. Mr Modi addressed journalists and supporters after casting his vote in his home state of Gujarat. He later posted a \\"selfie\\" of his inked finger on Twitter. By Sanjoy MajumderBBC News, Ahmedabad As Mr Modi's convoy arrived at the polling station, it was greeted with frenzied celebrations. His supporters had taken up positions all along the street - young, old, women and even young children among them. There were others on the roofs of surrounding buildings, competing for space with security personnel and snipers deployed to protect the man whom most Gujaratis want to see installed as India's next PM. Chants of \\"Modi, Modi\\" split the air as he emerged from the polling station only to be swallowed up by a sea of people. He waved to the crowds, flashing a victory sign as his security detail fought hard to keep his supporters at bay. After a short exchange with the waiting media, which included several international teams, he was off leaving behind a trail of dust. His supporters, though, lingered on. \\"He's winning handsomely, you mark my word,\\" one of them said. \\"And once he becomes PM, he'll be in the post until he dies.\\" India's general election, with 814 million eligible voters, is the world's biggest exercise in democracy and the governing Congress party is battling the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for power. Mr Modi is ahead in all the opinion polls. He was greeted by cheering crowds lining the streets and on rooftops as he arrived at the polling station in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's biggest city. Voting was held in all 26 seats in the state. Andhra Pradesh also voted on Wednesday for the last time as a united state before it is divided on 2 June. Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh were among seven states and two union territories where 139 million eligible voters had to make their choice between some 1,300 candidates contesting 89 seats on Wednesday. \\"The BJP will form a stable government in Delhi soon,\\" Mr Modi said after casting his vote. \\"The Congress party has already conceded defeat... It is the end of the mother-son government,\\" he added, in a reference to the Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul. By Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Modi's clever pitch in Gujarat But photographs of an upbeat Mr Modi holding a small white lotus flower, shown on television screens across India, have landed him in trouble with the Election Commission. The commission said it had seen the video recordings of Mr Modi's speech and that it was evident that it was \\"a political speech intended and calculated to influence and affect the result of elections in the constituencies voting today\\".  It has now ordered the authorities to register a case against him. A spokesperson for the BJP said Mr Modi had done nothing wrong and that the party would respond to the Election Commission notice. If found guilty, Mr Modi could be sent to jail for up to two years or asked to pay a fine, or both, but correspondents say it is unlikely to happen. Mr Modi is standing for election in two seats - in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi as well as Vadodara in Gujarat.  If he wins both seats, he will have to relinquish one. In Andhra Pradesh - where voting for state assemblies is also taking place - brisk polling was reported through the day.

The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps.

After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection.

The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  and the situation: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Answer the following question: Which would be a better day for group B to attack group A, battle day one or battle day two? A:","output":"Battle day two would be a better day for group B to attack group A. Let me provide a detailed explanation. On battle day one, the temperature in group A's territory is 5°C. This temperature is significantly lower than the preferred range of 20–30 °C for Acromyrmex heyeri ants. At this temperature, the ants may not be constructing more openings in the nest thatch for temperature regulation because the temperature is already quite low. In fact, they might be closing openings in the nest thatch to conserve heat and maintain the optimal internal nest conditions. On battle day two, the temperature in group A's territory is 22°C. This falls within the preferred range of 20–30 °C for Acromyrmex heyeri ants. In these conditions, the workers of group A will likely make more openings in their nest thatch in order to regulate the internal nest temperature as it goes up. This will make their nest more susceptible to attacks from group B. On battle day three, group A's territory had low air humidity. In this case, the worker ants would tend to close the openings in the nest thatch to reduce water loss for the colony. This makes the nest less vulnerable to an attack. On battle day four, group A's territory had high air humidity. In this scenario, the ants might not necessarily make more or fewer openings in their nest thatch, as humidity is not directly related to their temperature regulation strategy. Given this information, battle day two would be the optimal day for group B to attack group A, as it is during this time that they will likely have more openings in their nest thatch due to the temperature falling within the preferred range of 20–30 °C. This will make the nest of group A more exposed and vulnerable, providing a strategic advantage for group B."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Is this product review positive?

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how fire extinguisher works Suggested answer: Some jurisdictions require more frequent service for fire extinguishers. Should I validate this answer?","output":"The suggested answer doesn't adequately answer the question about how fire extinguishers work. Here's a more detailed and relevant answer: Fire extinguishers work by using a combination of suppressing agents to remove the essential elements of fire, typically referred to as the fire triangle. The fire triangle consists of heat, fuel, and oxygen. Removing any of these elements will extinguish the fire. There are different types of fire extinguishers designed to combat specific classes of fires: 1. Class A: These fires involve ordinary combustible materials like wood, paper, and cloth. Water or chemical foam extinguishers are commonly used to remove heat and cool down the burning materials. 2. Class B: These fires involve flammable liquids and gases like gasoline, oil, and propane. Carbon dioxide, dry chemical, and foam extinguishers are typically used to smother the fire, thus removing oxygen from the fire triangle. 3. Class C: These fires involve electrical equipment, such as electrical panels, wiring, and appliances. Non-conductive extinguishing agents like carbon dioxide, dry chemical, or halon-based agents are used so as not to harm the electrical equipment and to prevent re-ignition. 4. Class D: These fires involve flammable metals like magnesium, potassium, or sodium. A specialized extinguisher called a Class D extinguisher, which uses a dry powder agent, is used to smother and cool down the fire. 5. Class K: These fires typically involve cooking oils and greases found in commercial kitchen environments. Wet chemical extinguishers are designed to combat these types of fires by creating a foam-like barrier that cools and smothers the fire, preventing re-ignition. Regarding the maintenance of fire extinguishers, it is essential to perform regular inspections and servicing as required by local laws, regulations, and guidelines. These requirements may differ based on the jurisdiction, but a common recommendation is to have fire extinguishers inspected annually by a licensed professional and monthly visual inspections performed by a responsible person within the premises."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a \\"A).\\" movie review (Options are: A). negative B). positive).","output":"A). Negative Movie Review: Title: Disappointment Unleashed – A Wasted Opportunity As a movie enthusiast, I have witnessed countless films, both captivating and monotonous. This particular film caught my attention due to its star-studded cast, promising storyline, and hype generated in the media. With immense anticipation, I decided to give this movie a try. Unfortunately, I cannot express my dismay enough, as the film failed to deliver on all fronts. Ultimately, Disappointment Unleashed struck me as a wasted opportunity, one that left a bitter aftertaste, much to my chagrin. From the very beginning, the plot seemed convoluted and contradictory, with various subplots emerging out of nowhere, only to disappear without any coherent resolution. The film failed miserably in weaving these erratic storylines, leaving the viewers unsatisfied and perplexed. The characters within the movie were shallow, one-dimensional, and unimaginative, as though developed without any sincere effort. Each character's motive seemed irrational or outright incoherent, leading to the inherent hollowness in each interpersonal relationship portrayed in the film. As the movie progressed, the viewer’s indifference only intensified, as the characters' actions were neither empathetic nor comprehensible. As for the acting, despite a remarkable cast, their performances were well below par. It is unfortunate that a group of well-esteemed actors succumbed to delivering lackluster performances, likely due to poor direction and an uninspired script. The dialogue seemed forced with cringe-worthy deliveries that saw a more convincing inner battle on the viewer’s side, trying to restrain from rolling their eyes at every banal statement. Visually, the movie lacked finesse and refinement, resulting in its inability to create an aesthetically engaging experience. The editing felt clumsy, and the cinematography was underwhelming. Scenes that should have been gripping and intense were reduced to mere caricatures, further disengaging the audience. The soundtrack was unremarkable, to say the least. It is clear that not enough thought was put into selecting music that would complement the story or evoke specific emotions. Instead, viewers were left to bear the mediocre sounds, which neither enhanced the experience nor lingered in one's memory. While the promotional material led us to believe that this was going to be an unforgettable cinematic experience, Disappointment Unleashed fell painfully short. With a poorly executed plot, shallow characters, lackluster performances, and subpar production value, this movie is a colossal letdown. In conclusion, Disappointment Unleashed is an unfortunate example of a promising premise turned sour. With underwhelming acting, a convoluted plotline, and a general lack of artistic merit, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone. It is my hope that both the cast and crew take this as a learning experience and strive for better, more thoughtful projects in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.  Question: \\"What are some reasons for uses of the Albanian language?\\" Answer: \\"Protestant\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, this answer is not fully correct. It is true that the Protestant reforms played a role in the development of the Albanian language, but the answer should be broader and express multiple factors that contributed to the use of the Albanian language. A more accurate response could be: Some reasons for the uses of the Albanian language include its unique position within the Indo-European language family, cultural influences from Illyrian and Daco-Thracian roots, similarities with Balto-Slavic and Germanic languages, and the efforts to develop the language through church texts, publications, and liturgy in both Catholic and Orthodox regions.

These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Nina: Hmm, that's surprising to me, but I understand where you're coming from. I guess I was more captivated by the movie's visuals and sense of adventure. Eve: Yeah, I will give it that. The visuals were stunning, but I think, for me, it really needed a stronger storyline to back it up.

So, here's the continuation: It was easy to shoot the tree, but tough to shoot the target, because the tree didn't move or alter in any way. It was constant, a definite figure against the wide backdrop of the forest. The target, however, was a different matter. Unlike the tree, it was unpredictable, constantly changing its course. The wind played its part as well. At times, it seemed almost playful, tugging the target this way and that, adding to the already significant challenge. The air currents, changing with every heartbeat, were invisible obstacles that layered complexity onto the task. Moreover, to precisely hit the moving target, it wasn't just the physical challenge of tracking and accurately predicting its path, but it also required being mentally swift. It was a game of patience and concentration - waiting for the precise moment and then releasing the shot, hoping for it to hit the prey.

The most common sign of heart disease in a german shepherd is a cough. This usually occurs at night when the animal is resting.","output":"Treating heart disease in German Shepherds requires a combination of early detection, lifestyle changes, and veterinary care. Once you have identified the primary symptom, which is a cough, there are several steps to follow. 1. Consult with a veterinarian: The first thing you should do when you notice a persistent cough in your German Shepherd is to consult with a veterinarian. They will perform a thorough examination, including physical checkups, blood tests, and imaging studies to diagnose the type and severity of the heart disease. 2. Medication: Based on the diagnosis, your veterinarian may prescribe medications to manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. Common drugs used for treating heart disease in dogs include ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and positive inotropes. It is essential to follow the prescribed dosage and schedule to ensure the best outcome for your dog. 3. Weight management: Overweight dogs are at a higher risk of developing heart disease. Therefore, it is crucial to implement a weight management plan to maintain your German Shepherd's optimal weight. This may involve adjusting food portions, switching to a lower calorie diet, and minimizing treats. 4. Exercise and activity: While excessive exercise can aggravate the condition, a moderate and gradual exercise program is essential to maintain overall health. Daily walks, play sessions, and low-intensity activities can help regulate your dog's weight and prevent muscle wastage. 5. Diet and nutrition: Providing your German Shepherd with a well-balanced and nutritious diet is vital in managing heart disease. Talk to your veterinarian about specific dietary requirements based on your dog's condition and consider including cardiac-specific diets and supplements that provide essential nutrients for heart health. 6. Regular monitoring: Regular follow-up appointments with your veterinarian are essential in tracking your dog's progress and making necessary adjustments to their treatment plan. Monitoring vital signs and conducting periodic tests, such as chest X-rays and echocardiograms, will help your veterinarian determine the effectiveness of the treatment and modify it accordingly. 7. Manage stress and anxiety: Reducing stress and anxiety in your German Shepherd can help prevent complications related to heart disease. Provide them with a calm and comfortable environment, ensure they have a consistent daily routine, and use positive reinforcement training techniques to foster a sense of security and stability. 8. Alternative therapies: In some cases, alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, herbal remedies, and supplements, can be used alongside conventional treatment methods to alleviate symptoms and improve overall health. Consult with your veterinarian before incorporating any alternative treatments to ensure their safety and effectiveness for your dog. 9. Education and support: As a pet owner, it is essential to educate yourself about heart disease in dogs, prevention strategies, and treatment options. Joining a pet health community or seeking support from fellow German Shepherd owners can provide valuable insights and emotional support as you navigate this challenging journey with your furry companion. In conclusion, the most natural course of action upon recognizing the signs of heart disease in your German Shepherd is to consult a veterinarian, implement the recommended treatment plan, and make necessary lifestyle changes to support your dog's overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joe found out that his cholesterol levels were within normal parameters, while Manny had very high cholesterol levels and was recommended some lifestyle changes.  Which person had lower levels of HDL cholesterol?  Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine who had lower levels of HDL cholesterol between Manny and Joe. However, we can make some educated guesses and analyze their individual situations. We know that Joe's cholesterol levels are within normal parameters, which suggests that his levels of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) are not elevated. It is likely that his levels of HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) are within a healthy range as well, since a balance between good and bad cholesterol is important for optimal heart health. High levels of HDL cholesterol are typically associated with a lower risk of heart disease, as it helps to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream and prevents plaque buildup in the arteries. On the other hand, Manny has very high cholesterol levels, which means his LDL cholesterol is likely elevated. However, this information alone is not enough to determine Manny's HDL cholesterol levels. It is possible that Manny has high levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol, or he might have high LDL cholesterol levels and low HDL cholesterol levels. In general, a healthy lifestyle that includes a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, regular aerobic exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can contribute to better cholesterol levels. This includes lowering LDL cholesterol and increasing HDL cholesterol. Manny was recommended to make some lifestyle changes, which suggests that his current habits might not be fully conducive to heart health. By making these lifestyle changes, Manny can work towards improving his cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular health. In conclusion, without specific information about each individual's HDL cholesterol levels, we cannot definitively say who had lower levels. However, based on the information provided, we can surmise that Joe likely has a healthier balance of cholesterol levels, while Manny needs to work on making changes to improve his lipid profile."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The only strange thing about Carl the bartender is that he's not quite human. The humanoid robot mixes drinks for guests at the Robots Bar and Lounge in Ilmenau, eastern Germany.

With a glass in hand. humanoid robot bartender Carl is ready to serve customers at the Robots Bar and Lounge in Ilmenau, eastern Germany. Carl can mix drinks according to customers' requests and also indulge in small talk, his creator says. Carl helps out another bartender by pouring a shot of a spirit into their cocktail shaker ready to be mixed. The robot is the creation of mechatronics engineer Ben Schaefer, who has spent 23 years working in the field. He built Carl from the parts of disused industrial robots from the German firm KUKA. His newest employee helps out his human colleagues by pouring out measures of spirits and adding them to cocktail shakers for mixing. He can also conduct short conversations with the customers who take up the bar's nine seats, though they probably don't sparkle like the drinks because his speech recognition skills and ability to interact are, for the moment, limited. To make sure the robot does not crash in the small area behind the bar, Carl wears a belt with sensors. Carl's creator Ben Schaefer, a mechatronics engineer, has been working in the field of humanoid robots for 23 years. Mr Schaefer interacts with his newest employee as it offers up a glass of spirits to be adding to Mr Schaefer's own cup. There are only nine seats at the bar for the best view of Carl in action at the Robots Lounge and Bar in Ilmenau. The customers can have limited conversations with Carl who also measures out spirits for another bartender to mix. The belt helps Carl stay upright instead of spilling drinks everywhere and protects his human counterparts. Another room in the bar, described as a place to encounter technology and future visions, contains a life-size model of a Nasa astronaut. Writing on the bar's website, Mr Schaefer said his company aims to make humanity in humanoid robots closer to reality and show that 'scenes as in science fiction films are quite possible'. Humanoid robots tend to have limbs and a torso to resemble the human body, while artificial intelligence tries to replicate the way the mind works. Mr Schaefer said putting Carl to work meant it was easier to see how the design needed improving than trying to figure out problems in a laboratory. Perhaps one day Carl may boast the skills of Tom Cruise in Cocktail, but for now his creator is making him useful by having him measure out spirits. By putting Carl in a real-life scenario, it was easier to test the programming and make improvements than it would be in a laboratory. 'On this system, you can let your imagination run wild, because each step makes our robot a bit more human,' Mr Shaefer writes. For now, Carl will be part-tourist attraction and part test-dummy while Mr Schaefer and his team work out how to shake humanoid robotics out of its 'stagnant' state.

The 45-year-old from southern Sweden was found on Friday, February17, too weak to say more than a few words. He was found not far from the city of  Umea in the north of Sweden by snowmobilers who thought they had come across a ruined car until they dug their way to a window and saw movement inside. The man, who was lying in the back seat in a sleeping bag, said he had been in the car since December 19. \\"Just incredible that he's alive considering that he had no food, but also since it's been really cold for some time after Christmas.\\" a rescue team member told regional daily Vasterbottens- Kuriren, which broke the news. Ebbe Nyberg, duty officer at the Umea police, said police saw no reason to doubt that the man had been stuck in the car for a very long time. \\"We would not make up something like this. The rescue services were on site too and saw the same as us.\\" he told Vasterbottens-Kuriren. Umea University Hospital, where the man is recovering after being rescued by police and a rescue team, said in a statement he was doing well considering the circumstances.

Q:Given the background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.  and the situation: John is trying to figure out how the shape of an object affects how it reacts with other elements. For that, he chose two objects, both made of the same element - object A and object B. Object A has a larger surface area, but object B has smaller surface area. He let these objects to react with other reactants to see how the processes work.  Answer the following question: Which object would be more exposed to the reactants, object A or object B? A:","output":"Given the background information and the situation John is investigating, the object that would be more exposed to the reactants would be object A.  The reason for this is rooted in the basic understanding of how surface area affects the rate of a chemical reaction involving solids. When a solid substance participates in a chemical reaction, it interacts with other reactants primarily at its surface. This is due to the fact that the atoms or molecules on the surface are more accessible to the other reactants than those beneath the surface. Therefore, the more surface area a solid object has, the more of it is exposed to the reactants and is available to react. In John's experiment, object A has a larger surface area than object B. As a result, a greater proportion of object A's atoms or molecules are exposed to the reactants, allowing a higher number of simultaneous interactions to take place. This, in turn, increases the reaction rate for object A compared to object B.  To relate this scenario to the provided rust example, consider the difference in rust formation between a hammer and nails. Both objects are made of iron, but the nails have a greater surface area due to their shape and number. This increased surface area leads to a faster rate of rust formation (oxidation of iron) on the nails compared to the hammer, as more iron atoms are exposed to oxygen in the air. In conclusion, among the two objects in John's experiment, object A would be more exposed to the reactants due to its larger surface area. This increased exposure means that object A would likely react more quickly with the other reactants than object B, as the greater surface area provides more accessible points for molecular interactions to occur."},{"instruction":"Question: When I was home, I was comfortable.

Article: Jeremy Renner’s injuries suffered while filming the New Line comedy Tag won’t impact his shooting schedule on Disney/Marvel’s The Avengers: Infinity War. The actor showed up in a pair of arm braces to the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic this week to support his latest pic Wind River, which is playing there.      The two-time Oscar nominee fractured his right arm and left wrist in the on-set accident a couple of weeks ago; his shooting schedule had to be adjusted slightly, we hear, but production wasn’t impacted, helped by the fact that Tag is an ensemble pic. He stars alongside Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm and Annabelle Wallis in the movie based on a true story about a group of friends who have been playing a no-holds-barred version of the children’s game for the past 30 years. Warner Bros has set a June 29, 2018, release date.      Renner of course plays Hawkeye in the Marvel Universe of pics, the latest of which, Infinity War Part I, is in production at Pinewood in Atlanta. Renner had not started his part of shooting, and his injuries won’t impact any set schedule. The movie has a May 4 release date; Part II is set for May 3, 2019.      He also returns along with Tom Cruise and others for the next Mission: Impossible movie, which began production in April. That untitled pic has a July 27, 2018, release date. ||||| UPDATED: Jeremy Renner, who has been filming “Avengers: Infinity War” and recently started shooting the New Line comedy “Tag,” said Friday that he “broke his arms” during a stunt. The actor fractured his right elbow and his left wrist while filming “Tag.” “That’s how it goes,” Renner said. “It’s part of the job.”      The actor was speaking at a Karlovy Vary Film Festival press conference on Friday for Taylor Sheridan’s “Wind River,” but also discussed his role in Marvel films like “Avengers: Infinity War,” creating confusion that he sustained the injuries during “Infinity War” filming.      Smiling wryly, Renner said the injury wouldn’t affect his job. “I’m sort of a problem solver, you know. There will be an effect to it, but it won’t stop me from doing things that I need to be doing,” Renner said. “I’ll heal fast. I’m doing everything I can to heal faster.”      The actor, who has appeared in action films like “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” said: “I’m doing a job [‘Tag’] that isn’t really requiring a ton of stunts. It’s not an action movie; it’s a comedy. It just happens to have a few stunts in it. So I don’t have to beat a whole lot of people up or do anything crazy. So it won’t really affect my job. … It affects how I get dressed in the morning. I can’t tie my shoes, but outside of that and everything else, I can kind of get by.”      Related Jeremy Renner on His ‘Strange Tie’ to Sundance Crime Drama ‘Wind River’      Renner, who was Oscar-nominated for “The Town” and “The Hurt Locker,” says that he is sometimes “surprised” when he watches scenes from fantasy movies he has acted in, like Marvel’s “Captain America: Civil War,” because of the visual effects that have been added in post-production.      “Visual effects has become a huge part of filmmaking nowadays, and it is also done so well,” he said. “I remember watching the first ‘Avengers.’ … It was so big and there were so many characters and so many things going on, you can’t really understand from the script what the hell you are really doing. … Just figure out your character and your own piece in this puzzle.”      “And then the effects take over. Once we’re done with principal photography, it goes into editing and the effects are added, and [the VFX] create the bad guys, the aliens, the backdrop,” he added. “So it is always a surprise when it comes to films like ‘Avengers’ and the whole Marvel universe to see [the finished movie]. It’s the only time that I really watch a movie that I’ve done because it is a complete surprise to me how it has actually turned out.”      Correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously reported that Renner sustained the injuries while filming a stunt for “Avengers: Infinity War.” He was instead shooting the comedy “Tag.” |||||Summary:","output":"Jeremy Renner suffered injuries to his right arm and left wrist while filming the New Line comedy 'Tag,' but this will not impact his shooting schedule for Disney/Marvel's 'The Avengers: Infinity War.' The incident occurred a couple of weeks ago, and although Renner's shooting schedule had to be slightly adjusted, production was not impacted.

Ouch: Binge drinking costs more than just a hangover. The CDC says it costs more than 223.5billion a year. A shocking new government study claims that excessive drinking costs the nation more than 223.5billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime and early death - and most of the burden is carried by taxpayers. The research, released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control, finds that binge drinking, alcoholism and alcohol abuse is dragging millions - and sometimes billions - of dollars from the economies of every state in the country. The health and productivity losses mean that for every cocktail, pint of beer or glass of wine consumed, American society must pay nearly 2 in additional costs. The nation's capital, which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the country according to CDC figures, pays the most. Washington DC residents consumed more than 680 drinks each in 2006 - the year that the study surveyed. Those drinks cost out more than 966billion in ancillary healthcare bills and productivity losses as a result - more than 1,660 per resident of the city. Utah, where strong influence from the Mormon church means alcohol is heavily regulated, has the lowest rates of alcohol consumption and - as a result - the lowest costs. Utah residents consumed fewer than 200 drinks each in 2006 and paid just 578 per capita. The shocking figure of 223.5billion is larger than the economies of Ireland and Pakistan. Researchers say it should serve as a wake-up call that the country needs to curb its drinking habit. 'Excessive alcohol use has devastating impacts on individuals, families, communities, and the economy,' CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said in a statement. 'In addition to injury, illness, disease, and death, it costs our society billions of dollars through reduced work productivity, increased criminal justice expenses, and higher healthcare costs. 'Effective prevention programs can support people in making wise choices about drinking alcohol.' About 42 percent of the cost of heavy drinking was paid by state or federal funds - whether through Medicare and Medicaid or by  other government services. That amounted to the largest share of the cost - and less than the cost paid by heavy drinkers and their families. Some 70percent of the costs of excessive alcohol use was incurred by binge drinkers - those who consume five or more drinks in a single sitting. Binge drinkers account for an estimated 70percent of the cost of alcohol abuse in America, the CDC study found. Authors of the study cautioned that the data doesn't include drinkers whose productivity at work is hampered by hangovers. A MailOnline analysis of CDC data shows that New Hampshire had the highest rates of alcohol consumption, with 736 drinks purchased per capita in 2006. Washington, DC, and Nevada were the next highest. However, the CDC points out that in New Hampshire many of the package liquor buyers come from other states and in Nevada - home to Sin City - much of the state's alcohol consumption can be attributed to tourists. The lowest per capita alcohol consumption was in Utah, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The study will be published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.","output":"A new government study has revealed that excessive drinking costs the United States more than 223.5 billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime, and early death.

Bread was usually made from barley flour, while wheat was used for more expensive loaves. 2. Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, and beans were commonly consumed. 3. Vegetables: Onions, leeks, and garlic were essential flavorings, while cucumbers, melons, gourds, and leafy greens were also widely eaten. 4. Fruits: Figs, grapes, olives, and dates were typical fruits consumed. They could be eaten fresh or dried, and were often used to make juices and wines. 5. Dairy: Dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and milk, primarily from sheep and goats, were consumed by ancient Israelites. 6. Fish: Fish was a significant protein source, especially for populations living near water sources. 7. Meat: Although meat was considered a luxury and consumed less frequently, when available, it usually came from domestically raised animals like sheep, goats, and cattle. Poultry such as chicken and dove was also consumed. 8. Nuts and seeds: During the time of King David, people consumed almonds, walnuts, and sesame seeds as supplemental sources of fat and protein. 9. Olive oil: Olive oil was the primary type of oil used for cooking and in dressings. 10. Herbs and spices: Common herbs and spices included cumin, coriander, mint, dill, and mustard.

Answer based on context: 2001-2002 Rodriguezs power hitting numbers improved with his move to the Texas Rangers. In his first season there, Rodriguez produced one of the top offensive seasons ever for a shortstop, leading the American League with 52 HR, 133 runs scored, and 393 total bases. He became the first player since 1932 with 50 homers and 200 hits in a season, just the third shortstop to ever lead the league in homers, and was just the second AL player in the last 34 seasons (beginning 1968) to lead the league in runs, homers, and total bases; his total base figure is the most ever for a major league shortstop. His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing Ernie Banks record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B Mike Schmidts mark of 48 in 1980. It was his 5th 30-homer campaign, tying Banks for most ever by a shortstop. He also tied for the league lead in extra-base hits (87) and ranked third in RBIs (135) and slugging (.622). He was also among the AL leaders in hits (4th, 201), average (7th, .318), and on-base percentage (8th, .399). He established Rangers club records for homers, runs, total bases, and hit by pitches, had the 2nd most extra-base hits, and the fourth-highest RBI total. He led the club in runs, hits, doubles (34), homers, RBI, slugging, and on-base percentage and was second in walks (75), stolen bases (18), and game-winning RBI (14) while posting career highs for homers, RBI, and total bases. Rodriguez started 161 games at shortstop and one as the Designated hitter, the only major league player to start all of his teams games in 2001. Whose all records did Rodriguez break?","output":"In the given context, Alex Rodriguez broke the following records: 1. Ernie Banks' record for most home runs by a shortstop (Rodriguez hit 52, surpassing Banks' 47 in 1958). 2. Mike Schmidt's record for most home runs by an infielder other than a first baseman (Rodriguez hit 52, breaking Schmidt's mark of 48 as a third baseman in 1980).

From the outset, the application gave off a non-user-friendly vibe. I was under the impression that the interface was convoluted and too complex for someone just dipping their toes into this field. The layout was not intuitive, making navigation exceedingly laborious. Apps aimed at all users should ensure they cater to all skill levels, but this was certainly not the case here. Additionally, the application is riddled with technical flaws. It crashes more often than not, disrupting work and leading to a significant amount of data loss. Notably, despite repeated attempts, the app struggled to execute certain vital Linux commands correctly, which is an outright letdown given the app's primary purpose. The so-called 'customer support' was just as discouraging. I reached out for help several times due to the issues that I encountered, and either I received no response at all or it was delayed for such an extended period that it was nearly unhelpful. Lastly, regarding app updates, they are slow and scarce. Despite numerous negative feedback, the app seems to ignore the need for crucial bug fixes that could potentially improve the user experience dramatically. In conclusion, the BusyBox app by Meefik seems to have potential, but it fails to deliver on its promises right now.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia?  John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.","output":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia was Nobadia.

This game also allows you to use a few different options with X's armor which makes it a more custom experience. The overall game is a great example of where the X series should go in the future and for the price is worth the buy. Is this product review negative? The answer is:","output":"No, this product review is not negative.  It starts off expressing relief and satisfaction that a \\"good X game is back,\\" suggesting that the reviewer approves of the game and is pleased with the improvements made.

The reviewer describes the game as providing a \\"true X experience\\" that is enjoyable, even if it is considered somewhat easy. Although the reviewer states that the character switch option makes the game easier than they would prefer, it's not framed as a major downside to the game but rather a feature that lessens the game's difficulty level.  The reviewer also appreciates the customizable features for X's armor, indicating that they enjoy having options to personalize their gameplay experience. They commend the overall game as a \\"great example of where the Series X should go.\\" This recognizes that the game could serve as an important reference point for the series' future direction, implying that the reviewer sees potential in the future of the series. Lastly, the reviewer believes the game is worth its price. If the reviewer saw the game as generally negative or disappointing, they would likely suggest it isn't worth the cost. Therefore, these points all lead to the conclusion that this review is not negative, but instead, it's somewhat balanced with a leaning towards positive. Yes, there are criticisms, but the reviewer acknowledges positive aspects and improvements, expresses optimism about the future of the series, and deems the game a worthy purchase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A man jogging through suburban London grabs his heart, and collapses. He wakes up in a hospital bed. The nurse tending him give him water. She leaves. He pulls down the bed covers to discover both his legs have been amputated. He screams. An official (Marshall Jones) from an unidentified Eastern European totalitarian state arrives back at his home country. Upon being debriefed by a superior officer, the man steps around the table, places a hand on the man's shoulder, paralyzes him, and kills him. A Metropolitan London detective (Alfred Marks) and his unit, investigate the deaths of several young women in the city. The women, picked up at nightclubs by Keith (Michael Gothard), have apparently been killed by the same individual, and some of the bodies have been drained of blood. The centerpiece of the movie is a near 15 min. long police car-chase/foot-chase sequence through suburban London. Vincent Price plays a doctor whose clinic specializes in limb and organ transplantation. Christopher Lee plays the head of Britain's -unnamed- intelligence services.

Since their domestication, a large number of breeds of chickens have been established, but with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin. In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.

When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David (Terry Kinney) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her fatherâs old barn to incubate. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert (Jeremy Ratchford) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all domestic geese must have their wings pinioned (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them. Thomas decides to use an ultralight aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry (Holter Graham), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.     Thomas (Jeff Daniels) attempts to get the geese to follow him. Amy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amyâs aircraft and lands in an isolated forest.

Saya is introduced on a subway train, where she assassinates a man in a suit. Her American contacts or handlers arrive. One of them, David, begins to brief Saya on another mission, while the other, Louis, discovers that the man Saya has just killed was probably not a chiropteran.Saya's next mission begins at the American Yokota Air Base, which is active in the buildup to the Vietnam War. At least one chiropteran has managed to infiltrate the air base, and it is only a matter of time before they feed again, go into hibernation, and become untraceable. Saya is to pose as a school girl, infiltrate the high school adjacent to the base, and then track and kill the chiropterans.At the school, Saya runs into a meek nurse, Makiho Amano, on the eve of the school's annual Halloween party. Two of Saya's classmates, Sharon and Linda, make a visit to Makiho at the nurse's office. Suddenly, Saya bursts into the room, killing Linda and wounding Sharon, breaking her sword in the process. Both girls are revealed to be chiropterans. Makiho goes into shock at the revelation. Meanwhile, a third chiropteran reveals itself and begins making its way to the base. Back at the school, Makiho regains her nerve and pursues Sharon into a room full of dancing Americans in costume, where she finds Sharon transformed. Saya saves her and both flee into a nearby motor pool. The chiropterans trap them inside and attack.David delivers a new sword, and Saya uses it to kill Sharon. The final chiropteran then decides to flee, attempting to stow away on a departing cargo plane. David and Saya give chase and she manages to strike the chiropteran and mortally wound it. She then stands over the dying creature and lets some of her blood trickle into its mouth. Louis arrives and recovers Makiho before the local police reach her.Afterwards, Makiho is seen at an interview with government officials who question her about the night's events. However, it's revealed that all evidence of the battle between Saya and the chiropterans has been covered up and both David and Saya have disappeared, leaving Makiho with nothing to prove the veracity of her story. Her interviewer then asks her to identify Saya in a picture which has a girl that looks identical to her, except the picture was taken in 1892. The only other description of the picture is the word \\"VAMPIRE\\". Makiho then returns to the school, where she narrates that she never really discovered the full truth behind Saya and the chiropterans, and wonders if she's still out there fighting them., Question: who goes into shock at revelation?","output":"Makiho Amano goes into shock at the revelation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you're starting with dry hair, use a spray bottle to dampen your hair. If you decide to wash your hair, let it dry a bit before putting your hair in buns. To get big, messy Beyoncé waves, you need to give your hair some body. Whether you use a cream, gel, or spray, be sure to apply a light coat to all of your hair.  If your hair tends to get frizzy, apply a lightweight leave-in conditioner or oil as well. If you plan on blowdrying your hair, apply heat protectant to your hair. How much hair you have will determine how many buns you'll need. If you have thicker hair, you will most likely need 2-3 buns. If you have finer hair, you can get away with 1-2 buns. Hold each section in place with a hair tie until it is time to put it in a bun.  The way you divide your hair is completely up to you. For example, you can part your hair down the middle so that you have one bun on each side of your head, or you can  place the top half of your hair in one bun, and the bottom half of your hair in another bun. This method works best on longer hair styles. If you have shorter hair, you may need to add an extra bun or two to ensure that no pieces of hair are left out of a bun. Take the first section of your hair out of it's hair tie. Twirl your hair and twist it into a bun – think of tight Princess Leia buns, or the swirl of a cinnamon roll to give you an idea of what these buns should look like. Don't worry about the buns looking perfect, but make sure all of your hair is twisted tightly.  Secure the bun with a hair tie, a hair clip, or bobby pins. Make sure the ends of your hair are tucked into your bun. Repeat this process with each section of hair. Ideally, you should sleep in your buns overnight to set the waves into your hair. If you're able to sleep in your buns overnight, tie a scarf around your head to prevent your hair from frizzing. If you don't have all night to let your hair dry, it's time to blow dry those buns! To ensure your buns are thoroughly dried, blow dry each bun for at least 10 minutes. (Remember, if you plan on blowdrying your hair, use a heat protectant on your hair before you put it in buns). Unwrap each bun and gently loosen each twist with your fingers. Once you've taken all of your buns down, style your hair. If you like the messy waves, only use your fingers to comb through your hair. If you want a smoother look, brush your hair. Finish your Beyoncé look with hairspray. Summary:","output":"This article provides a method for creating big, messy Beyoncé waves in your hair.

Rebecca asked Mary to turn off her phone while in the theater, because  Possible answers: [i] Rebecca is being rude. [ii] Mary is being rude.","output":"Mary hesitated for a moment before reaching into her bag to find her phone. As the lights began to dim in the theater, Rebecca could sense the discomfort and annoyance building up amongst their fellow audience members due to Mary's glowing screen. Although she didn't want to assume the role of a scolding friend, Rebecca understood that it was essential to remind Mary of the importance of maintaining proper etiquette during a live performance. Rebecca was in no way trying to be rude when she asked Mary to turn off her phone. Instead, she was merely upholding the unwritten rules of theater etiquette, which demonstrate respect for the performers and fellow audience members alike. The primary reason behind this request was to prevent any disruptions, such as the noise and visual distraction caused by an active cell phone. One could argue that Mary was, in fact, unaware that her actions were being perceived as rude. She may not have realized the severity of using her phone in a dimly-lit theater, where it's easy for others to be distracted by the bright screen. Her primary focus might have been on her own convenience or connectedness, rather than considering how her actions could negatively impact those around her. However, it would be more accurate to say that Mary was unintentionally being rude rather than purposely disregarding the feelings of others. After Rebecca's gentle reminder, Mary promptly turned off her phone to make sure her actions didn't disturb others any further. The situation also highlights the importance of open communication and understanding amongst friends. If Rebecca hadn't spoken up, the distractions caused by Mary's phone usage might have ruined the theater experience for those seated around them. By expressing her concerns, Rebecca was able to prevent any further disturbances and ensure a pleasant time for both herself and her friend, as well as the rest of the audience. Ultimately, the lesson learned from this incident is that when attending a live performance, audience members should always be mindful of the potential impact of their actions on others. Turning off cell phones and other electronic devices plays a crucial role in reducing interruptions and preserving the integrity of the theater-going experience for everyone involved. In conclusion, while it could be perceived that Rebecca was being rude by pointing out Mary's mistake, her actions were actually intended for the betterment of the theater experience as a whole. On the other hand, Mary's cell phone usage could be interpreted as rude, but it may have been unintentional on her part. The key takeaway is that mutual understanding, open communication, and adherence to theater etiquette help create a harmonious environment where everyone can fully enjoy live performances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It appears Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki will step down. There had been concern that after eight years he would try to hold on to power by military force. And correspondent David Martin reports that President Obama is sending about 130 more American military advisers to Iraq. There are 250 in the country already.      They're helping the Iraqi government roll back ISIS, a Muslim extremist army that has taken control of parts of Iraq and Syria.      Obama ordered airstrikes on ISIS when it threatened the Kurdish city of Erbil in northern Iraq. That's where these new American advisers would go, to help thousands of refugees who are surrounded on Mount Sinjar.      On Monday, when an Iraqi helicopter dropped water to help the refugees, some refugees seized the chance and jumped aboard.      On Tuesday, a similar Iraqi mission crashed after it was rushed by refugees. The pilot was killed. Many were injured.      Refugees are fleeing because ISIS militants have murdered, by the thousands, anyone who is not a member of their Sunni Muslim faith.      CBS News discovered what's happening to the Christians.      CBS News      We visited the town of Bartella two months ago, as ISIS militants began their campaign of violence and terror in northern Iraq.      Christians have lived here for at least 1,500 years. They still pray in Aramaic - the language spoken by Christ.      With the Islamic extremists just 10 miles away, Capt. Firaz Jacob and his 600 local militiamen had vowed to protect their home.      We asked what they would do if the militants came to this Christian town?      \\"We don't know,\\" Firaz told us, speaking in Arabic, \\"but maybe they'll do what they've done in other places and kill us.\\"      Capt. Firaz and his men held on until last week when ISIS went on the rampage again, capturing more territory for what they say is their own, Islamic state.      The townspeople fled in the middle of the night. Now, 200 families are crowded into a community hall, including baby Marbel, who was born the same day they ran for their lives.      CBS News      These are proud people who have lost everything and have nowhere to go.      Capt. Firaz is here and told us he was the last to leave Bartella, after everyone else had made it out.      Does he think they will ever be able to go back to Bartella?      \\"If we go back to our town in a few months or a few years we'll be pushed out again,\\" he said. \\"We need somewhere safe to live.\\"      Many people blame the current prime minister, al-Maliki, for fueling religious and ethnic tensions here. He's now isolated and will probably have to leave office. He's lost the support of his Iranian backers as well as the militias that were once loyal to him.      But the question is whether a new government can end those hatreds and unify Iraq. ||||| He's a charismatic figure, the sort that would catch the eye of any good photo editor.      Clad in all black except for the beige kaffiyeh wrapping his face, he stands, arms raised, weapon in one hand, ISIS flag in the other. Through dark aviators, he stares down the camera from just a few feet away.      The picture above, dated June 23, filed by an unnamed photographer, and distributed by Reuters, claims to be of a jihadi militant on the streets of Mosul, two weeks after the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, now called the Islamic State (IS), shocked the world by taking control of Iraq's second-largest city. Time used the image. So did Newsweek, The Daily Beast, The New York Review of Books, and NBC News. And thus, the world got one of its earliest glimpses of Islamic State-controlled Iraq: defiant, in control, triumphant.      The sudden takeover of a wide swath of Iraq by Syria-based militants calling themselves the Islamic State is both one of the biggest stories of the year and one of the hardest for news organizations to cover. The brutality that made ISIS notorious over the course of the Syrian civil war has become a fundamental part of its Iraqi regime. Few journalists have been allowed in by IS's media arms to provide a sense of what life is like under the Islamic State -- which is, in part, why a VICE News documentary that premiered Aug. 7, in which filmmaker Medyan Dairieh spent three weeks with the group, has been generating a stir. Most media coverage of the Islamic State's reign has come from areas of relative safety, such as refugee camps in Kurdistan where those fleeing the jihadi advance have taken shelter, or from those embedded with the Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting against further IS incursions. Few reports have included direct contact with the militants themselves, only with those caught up in their wake.      Except, that is, for the photos.      Shortly after the takeover, a handful of news agencies, including giants like Reuters and the Associated Press (AP), began sending out pictures from Mosul. Shot by anonymous stringers -- that is, freelancers who contribute regularly -- the photos reveal daily life under a self-declared caliphate, and depict everything from raucous demonstrations full of fluttering jihadi flags and weapons-filled checkpoints to more mundane scenes of bustling markets. Taken together, they show a combination of breathtaking brutality, widespread support, and a well-functioning state.      They're also fraught with ethical pitfalls. The use of unnamed freelancers by major news organizations in an area ruled by one of the world's most dangerous militant groups has raised a host of questions, from how these agencies can ensure their journalists' safety to whether they can vouch for the methods of the anonymous photographers working for them -- or these journalists' relationship with the IS fighters they claim to cover.      And as interviews with a few of the photographers currently working within the caliphate indicate, some agencies are willing to work far outside of traditional journalistic norms in order to provide a window into the world now almost entirely cut off from outsiders, in some cases even sacrificing editorial control to militant jihadists -- all in order to get an up-close glimpse of the enemy.      Abu Mirwan -- not his real name -- has worked as a photographer in Iraq for well over a decade. He is now filing photographs for an international agency, he said in a telephone interview in early August. (He wouldn't say which one.) After the IS takeover of Mosul, Mirwan, a Sunni Iraqi, reached out to an agent of the caliphate, who said he could get him permission to work again. The agent was true to his word, Mirwan said. He even shared a pleasant meal with three IS leaders, who told him they would help him by giving him stories and inviting him to see IS events.      The congeniality didn't last long. Mirwan says that a few days later, he was taken to see another member of IS's leadership. It was a very different meeting. The IS leader threatened Mirwan, telling him that if he did anything that damaged IS's reputation, he'd be killed and that if he took any photographs without IS knowledge, he'd be given 100 lashes. From now on, he was told, before he sent out any photos, he'd have to share his memory cards for approval first.      And that's how he's operated since, Mirwan says. IS invites him to cover events, such as military shows and rallies. He photographs them, with a minder in tow, and when he's through, he clears his images with an IS representative before they go out to either the international agency he works with, or to a local agency he works with which then passes them on to its international contacts.      Mirwan was recruited to document IS's recent attack on the town of Sinjar, he says -- the same takeover whose aftermath has prompted U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. There, he was photographing fighting until a few members of ISIS called him over. Thirty men lay waiting facedown on the ground, hands bound behind their backs. Three or four women were standing by, watching. It was an execution.      Take the pictures, he was told.      Mirwan says he's frightened. But the money he makes filing for international agencies is good, he says, and taking photos is the only way he knows to make a living. \\"I've been doing this job for 15 years,\\" he said. \\"This is how I support my family.\\"      Not all imagery coming out of the Islamic State is vetted like Mirwan's. Mohammed (who is also using a pseudonym because he fears IS reprisals) has been working as a journalist for over 10 years and is currently based in Mosul, running a local photo agency, where he has two photographers working under him. In a phone interview in late July, he said his agency sells between seven to 10 photos a day, for about 50 a photo. They work with a variety of different agencies, he says, but mainly with the AP. The agency doesn't know who the stringers supplying its photos are, Mohammed says. He is the AP's only point of contact for his agency's photos.      Mohammed says his photographers operate without IS permission, snapping furtive images via camera phones and transmitting them out of IS territory by satellite. And not all of AP's Mosul photography has been flattering for IS, in the mode of packed rallies and lively markets: The agency has sent out photos, for instance, of Mosul residents walking over rubble -- the aftermath of IS's destruction of the Tomb of Jonah the Prophet, a revered Muslim shrine. Another photo shows an empty park, where a statue of Iraqi poet and cultural icon Adi Tammam once stood.      Mohammed and his photographers do tremendously risky work, but AP is very good to him, he says, and is concerned with his safety: The agency will call to check in on him, and remind him not to take unnecessary risks. But few are willing to take these sorts of chances. Mohammed says he knows of other photographers operating under the same conditions as Mirwan: filing only photos that have been cleared with an IS representative, working out of a TV station in Mosul, who keeps all the images on file.      AP refused Foreign Policy's repeated requests for an interview on its decision to use unnamed stringers in Mosul. However, in an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the agency wrote, \\"The Associated Press is transparent about the source of images we distribute and the safety of our journalists is paramount.\\"      Over email, a Reuters spokesperson did not respond to a list of nine questions including one about whether the agency knows the identity of its stringers in IS-controlled Iraq, and whether it was comfortable with the requirement that any photographer working in Mosul must appear to support IS. Instead, the agency issued a statement saying it \\"chooses a mix of staff and stringers to provide the best coverage ... which is hallmarked by its independence and freedom from bias.\\" It balances the use of staff photographers and stringers based on operational requirements, said spokesman Chris Artis, \\"as well as the deep knowledge of the conflict held by local editors.\\"      News agencies' decisions about whether to rely on stringers in IS territory take place against the backdrop of the intensifying propaganda war unfolding between the Islamic State and the Iraqi government -- one that many have argued IS is winning. The group has shown a particular savvy when it comes to brand management: It maintains active social media accounts, regularly publishing images, including the occasional gruesome beheading or mass execution, which are often picked up by news outlets. The militants have a designated propaganda arm, known as the Al Hayat Media Center, which produces high-production videos and a magazine. And reports from other areas under IS control describe similar attempts to control all information bound for the outside world through similar review processes as those described by Mirwan and Mohamed in Mosul: IS set up an \\"information office\\" in the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor, for instance. For its part, in response to IS's effective public relations efforts, the Iraqi government has issued a set of \\"guidelines\\" for members of the media covering the fight against IS that forbids \\"broadcast[ing] the messages of armed groups or their savage acts\\" while exhorting journalists to praise \\"the heroic acts performed by security personnel,\\" and to \\"broadcast programs that spread enthusiasm and a fighting spirit against terror.\\" (The guidelines were condemned by human rights groups as an attempt to prevent critical coverage.)      Providing anonymity for photographers operating in dangerous territory is a common practice for news organizations, including Reuters and the Associated Press. But the combination of a particularly violent subject, known for its PR savvy, and photographers with whom these agencies have little familiarity and at times almost no contact, is problematic, journalism ethics experts say. By running images from photographers like Mirwan and Mohammed, news organizations open themselves up to charges that they're serving as what Ethical Journalism Network Director Aidan White calls \\"unwilling foot soldiers\\" of extremists in this propaganda war. \\"It's the question of whether or not one is falling into the trap of actually promoting the political interests of\\" the Islamic State, White said.      But while news agencies must be aware of the hazards of allowing a dangerous group to depict itself on its own terms, they must also balance against the value of providing public information about an important newsmaker, said Patrick Baz, Middle East and North Africa editor for Agence France-Presse (AFP). AFP hasn't used stringers in IS-controlled Mosul, but it has distributed the group's own images of what it claims to be executions. They're photos that may be intended to intimidate, Baz says, but they also have what he calls \\"historical value.\\"      \\"We all know it's propaganda, but we all know at the same time that the world needs to see what's going on,\\" he said. \\"Our duty is to ring the alarm bell and say, 'Hey guys, this is what's going on. This is what we've found on these guys' website.'\\"      And conceding some editorial independence for the sake of access isn't a situation unique to the Islamic State, he says. News agencies readily use images distributed by the U.S. army, the Israeli army, or NATO forces, Baz said -- decisions that are rarely, if ever, questioned. And military embeds, for instance, often come only after extensive screenings, and with their own restrictions on coverage (though these are typically couched in terms of security, and aren't accompanied by promises of lashings).      In the buildup to the premier of part one of VICE News' documentary, the company touted its journalist's \\"unprecedented access.\\" Indeed, VICE's cameras appear to go deep into the caliphate, and the footage they capture is chilling: In the first two installments, based in Raqqa, Syria, children as young as 11 pledge loyalty to the caliphate, and IS members give brazen interviews that include pledging to \\"raise the flag of Allah in the White House.\\" There are also happy scenes, of a sort: Men living under IS rule play with children in a river. And front and center, of course, are the demonstrations of Islamic State power: a tank spinning in circles; IS's signature black flag waving from a turret; a parade of stolen Iraqi weapons; a rally in which a crowd is prodded into a call-and-response: \\"The Caliphate!\\" \\"Established!\\"      In an email statement to Foreign Policy, VICE offered no details about the terms of the embed, nor did it share them in an interview with the Huffington Post. It said it offered \\"a previously unseen look at life under the control of this terrifying extremist group\\" and said filmmaker Dairieh \\"has worked in the region's most challenging environments ... and has extensive contacts.\\"      In forthcoming episodes, VICE promises to take viewers further into IS's world. They'll watch prisoners detail how they'll be punished for their crimes, see an IS-run wheat mill, and hear a representative talk about the group's plans to establish schools and factories. Viewers will have no sense of how much of the footage may have been screened ahead of time by the group before airing, or the degree to which IS decided where VICE's cameras would go. The documentary is fascinating. Watching men and young children declare their passion for jihad, seeing masked men on horses patrolling city streets -- it's hard to look away. How much it tells us about the reality of life under a caliphate is an entirely different matter.      Part two of the documentary closes with a scene of an IS recruitment rally, which many attendees are shown filming on their cellphones. \\"The Islamic State has been established,\\" a kaffiyeh-wearing man sings to the gathered crowd. \\"Beautiful virgins are calling; enroll me as a martyr.\\" The crowd stares back. Some sing along. The weapons are held high, and rows of black flags flutter in the background.      Sebastian Meyer contributed reporting from northern Iraq.

Summarize this article: (CNN) Pope Francis on Tuesday radically revised the process by which Catholics may annul their marriages, streamlining steps that many in the church considered too cumbersome and costly.      The move is the latest in a series of reforms by Francis as he seeks to make the church more responsive to the real needs of lay Catholics, especially those who have long felt marginalized by the hierarchy. Without the annulments, Catholics who remarry are not allowed to receive Holy Communion, which many describe as a painful exclusion from the church's chief sacrament.      The Vatican announcement also comes just weeks before Francis makes his first-ever visit to the United States. Americans accounted for about half of the nearly 50,000 annulments granted in 2012, the latest year for which statistics are available.      \\"This move is in accord with the Pope's oft-repeated image of the Church as a 'field hospital' that goes out to meet people where they are most in need, and then to treat their most serious wounds first -- rather than stay at home and wait for people to come to them,\\" said the Rev. James Bretzke, an expert on papal affairs at Boston College.      The three main changes announced on Tuesday are are:      • Eliminating a second review by a cleric before a marriage can be nullified.      • Giving bishops the ability to fast-track and grant the annulments themselves in certain circumstances -- for example, when spousal abuse or an extramarital affair has occurred.      • The process should be free, except for a nominal fee for administrative costs, and should be completed within 45 days.      The Pope's reforms came Tuesday in the form of two \\"motu proprio\\" documents, Latin for \\"by (the Pope's) own initiative.\\" They become part of Catholic canon law on December 8, the beginning of Francis' declared \\"Year of Mercy.\\"      While Francis reaffirmed the \\"indissolubility of the marriage bond,\\" he also said in Tuesday's documents that \\"charity and mercy demand that the Church, as mother, be close to her children who consider themselves separated.\\"      In the end, the church's many laws and institutions must be aimed at one chief purpose, the Pope said -- \\"the salvation of souls.\\"      One prominent Catholic priest called Tuesday's announcement \\"an act of mercy from a pastoral Pope who listens carefully to the concerns of the people.\\"      Francis's streamlining of the annulment process is an act of mercy from a pastoral Pope who listens carefully to the concerns of the people. — James Martin, SJ (@JamesMartinSJ) September 8, 2015      'People give up'      Francis has said that obtaining annulments can be too onerous, dragging on for years and costing hundreds if not thousands of dollars.      \\"Some procedures are so long and so burdensome,\\" the pontiff said in 2014, \\"and people give up.\\"      Here's what one former Catholic had to say: \\"25 years ago this would have changed my life. They wanted 8000 to process my husband's annulment! I'm a Jew now,\\" Desirée O'Clair tweeted.      25 years ago this would have changed my life. They wanted 8000 to process my husband's annulment!

That's lower than the general population, but still equivalent to 11 million adults.      The Catholic Church does not recognize civil divorces. Instead, its theology holds that marital unions sanctified by God are indissoluble.      Annulments, once available only through church tribunals, state that the marriage contract was fundamentally flawed from the start, and hence invalid in the eyes of the church. In the 1980s, the church added another step to the process , requiring a second review before an annulment can be granted.      Without an annulment, a divorced Catholic who remarries is considered an adulterer and may not participate in some sacraments, including Holy Communion. Led by Pope Francis, the church is holding high-level meetings, called synods, to debate that teaching. The next synod is to be held in October.      The 'Year of Mercy'      Tuesday's announcement is yet another step in Francis' efforts to reform the church, making it more welcoming to those who may have felt excluded after running afoul of Catholic teachings.      On September 1, he announced that during an upcoming \\"Year of Mercy,\\" Catholic priests around the world will be able to forgive the \\"sin\\" of abortion. Under canon law, absolution of certain serious sins, including abortion, is usually reserved only to bishops.      With the abortion and annulment announcements, Francis seems to be signaling a \\"third way\\" to govern the church through thorny issues. He's not rewriting core doctrines, but he is encouraging Catholic clergy to be more merciful and at times more flexible in how they enforce church rules.      Francis' experience in his native Argentina, where many of his parishioners were poor, gives him a different view of the church and how its complex set of rules can alienate some Catholics, said Andrew Chesnut, an expert on religion in Latin America and a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.      Chesnut called the Pope's annulment proposal part of an overall strategy to create a more inclusive church and reach out to lapsed Catholics who might have left the fold over issues such as divorce, abortion and homosexuality.      \\"The church has been in sharp decline in both Latin America and Europe,\\" Chesnut said, \\"and Pope Francis sees such reforms as key to reversing the long-term slide.\\"      It remains to be seen, though, how conservative Catholics receive the changes. Many have argued in recent years that the church should hold a firm line against what they see as widespread sexual immorality, particularly in the modern West. ||||| After his speech to Congress, Pope Francis speaks to a crowd at St. Patrick Church in Washington, D.C. and meets with throngs of admirers at a Catholic Charities feeding event for the homeless.

Pope Francis radically reformed the Catholic Church's process for annulling marriages Tuesday, allowing for fast-track decisions and removing automatic appeals in a bid to speed up and simplify the procedure.      By Philip Pullella      VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Tuesday made it simpler and swifter for Catholics to secure a marriage annulment, the most radical such reform for 250 years, and told bishops to be more welcoming to divorced couples.      Under the old norms, it often took years to win an annulment, with hefty legal fees attached. Francis said the procedure should be free and the new rules mean that a marriage might be declared null and void in just 45 days in some cases.      The announcement came the week after Francis signaled a more merciful approach to women who had obtained abortions and was another sign of his drive to shake up the hidebound Roman Catholic Church and try to soften some of its more rigid rules.      In a document known as a Motu Proprio, Latin for \\"by his own initiative\\", Francis reaffirmed traditional teaching on the \\"indissolubility of marriage\\", making clear that the Vatican was not in any form promoting or sanctioning divorce.      However, he said he would make it easier for separated couples to obtain an annulment -- a ruling whereby the Church decides that a marriage was not valid in the first place because certain prerequisites such as free will, psychological maturity and openness to having children were lacking.      View gallery Pope Francis greets newlyweds during the general audience in the Paul VI hall at the Vatican, Wednes …      Francis eliminated a previously mandatory review of an annulment decision by a second tribunal and gave bishops sweeping powers to judge quickly the most clear-cut cases.      He said he had decided to streamline procedures so that Catholics who sought annulments should not be \\"long oppressed by darkness of doubt\\" over whether they could have their marriages declared null and void.      MOST CHANGE IN 250 YEARS      Monsignor Pio Vito Pinto, dean of the Vatican appeals court that rules on annulments, told a news conference the new rules were the most substantive changes to the laws since the papacy of Benedict XIV, who reigned from 1740 to 1758.      \\"The pope is seeking to respond pastorally to the tens of thousands of couples who are experiencing profound pain and alienation as a result of broken marriages,\\" said Father James Bretzke, theology professor at Boston College.      Francis took charge of the 1.2 billion member Church in 2013, replacing Pope Benedict, a theological hardliner well liked by conservatives for seeking to reaffirm traditional Catholic identity.      The Argentine pope has appeared a much more approachable figure and has spoken repeatedly of the need for the Church to show mercy and understand the needs of Catholics struggling to live by its rules.      Catholics who divorce and remarry in civil ceremonies are considered by the Church to be still married to their first spouse and living in a state of sin. This bars them from receiving sacraments such as communion.      While not changing this position, Francis wrote on Tuesday that bishops should show \\"particular pastoral concern\\" for divorced and remarried Catholics.      Many couples and priests have complained that the complex procedures discourage even those with legitimate grounds for an annulment from trying to obtain one.      Some 50,000 annulment procedures were launched last year, nearly half of them in the United States, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University.      Francis is due to pay a landmark visit to the United States next month, where his progressive views on climate change and condemnation of rampant capitalism look certain to put him at loggerheads with Republican presidential hopefuls.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the most logical next event? How to organize your bills  Open and file your bills right away.  Put all your bills in the same place once you receive and open them. For mailed bills, this could be a desk or mail center in your home.","output":"For online bills, create a folder in your email or a dedicated space in a digital filing system, such as Dropbox or Google Drive. This will ensure that all your bills are easily accessible in one place, reducing the chances of missing a payment or misplacing a bill. The most logical next event in organizing your bills is to establish a system for tracking them and setting reminders for due dates. This can be achieved through the following steps: 1. Make a master list of all your regular bills: Create a comprehensive list of all your recurring bills including utilities, loans, credit cards, rent or mortgage, insurance, and any other bills that you need to pay regularly. Make a note of their approximate due dates, frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually), and the average amount for each bill. 2. Choose a tracking method: Select a bill tracking method that works best for you. Options include: a spreadsheet, a physical calendar, an app or software, or a simple handwritten list. Apps like Mint, Prism, and Honeydue are specifically designed for tracking expenses, bills, and due dates on your smartphone or tablet. If you prefer a more traditional option, use a wall calendar or planner dedicated to bill payment tracking. 3. Input bill details: For each bill on your master list, input the required details in your chosen tracking method. This includes the bill name or description, due date, frequency, amount, and any reference numbers, such as account or invoice numbers. 4. Set reminders: Setting reminders for bill due dates is crucial to ensure timely payments and avoid late fees. For digital tracking methods, create reminders or alerts at least a week before each due date. For physical calendars or planners, use highlighters, colored pens, or sticky notes to draw attention to due dates. 5. Consolidate bill payments: To simplify your bill management, schedule and group your bill payments around one or two dates each month, if possible. This way, you can tackle multiple bills at once, reducing the likelihood of missing any due dates. 6. Organize bill payment methods: Choose the most convenient payment methods for you. These may include mailing a check, paying online, using automatic payments, or paying in person. Store payment information securely, such as account login details and passwords, either digitally or in a secure physical location. 7. Create a filing system for paid bills: Once your bills are paid, file the payment confirmations in an organized manner, either digitally or physically. This will help you keep track of your financial history and easily access documentation in the event of a dispute or issue with a bill. 8. Regularly review and update your bill tracking system: Make it a habit to review your bill tracking system at least once a week to ensure that you're staying on top of your due dates and staying organized. Update the system as needed, for example, when you add or remove a bill or when there are changes to your payment amounts or due dates. By following these steps, you can create an efficient bill organization system that will not only improve your financial management but also reduce stress and the risk of late payments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If as a baby, how was he brought up, and, if as a man, how old was he as soon as he was born?","output":"While both questions address the creation of Adam (and to some extent, Eve) in the biblical narrative, they differ in perspective and scope. The first question, \\"Were Adam and Eve babies like the rest of us or were they made as adult-bodied people?\\" seeks a more straightforward answer on whether the first human beings were created as babies or adults. It focuses on comparing the creation of Adam and Eve to the natural human developmental process. The second question, \\"Biblical Figures: How was 'Adam' created, as a baby or a man? If as a baby, how was he brought up, and, if as a man, how old was he as soon as he was born?\\" examines the creation of Adam more intricately, by contemplating possible scenarios based on the mode of his creation. It enquires about the upbringing of Adam if he were created as a baby, and about his age at the moment he was created as a man. The second question digs deeper into the implications of each possibility, while the first one presents a more generalized query. To provide a comprehensive answer to both questions, we can explore the biblical account of their creation. In the Bible, specifically in the book of Genesis, Adam—the first human—is created by God out of the \\"dust of the ground\\" (Genesis 2:7). God forms him as an adult man and breathes life into him. Since Adam is created in this way, he does not experience infancy or childhood but rather begins his existence as a fully-formed adult. Eve, the first woman, is also created as an adult. According to Genesis 2:21-22, God takes one of Adam's ribs while he sleeps and creates Eve from this rib. Like Adam, Eve does not undergo infancy and development but begins her existence as an adult woman. In conclusion, while both questions delve into the creation and age of Adam and, to some extent, Eve, they differentiate in terms of their perspective and the depth of their inquiry. Nevertheless, the biblical account indicates that both Adam and Eve were created as adult-bodied individuals, bypassing conventional infant and childhood stages."},{"instruction":"Q:Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials.

By Giancarlo RinaldiSouth Scotland reporter, BBC Scotland news website His son, Alan, took his own life at Lockerbie railway station in June 2015 aged just 31. After the funeral, Mr Ritchie decided to find out all he could about suicide and what more could be done to help people like his boy. It was not about blame, more about focus and purpose, he explained. \\"I've spent the last two years in a sense investigating the many charities that are involved in mental health in Dumfries and Galloway,\\" he said. \\"And what I hope to do within the next year or so is focus on perhaps one or two. \\"I am finding out about all of these charities and then focusing in on maybe one or two where I can be of best use to them. \\"There are many, many charities out there and many people are perhaps not aware of that and aware of the help that they can get if they can just get to the website or a telephone number or something like that.\\" He said the Scottish government was already doing good work to raise awareness of mental health with a 10-year action plan and its work on a suicide reduction strategy which he has been involved with. \\"That's where I hope that I can spread the message and signpost to people who may wish to help,\\" he said. He recently spoke to a group of 50 mental health nursing students and, through what he describes as his \\"journey\\" with his own son, he feels he can help others to understand the issue. \\"He wasn't a youngster who hid his depression and anxiety - he was very willing to talk about it,\\" he said. \\"He spent really half his lifetime seeking ways to help him cope with his anxiety and depression - medication, therapy, going to Samye Ling and so on.\\" 'Lot of strength' Mr Ritchie said that if someone facing mental health challenges could talk to someone it could help their journey to \\"discovery and recovery\\" rather than feeling isolated and alone. He said: \\"It takes a lot of strength to actually admit: 'I don't feel well, there is something wrong with me psychologically and I need help.' \\"That can sometimes be something which they suppress all the time until perhaps it is too late. \\"Listening is very, very important.\\" He added that simply telling someone to \\"man up\\" - as was often done - was not the way to help. He said: \\"That's not the right answer - the right answer should be: 'Let's sit down, let's talk about it, let's discuss it and let's see where, if you feel you want help, you can get help.'\\" 'Strictest confidence' Mr Ritchie said that employers could also have a part to play. \\"A good organisation, a caring organisation will call in such charities as, say Samaritans, who will talk to employees about what work they do,\\" he said. He said that it sometimes helped to talk to an outsider. \\"Some people who have these mental health challenges don't necessarily want to discuss it or open up to family and friends but they may wish to open up to somebody who is impartial, who is non-judgmental, who is a stranger,\\" he said. \\"They can speak to you in the strictest confidence. \\"When you are talking to people about their problems and their issues it is so important you listen and you don't judge and you don't particularly give advice.\\" Occasions like World Mental Health Day, which falls on 10 October, help to highlight these issues. 'Help at hand' Mr Ritchie, from Lockerbie, said he had found local politicians had also been willing to spread the word about mental health and the help available. In some circumstances he believes it is appropriate to contact the emergency services - or seek urgent medical help. \\"If you are in a crisis and you are feeling so low that you may wish to injure yourself or take your own life - call an ambulance, talk to a friend, talk to a member of your family, go to A&E. \\"That's not just a personal thing that is actually written within the strategy that I have looked at through the Scottish Parliament.\\" He said that was an option many people might not have thought about. \\"If you break your leg, or you're in a car accident or suddenly you've got a terrible sore stomach or a blinding headache you go to A&E,\\" he said. \\"If you're depressed, if you're low if you don't know where to turn then phone Samaritans or go to A&E and take it from there, help is at hand.\\" Output:","output":"Part #1: Identify the main topic of the text.

(2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \\"Ethio-Somali\\". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai Peninsula.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? feels homogenized and a bit contrived ,","output":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"feels homogenized and a bit contrived\\" can be interpreted as negative. Here's a detailed explanation as to why: 1. \\"Homogenized\\" - This term indicates that the movie lacks uniqueness or distinctiveness and appears similar to other films in its genre or presentation. When a work is described as homogenized, it suggests that the creative aspects of the film are not standing out or offering something fresh and different for the viewer. This can lead to disappointment and a sense of déjà vu while watching the movie, which is generally perceived as a negative aspect. The reviewer might feel that the filmmakers did not take any risks or employ innovative ideas to set the movie apart from the rest. 2. \\"A bit contrived\\" - The phrase \\"a bit contrived\\" suggests that certain elements of the movie feel forced or unnatural. This could refer to the plot, the dialogue, the relationships between the characters, or any other aspect of the film that doesn't seem to flow organically or naturally. When a movie is described as contrived, it implies that the filmmakers might have attempted to manipulate the audience's emotions or reactions by using clichéd or overly predetermined elements. This kind of inauthenticity is generally not well received by viewers, and it negatively impacts their overall enjoyment of the movie.

I have a new situation: two countries of similar natural resources had different populations. Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population.  But I can use this background: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.  What is an answer for this question: Which country had an increased food supply?","output":"Based on the background information provided, it can be inferred that Italy, with its smaller population, would have had an increased food supply when compared to Spain, which had a larger population.

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question Lee has a new job, and as part of his training, he needs to learn certain tasks. One of these tasks is to separate the corn from the chaff. Step 2: Analyze the task Separating the corn from the chaff is a process where the valuable, edible part of the grain (corn) is separated from the worthless, inedible part (chaff).

The context suggests that the objective is to use each part—corn and chaff—separately, indicating that they have different purposes or uses. Step 4: Justify the decision Lee did this task because it is essential to separate the valuable corn from the chaff so that they can be used individually for their specific purposes.

The term was coined in 1808 by the early nineteenth century German educational reformer and theologian Friedrich Niethammer and gradually adopted into English. Niethammer had wished to introduce into German education the humane values of ancient Greece and Rome. Niethhammer was a Lutheran theologian. Since the twentieth century, however, Anglophone humanist movements have usually been aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world.  - Norwegian literature is literature composed in Norway or by Norwegian people.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's break down the given information step by step. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise seems to be about belief in shooting someone who is in the process of committing rape. It does not directly mention that no one is raped or killed. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states that no one is raped or killed. This is a separate idea that is not explicitly discussed in the premise. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we find that they are discussing different ideas. The premise is focused on the act of shooting someone in the process of committing rape, while the hypothesis is concerned with the absence of rape or killing. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the hypothesis ('No one is raped or killed') is not entailed by the premise ('and I believe also in shooting of a rape, I mean killing a rape victim, or I mean someone in the process of rape'). The premise does not provide enough information to support or imply the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

It's easy enough to pick the first thing you notice about someone and compliment it. You could say \\" i like your shirt \\" or \\" nice hair \\" to just about anyone, but a good compliment goes deeper.","output":"A good compliment is one that is honest, specific, and meaningful to the person receiving it. To create a genuine and impactful compliment, it's essential to take the time to observe and appreciate the person's qualities, efforts, or achievements. This involves truly engaging with that individual, getting to know them, and demonstrating your admiration or appreciation for something they excel in, take pride in, or put effort into. Putting it all together, your compliment will leave a lasting impression and contribute positively to their self-esteem and well-being. To craft a powerful compliment, follow these key guidelines: 1. Be observant: Pay attention to the person's actions, qualities, interests, or aspirations. Note down any unique or admirable traits, things they excel in, or moments where they shine. 2. Be specific: Once you've identified something praiseworthy, try to be as precise as possible in your compliment. Mention the specific aspect or quality that impressed or inspired you, ensuring that the person understands what exactly you appreciate about them. 3. Be genuine: Make sure your compliment comes from an authentic place and is not motivated by any ulterior motives. People are generally adept at detecting insincere flattery, so it's crucial to genuinely believe what you are saying. If your compliment is heartfelt and sincere, it's more likely the person will feel encouraged and valued. 4. Be timely: Offer your compliment when the situation is relevant and appropriate. For example, if you were impressed by a co-worker's presentation, don't wait days or weeks to mention it; the impact of your compliment may have significantly decreased by then. Give your compliment soon after you notice their positive attribute, effort, or achievement. 5. Be mindful of context: Respect the person's cultural and social preferences when giving a compliment. Some people may feel overwhelmed or embarrassed when receiving compliments, so it's essential to gauge their comfort level and adjust your approach accordingly. Whether you offer your compliment in private or in front of others, be considerate of the individual's preferences. 6. Be confident: Confidence in delivering your compliment is vital. Maintain eye contact, use a clear and steady voice, and be sure to smile while offering your compliment. Your confidence will communicate the sincerity of your message, ensuring the recipient takes it to heart. In conclusion, giving a powerful compliment involves recognizing and appreciating someone's efforts, achievements, or qualities by being observant, genuine, specific, timely, and mindful of context. By following these guidelines, you can make a positive and lasting impact on the person you're complimenting, strengthening your relationship and contributing to their personal growth. Remember that effective compliments can inspire people to be better versions of themselves and leave them with a lasting sense of pride and accomplishment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They had noticed that Tivo had dropped the lifetime fee for multi-service households from 399 to 299. The narrator, being part of a multi-service household, wanted to ensure that they could take advantage of this reduced fee before signing up for the service. Evidently, they had been following the pricing changes closely, perhaps because the pricing and fees associated with Tivo's services were important factors in their decision-making process. They might have been comparing Tivo's offers with those of other service providers, or they may have been waiting for a more budget-friendly deal before they committed to using the service. Knowing that the previously higher fees might no longer be applicable prompted the narrator to contact Tivo and inquire about whether they can apply this 100 discount to their own account. This step demonstrates their initiative in seeking out the most favorable terms for themselves to ensure they are getting the best possible deal for their multi-service household.

In response to the 1966 ruling by the International Court of Justice, South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) military wing, People's Liberation Army of Namibia, a guerrilla group began their armed struggle for independence, but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its occupation of Namibia, in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region. During the South African occupation of Namibia, white commercial farmers, most of whom came as settlers from South Africa and represented 0.2% of the national population, owned 74% of the arable land. Outside the central-southern area of Namibia (known as the \\"Police Zone\\" since the German era and which contained the main towns, industries, mines and best arable land), the country was divided into \\"homelands\\", the version of South African bantustan applied to Namibia, although only a few were actually established because indigenous Namibians often did not cooperate.

During the apartheid era in South Africa, which lasted from 1948 to the early 1990s, the government implemented policies that favored white people, who made up a minority of the population. One such policy was the Land Acts, which severely restricted black people's ownership of land. By the late 20th century, it is estimated that white people, who comprised around 10% of the population, owned about 80% to 85% of the arable land in South Africa.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...  Paragraph: Mike is studying for his zoology class. Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which class of animals would have better separation of  oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B? Answer:","output":"From the information provided in the text, the class of animals that would have better separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams would be class A. Class A in the context defined by Mike corresponds to reptiles. It's mentioned in the text that the heart of reptiles resembles that of amphibians, but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. Therefore, reptiles, or in Mike's categorization, class A, would have better separation of these bloodstreams."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Lobbyist The answer is:","output":"Title: The Rise of Eddie Genre: Political Drama Plot: Act 1: Eddie Huxley, a charismatic and ambitious man in his mid-30s, has always been intrigued by the world of politics. Born and raised in a small town in the Midwest, he slowly climbs the political ladder as a local councilman and eventually becomes the mayor of his town. Despite his humble beginnings, Eddie has always dreamt of making it big in the world of politics and achieving a significant political office in the U.S. Meanwhile, Eddie's long-time friend and political advisor, Olivia Johnston, recognizes his potential and encourages him to push his ambitions further. Olivia, who has been a lobbyist and a seasoned political operator on the national level for years, sees greatness in Eddie and believes that he could become a powerful figure within the U.S. political system. She convinces Eddie to move to Washington D.C. to be closer to the epicenter of American politics. Act 2: After relocating to the capital, Eddie learns the inside workings of the political machine and becomes fascinated by the power and influence lobbyists wield behind the scenes. With Olivia's guidance and connections, Eddie starts forging relationships with key people in Congress and amasses a clientele of wealthy corporations and interest groups, successfully lobbying on their behalf. Soon, Eddie becomes a well-known and respected lobbyist in D.C., using his charm and strategic mind to navigate the treacherous waters of American politics. He makes a name for himself, and his influence begins to grow alongside his aspirations. However, achieving such a lofty status comes with its consequences. To maintain and expand his power and influence, Eddie is forced to make some ethically dubious choices, even compromising some of his own morals along the way. These decisions strain his relationship with Olivia, who is concerned that Eddie is losing sight of his original goal and becoming too complacent in his new role, mirroring the very politicians they had once spoken against. Act 3: As Eddie's reputation as a formidable lobbyist grows, so does the scrutiny from the media and an ambitious investigative journalist named Susan Wells. Susan starts to dig deeper into Eddie's past and lobbying activities, uncovering several scandals and corrupt deals. As the pressure mounts, Eddie faces the dilemma of either coming clean and risking his entire career or continuing down the path and jeopardizing his integrity. Simultaneously, Olivia discovers a secret about one of Eddie's most powerful clients, a corrupt multi-billion-dollar corporation with plans to exploit and abuse vulnerable populations. Unable to sit by idly any longer, Olivia urges Eddie to take a stand, let go of his ambitions, and fight for the greater good. Facing a moral crossroads, Eddie must choose between his unyielding quest for power and the opportunity to redeem himself and preserve the values he started with. In a climactic turn of events, Eddie sides with Olivia, risking his reputation and career in the process. Together, they expose the corporation's sinister plan and help bring justice to those affected. Through their courage and determination, Eddie and Olivia rekindle their friendship and recommit themselves to the ideals of public service. Epilogue: Eddie eventually obtains the office of United States Senator for his home state, having built a new political career based on integrity and advocating for change. His transformation from a power-hungry lobbyist to a morally upright, public servant is a testament to the importance of staying true to one's principles in a world plagued by corruption and secrecy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He has written more than 30 plays and nearly the same number of movie screenplays, mostly adaptations of his plays. He has received more combined Oscar and Tony nominations than any other writer. Simon grew up in New York during the Great Depression, with his parents' financial hardships affecting their marriage, giving him a mostly unhappy and unstable childhood. Simon's characters are typically portrayed as \\"imperfect, unheroic figures who are at heart decent human beings\\", according to Koprince, and she traces Simon's style of comedy to that of Menander, a playwright of ancient Greece. Menander, like Simon, also used average people in domestic life settings, the stories also blending humor and tragedy into his themes. Many of Simon's most memorable plays are built around two-character scenes, as in segments of California Suite and Plaza Suite.  Before writing, Simon tries to create an image of his characters. He says that the play, Star Spangled Girl which was a box-office failure, was \\"the only play I ever wrote where I did not have a clear visual image of the characters in my mind as I sat down at the typewriter.\\" Simon considers \\"character building\\" as an obligation, stating that the \\"trick is to do it skillfully\\". While other writers have created vivid characters, they have not created nearly as many as Simon: \\"Simon has no peers among contemporary comedy playwrights,\\" states biographer Robert Johnson.

He says that \\"the looseness of soil has a positive impact on a plant 's roots' growth in that soil\\" and \\"roots are basic to growth, development and expansion\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Possible answers: (i). support (ii). soft soil (iii). clay soil (iv). no soil (v). nutrients (vi). alluvial (vii). sandy soil (viii). loose soil A:","output":"Based on the hints given by the teacher, we can infer that the best answer to the question \\"What soil helps a plant grow?\\" is (viii). loose soil. The teacher mentioned that \\"the looseness of soil has a positive impact on a plant's roots' growth in that soil.\\" Loose soil is indeed an important factor in plant growth. When soil has a loose structure, it allows for better penetration of water and oxygen. These elements are necessary for the process of nutrient uptake and root growth, which aids in the overall growth and development of the plant. Furthermore, the teacher stated that \\"roots are basic to growth, development and expansion.\\" This statement highlights the importance of strong and healthy root systems for plants. Healthy roots hold plants in place, absorb water and essential nutrients, and store sugars and carbohydrates that provide energy for growth. Considering the choices given, some soils are better than others for plant growth: (i). Support is not a soil type but rather a characteristic that is important in plant growth. (ii). Soft soil is relatively vague, without specific information about its composition or structure. (iii). Clay soil can be high in nutrients, but it is generally heavy and compacted, restricting root growth. (iv). No soil is not an ideal environment, as it lacks essential components of growth. (v). Nutrients are essential for plant growth, but they do not constitute a type of soil. (vi). Alluvial soil, deposited by rivers, is often fertile and can be suitable for plant growth, but it doesn't necessarily indicate looseness. (vii). Sandy soil is very loose, but it drains quickly and lacks the water retention needed for many plants. Given the list of possible answers and the focus on soil looseness provided by the teacher's hints, the best answer is (viii). loose soil. This type of soil creates an optimal environment for root growth, which in turn allows plants to access the water and nutrients required for their overall development and expansion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this lower case.","output":"to appoint to those who mourn in zion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of yahweh, that he may be glorified. The verse you provided is from Isaiah 61:3, which belongs to the Hebrew Bible and is also part of the Old Testament in Christian Bibles. This specific verse is a part of the Book of Isaiah, traditionally attributed to the Prophet Isaiah himself. The Book of Isaiah in its entirety contains 66 chapters divided into two main sections: chapters 1-39 and 40-66. The first section presents a series of condemnations and warnings for the people of Israel, while the latter section revolves around visions of hope and comfort as they face adversity. Isaiah 61:3 is found in the second section, where the verses are primarily characterized by themes of hope, comfort, and restoration. This specific verse outlines God's promise to bestow various blessings upon those who are in mourning or experiencing hardships in Zion, bringing solace and joy to their lives, as they remain faithful to their beliefs. The transformation of \\"ashes to garlands\\" symbolizes the shift from grief, pain, and desolation to a state of joy, beauty, and celebration. Similarly, the \\"oil of joy\\" is an important representation of God's healing and soothing presence, signifying the replacement of mourning and sorrow with happiness. \\"The garment of praise\\" metaphor represents the power of praise and worship as a tool to replace heaviness and despair with an uplifted spirit and rejoicing. By exchanging a sense of defeat and desperation with gratitude and positive energy, individuals can experience a spiritual renewal that brings them closer to God. The verse also introduces the concept that these individuals will become \\"trees of righteousness\\" and \\"the planting of Yahweh.\\" The tree is a common biblical symbol of stability, growth, and strength. As these individuals grow into faithful followers of God, they become strong and firmly rooted in their faith, resembling healthy trees that have been planted by Yahweh Himself. Ultimately, this transformation will result in God being glorified through their faithfulness and spiritual growth. In sum, Isaiah 61:3 exemplifies a message of hope and encouragement for those in mourning and despair. By receiving God's blessings and support, they can not only find solace and happiness but also be transformed into steadfast followers who glorify their Creator. By putting this verse into lower case, as you requested, the emphasis remains clear on the powerful message contained within, while the stylistic change serves as a reminder that the essence of the verse is embedded in the powerful themes it conveys, rather than its grammatical presentation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

RK is the cathode resistor and Rtot is the parallel combination of RP ( external plate resistor ) and Rload .","output":"First, let's break down the content in both statements: (a) RK is the cathode resistor and rtot is the external combination of RP (parallel resistor) and rload. (b) RK is the cathode resistor and Rtot is the parallel combination of RP (external plate resistor) and Rload. To evaluate if both statements have the same meaning, we will analyze each of the components used in the phrases: 1. RK: In both statements, RK is referred to as the cathode resistor. This term remains consistent in both, demonstrating that they are describing the same component. 2. rtot vs. Rtot: It seems that the only difference here is the capitalization of the letters. In the context of the statements, these terms should be treated as interchangeable, as they both likely represent the total resistance in the circuit. 3. RP: In statement (a), RP is referred to as the parallel resistor, and in statement (b), RP is described as the external plate resistor. Although the terms used to describe the resistor are different, both point to a resistor that is in parallel with another resistor in the circuit. This subtle difference in wording may indicate the same element being described, given the overall context. 4. rload vs. Rload: Similar to rtot and Rtot, this difference lies in capitalization. Considering the context, these terms should be treated as interchangeable, both representing the load resistance in the circuit. 5. External combination vs. parallel combination: In both statements, there is a description of how the resistors are combined, impacting the overall resistance. Statement (a) mentions the external combination of RP and rload, while statement (b) specifies the parallel combination of RP and Rload. From the context, the term \\"external combination\\" in statement (a) most likely implies a parallel connection as well, as there are no other resistors being discussed. Thus, these terms can be assumed to have the same meaning. Based on the analysis above, both statements (a) and (b) convey the same meaning but with different wordings and capitalizations. They both describe the same circuit components (RK, RP, and Rload) and their relationships (parallel combination).

A website has been ordered to remove a claim that the MMR jab could cause autism in children by the Advertising Standards Agency. The children’s immunisation service, babyjabs.co.uk, claimed experts believe the vaccine 'could be causing autism in up to 10% of. autistic children in the UK'. It also said: 'Most experts now agree that the. large rise (in autism) has been caused partly by increased diagnosis, but. also by a real increase in the number of children with autism.' The babyjabs website says it enables parents to make an 'informed choice' about child vaccinations. It added that parental fears the jab caused autism. were 'supported' by the fact that the the vaccine strain measles had. been found in the guts and brains of some autistic children. However, the ASA said both the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health have found no evidence of a causal link between MMR and autism. The ASA ruled: 'Consumers were likely to infer from the claim, that the ‘real increase in the number of children with autism’ was not just down to increased diagnosis, but the vaccine might have played a role in bringing about that increase.' They added: 'Because we had not seen supporting evidence that that was the case, and understood that that position was also contradicted by general medical opinion, we concluded that the claim was misleading.' BabyJabs Ltd denied a breach citing previous scientific research which had concluded: 'We cannot rule out the existence of a susceptible subgroup with an increased risk of autism if vaccinated'. But the ASA said: 'The Cochrane review, looking at the general evidence available, could find no significant association between MMR immunisation and autism. 'We noted that the evidence provided by the advertiser included studies and an article which looked at the increased prevalence of autism, but did not include evidence that any increase was due to the MMR vaccine.'

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"PSR B1919+21 is also known as LGM-1. \\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it's accurate to say that PSR B1919+21 is also known as LGM-1. This nickname, which stands for \\"little green men,\\" came about due to the power and regularity of the signals emitted by this pulsar. When they were first discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish on November 28, 1967, the nature of these signals led some to speculate, if only briefly, that they might be coming from an extraterrestrial beacon.   Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation out of their magnetic poles. This radiation can only be observed when the beam of emission is pointing towards the Earth, much the same way a lighthouse can only be seen when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer. This is what gives pulsars a pulsed appearance, with the interval between pulses equivalent to the rotational period of the neutron star.  In the specific case of PSR B1919+21, this pulsar has both a period — the time between pulses — of 1.3373 seconds and a pulse width — the duration of each pulse — of 0.04 seconds. This steady, rapid-fire emission of signals every 1.34 seconds, combined with the precisely tuned nature of the signals, would have set it apart from the general background noise of the universe. This uniqueness is presumably what led to the initial speculation of an artificial, extraterrestrial source. With the source soon determined to be a pulsar, the first ever discovered, the LGM-1 nickname appears to have persisted as a humorous or historical reference to the initial confusion. So while this clever nickname may not be the most scientifically accurate or frequently used designation for PSR B1919+21, it is undeniably part of its history and provides a fascinating glimpse into the process and progress of astronomical discovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SCP auctions says the 1857 papers called the \\"Laws of Base Ball\\" sold early Sunday to an anonymous buyer after more than two weeks of bidding, reports the AP. The auction house had predicted prior to the auction's April 7 start that they could sell for more than 1 million. The anonymous seller hadn't realized the value of the papers he purchased in Texas for 12,000 in 1999. It was only when the auction house appraised them that their significance became clear.

The AP has much more on Doc Adams here. Article:","output":"Title: The Magna Carta of Baseball: Documents Sell for 3.3 Million, Rewriting Baseball's History and Crediting Doc Adams as the True Father of the Sport The Magna Carta of Baseball, a collection of 1857 documents known as the \\"Laws of Base Ball,\\" has been sold for an astounding 3.3 million at auction—an event that has sent shockwaves through the world of baseball and its historians. The documents, which not only hold great monetary value but are also historically profound, were auctioned off to an anonymous buyer after two weeks of bidding. Although the auction house had predicted a sales price of over 1 million, the final tally far exceeded expectations, leaving many in awe of the significance of these critical papers. However, it wasn't always clear just how valuable these documents were. In 1999, their owner, who remains anonymous, purchased the papers in Texas for a mere 12,000, unaware of the stories they would soon reveal. It was only when the auction house appraised these papers that their true significance became clear—the documents shed new light on the early history of baseball, crediting Daniel Lucius \\"Doc\\" Adams as the father of the modern game and placing the birth of baseball three years earlier than previously believed. Daniel Lucius \\"Doc\\" Adams, a figure who may not have been as well-known as other supposed pioneers of the game, such as Abner Doubleday and Alexander Cartwright, now takes his rightful place as the key player in the inception and development of baseball as we know it today. It was Adams who set the foundation for the modern game with his vision and his tireless efforts in the mid 19th-century. He thoroughly developed the sport, overseeing countless rule changes, equipment improvements, and even the very design of the baseball field. The sale of the Laws of Base Ball not only made headlines for the substantial sum it commanded but also for the historical revelations brought forth as a result of the auction. The discovery of these documents has most assuredly rewritten the history of the game, placing baseball's dawn three years earlier than previously thought. This information reshapes our understanding of baseball's growth as a truly American sport, evolving from its English predecessors like rounders and cricket to take on a unique identity that would come to define American pastimes for generations to come. In conclusion, the sale of the Magna Carta of Baseball serves as a shining example of the importance of historical documents in shaping not only the past of the sports we love but also providing a greater understanding of the present and the sports' development over time. The auction has elevated Daniel Lucius \\"Doc\\" Adams to his rightful position as the true father of modern baseball, and the documents' astonishing value serves to strengthen the passion and love for one of America's most storied sports. With the Laws of Base Ball now in the hands of a collector, it is a powerful reminder that our evolution as a society is continuously influenced and shaped by history—and sometimes that history can be worth millions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Determine if the hypothesis can be directly concluded from the premise To be able to conclude the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, there must be a strong connection between the two statements.

Step 3: Consider alternative explanations There can be other reasons for the girl to be balancing on the wall.

The act of balancing alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude she is an aspiring ballerina.

In Europe, the Germans are close to surrender, but in the Pacific the bloody battle for Okinawa is still underway and an invasion of the Japanese home islands is not foreseen until the autumn. American battle casualties have almost reached 900,000, with Japanese casualties at 1.1 million, and some 8 million Asian civilians have died in the war that began with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. The new president knows nothing about the nuclear weapons being developed at Los Alamos, and he must soon decide on whether to use them and how. The US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, has doubts even about the wisdom of the American fire-bombing raids on Japan. \\"One of these Gadgets [bombs]\\", U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes says, \\"could end the war in one blow.\\" When nuclear physicist Leo Szilard delivers a petition signed by 73 scientists urging the president not to deploy the bomb, Byrnes tells him: \\"You do not spend two billion dollars and then show them [American voters] nothing.\\" The film suggests that Byrnes never mentioned Szilard's visit to the president. Also urging deployment is Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. \\"We've come this far\\", Groves says; \\"there's no going back.\\" A demonstration is ruled out because \\"it might be a dud.\\" In Japan, the strong man is Gen.

Article: The mystery stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are famous all over the world. The detective in his stories is called Sherlock Holmes. He solves mysteries in a most surprising way. His assistant, Dr Watson, watches with admiration and then writes up the story of the mystery afterwards. This is a useful story writing skill. Because Watson is not very clever, the story remains a mystery until the end. The readers can sometimes pick up some clues before he does! Then, to make Watson understand the mystery, Holmes has to explain it all, step by step. So we, the readers, get to see it step by step too. Watson is almost as good a character in the story as Sherlock Holmes! The very first time they meet, Holmes greatly surprises Watson. When they are first introduced, Holmes says to Watson, 'How do you do? I see you have been to Afghanistan .' Watson is too amazed by this to ask Holmes how he knows this. Watson has, indeed, been to Afghanistan. Later, he asks Holmes about it. Holmes explains that there is nothing magical about what he does. He gets to know it all by very, very careful observation . Observation One Watson was introduced to Holmes as a doctor. Yet Holmes thought that the way he stood and walked made him seem like a soldier. So, this meant he was probably an army doctor. Observation Two Watson's face was quite dark skinned. But his wrists were pale. So his dark face was probably sun burnt. This meant that he had been to a hot, sunny country. Observation Three At the time, the British army had soldiers at bases in many parts of the world. So there were still a lot of places to choose from. However, Holmes saw that Watson looked very tired and he was always holding his left arm, as if it was painful. So, he had probably been with the army to a place where they were fighting. There was only one place where the British army was fighting at that time: Afghanistan. Question: The writer most probably created the character, Dr Watson, to   _  . Answer: Available choices: (A). give Holmes help when solving mysteries. (B). show Holmes' careful observation. (C). help readers pick up some clues about the mystery. (D). get readers to see the mystery step by step.

Lash is associate dean at the University of Southern California Law School. Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.  Question: \\"Why did Katherine represent herself and not seek legal services?\\" Response: \\"She could not afford her own lawyer, and there are not enough legal aid lawyers to help everyone in need\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct. The paragraph explains that Katherine represented herself because she could not afford her own lawyer, and there's a shortage of legal aid lawyers in California, with only one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people.

However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral.

The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870 compelled Alma-Tadema to leave the continent and move to London. His infatuation with Laura Epps played a great part in his relocation to England and Gambart felt that the move would be advantageous to the artist's career. In stating his reasons for the move, Tadema simply said \\"I lost my first wife, a French lady with whom I married in 1863, in 1869. Having always had a great predilection for London, the only place where, up till then my work had met with buyers, I decided to leave the continent and go to settle in England, where I have found a true home.\\"  With his small daughters and sister Atje, Alma-Tadema arrived in London at the beginning of September 1870. The painter wasted no time in contacting Laura, and it was arranged that he would give her painting lessons. During one of these, he proposed marriage. As he was then thirty-four and Laura was now only eighteen, her father was initially opposed to the idea. Dr Epps finally agreed on the condition that they should wait until they knew each other better. They married in July 1871. Laura, under her married name, also won a high reputation as an artist, and appears in numerous of Alma-Tadema's canvases after their marriage (The Women of Amphissa (1887) being a notable example). This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence. Anna became a painter and Laurence became a novelist.

It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Anna continue answering the door? Options: - not enough information - Because Girolama threatened to disown her - Because she married Nicola - Because she liked Nicola The answer to this question is:","output":"Because she liked Nicola"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Lethal Weapon Context: Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Homicide Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), shortly after his 50th birthday, is partnered with Sergeant Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), a transfer from the Narcotics division. Riggs is a former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier who lost his wife in a car accident two years prior and has turned suicidal, and has been taking his anger out on suspects, leading to his superiors requesting his transfer. Murtaugh and Riggs quickly find themselves at odds with each other. Murtaugh is contacted by Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), an old Vietnam War buddy turned banker, but before they can meet, Murtaugh learns that Hunsaker's daughter, Amanda, apparently committed suicide by jumping to her death from her apartment balcony. Autopsy reports show Amanda to have been poisoned with drain cleaner, making the case a possible homicide. Hunsaker tells Murtaugh that he was worried about his daughter's involvement in drugs, prostitution, and hardcore pornography and was trying to get Murtaugh to help her escape that lifestyle. Murtaugh and Riggs go to see Amanda's pimp, but find a drug lab on the premises, leading to a shootout. Riggs kills the pimp and saves Murtaugh's life, who starts to gain respect for his new partner. Though the case seems closed, Riggs is worried that the only witness to Amanda's apparent suicide was Dixie, another prostitute who was working well outside her normal streets. They go to see her at her home but it explodes as they approach it. Riggs finds parts of a mercury switch from bomb debris, indicating a professional had set the bomb; children that had been nearby witnessed a man approach the house with a Special Forces tattoo similar to Riggs', and Murtaugh suspects Hunsaker knows more than he has let on. The two approach Hunsaker before Amanda's funeral, where he reveals that he had previously been part of \\"Shadow Company,\\" a heroin-smuggling operation run by former special forces operators from the Vietnam War, masterminded by retired General Peter McAllister... Answer:","output":"Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), a fellow LAPD officer and Roger Murtaugh's (Danny Glover) new partner, spends Christmas with the Murtaugh family in the movie \\"Lethal Weapon.\\" Despite their initial differences, Riggs and Murtaugh form a bond and develop a strong partnership throughout their investigations.

The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers.

Tourist flights are not allowed to places above Base Camp which is at an altitude of 5,364 metres (17,600ft). But helicopter companies say they only overfly sights like the Khumbu Icefall and their flights are allowed. There has been no expedition on Everest for the past two years because of a series of disasters. Sixteen Sherpas died on their way to Camp One in an icefall in 2014. At least 18 climbers died at Base Camp after a major earthquake triggered a huge avalanche last year. After the 2014 disaster, authorities moved the climbing route to the middle of the Khumbu Icefall. It is a treacherous section that mountaineers must cross on their way up to the summit of Everest. Sherpas are currently transporting expedition equipment to higher camps for the current climbing season. \\"The sightseeing helicopters are hovering above the Khumbu Icefall and making things difficult for us,\\" said Pasang Kaji Sherpa, a mountain guide with a military expedition team now on Everest. \\"We worry that the vibrations caused by helicopters can crack ice blocks and snow packs on mountains overlooking the Khumbu Icefall. \\"There is a deep-seated fear among Sherpa porters that they may be hit by avalanches this year as well and these helicopters are increasing fears,\\" Pasang Kaji Sherpa added. After the BBC started to investigate whether sightseeing helicopters were permitted to fly to places like the Khumbu Icefall, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) issued a circular to all airlines warning them not to conduct such flights. \\"We have made it clear in the circular that sightseeing flights are simply not allowed in places higher than the base camp,\\" said Rajan Pokhrel, Deputy Director General of CAAN. \\"Only rescue flights during emergencies are allowed in those areas and sometimes we allow special projects like skydiving when recommended by other government authorities.\\" Mr Pokhrel said his office had also heard the Sherpas' concerns. However, airline officials say there is no such danger. \\"We fly 2,340 feet from above the ground and maintain at least 1km distance from the mountains so there is no way the vibration can cause avalanche,\\" said Pabitra Karki, chairman of Airlines Operators Association Nepal (AOAN). \\"We use the French-made Ecureil helicopters for sightseeing which are very light and we carry two to three passengers in each flight.\\" AOAN officials say there are around half a dozen sightseeing flights per week during the climbing season. But other sources at Base Camp said such flights were becoming more frequent. About 20 helicopters are operated by six companies in Nepal but only a handful of pilots are qualified to fly to high altitudes. \\"For Sherpa climbers, especially those carrying equipment for expedition teams, helicopters flying overhead in higher areas is a mentally torturous experience,\\" says Phurba Namgyal Sherpa, general secretary of Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. \\"The fragile snow and ice conditions could be disturbed at any time by the rotors of helicopters and that could spell disaster for us. \\"This is an issue we have been discussing for quite some time now but we are not sure where to lodge the complaint.\\" Scaling Mount Everest is the dream of many climbers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to reach the summit Aviation experts say part of the problem is how such flights are policed by the authorities. Officials from CAAN admitted they were not on the ground to monitor such flights but relied on other government agencies based there. \\"Just because we are not there does not mean we don't get to know what happens up there,\\" Mr Pokhrel cautioned. In addition, the Department of Tourism has allowed helicopters to transport ropes and other gear up to Camp One to fix the route, after expedition operators complained that the earthquake had made the Khumbu Icefall more difficult to cross. \\"We fear that such a concession may be misused for more sightseeing and other commercial purposes and increase the risk of avalanche in the region,\\" said Phurba Namgyal Sherpa.","output":"Sherpa guides have raised concerns that tourist sightseeing helicopters over Everest Base Camp may be increasing the risk of avalanches by causing vibrations that could crack ice blocks and snow.

David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries.

Today, it is spoken by around 300 million people as a first or second language worldwide. French is an official language in 29 countries, including France, Canada (with both French and English as official languages), Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, and several countries in the African continent, such as Senegal, Mali, and Ivory Coast, among others. The text refers to two types of taxes found in Canada: the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The GST is a federal value-added tax levied on most goods and services sold in Canada. The HST is a combination of the GST and the provincial sales tax (PST), used in some provinces to simplify taxation. The memorandum of information is a document provided to potential investors or interested parties, describing a company's financial position, its core business, and general information about operations; in this case, it doesn't address the tax implications mentioned.

Given the below context:  The American Chemical Society (ACS) has used the Joseph Priestley House as a place to mark special celebrations. On July 31 and August 1, 1874, \\"seventy-seven chemists made a pilgrimage to the site to celebrate the centennial of chemistry\\". The date was chosen to mark the hundredth anniversary of Priestley's experiment producing oxygen by heating mercuric oxide with a magnifying lens and sunlight. These chemists came from 15 US states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and England, and their meeting at the house and a local school \\"is now recognized as the first National Chemistry Congress, and many ACS historians believe it led to ACS's formation two years later on April 6, 1876\\". On September 5, 1926, about 500 ACS members met again at the home to dedicate the small brick museum and to celebrate the meeting 50 years earlier (two survivors of that first meeting were present).Representatives of the ACS were present at the October 1970 dedication of the house as a museum. On April 25, 1974 around 400 chemists from the ACS Middle Atlantic Regional Meeting in Scranton came to visit the home. The Priestley Medal, the highest and oldest honor awarded by the ACS, was awarded to Paul Flory at the house that day. (A replica of the Priestley Medal is on display at the house.) On August 1, 1974—what has been labeled the bicentennial of the discovery of oxygen—over 500 chemists attending the third Biennial Conference on Chemical Education at State College traveled to the house to celebrate \\"Oxygen Day\\". In October 1976, the ACS celebrated its own centennial with a celebration in Northumberland. A 100-plus piece replica of Priestley's laboratory equipment, made by universities, corporations, and the Smithsonian Institution, was presented to the house for display. On April 13, 1983, ACS President Fred Basolo spoke at the house to celebrate Priestley's 250th birthday and as part of a first day of issue ceremony for the United States Postal Service's Joseph Priestley commemorative stamp.

Eric ignored the faith healers prognosis.; [B]. Logan ignored the faith healers prognosis.;","output":"As the two friends walked towards their destination, the conversation turned to the topic of alternative healing methods. Logan, a strong advocate for the natural and supernatural, avidly tried to persuade his friend about the power of crystals and their potential to heal. Eric, meanwhile, couldn't help but dismiss these ideas as mere nonsense, preferring to put his faith in established medical practices. A chance encounter with a wandering faith healer several weeks before was the source of the disagreement between Eric and Logan. A tall, mysterious figure with a warm, inviting aura, the healer had approached them with promises of wellness and balance. With one look at them, he claimed that he could sense a disrupted flow of energy within their bodies and had recommended they each take a session with him. Guided by his convictions, Logan eagerly accepted and had since then, mostly spoken in glowing terms when referring to his newfound inner peace. Eric, however, declined the faith healer's offer with a polite nod, maintaining his skepticism and rolling his eyes at Logan's anecdotes. Despite their opposing views, Eric and Logan were the best of friends. They always found immense joy in debating various topics, be it scientific, metaphysical, or social. They believed that the key to maintaining such a deep connection was rooted in their mutual respect for one another, regardless of their differing perspectives. While Logan maintained that the insights he experienced through the power of the crystals had dramatically improved his daily life, Eric couldn't help but attribute this improvement to the power of suggestion. The faith healer, as charismatic as he might have been, seemed to him as just another snake oil salesman peddling false hope to vulnerable souls searching for a higher truth. Contrarily, Logan was truly enraptured by the faith healer's wisdom and the possibilities that lay dormant within the crystals. Each session with him brought an unforeseen aspect of his existence bubbling to the surface, be it a harmonization of his body's energies, a connection to his higher self, or even a profound lucidity in his dreamscapes. For Logan, the faith healer was not someone to be ignored; he was a harbinger of a new era of understanding, of achieving the coveted state of spiritual equilibrium. The eventual roadmap to breaking the confines of social conditioning and fostering deep, meaningful connections with others. And so, as the two wandered through a sunlit glade, the pair continued their discourse. Friends by circumstance, yet showcasing the epitome of the inquisitive human spirit. To them, it was not about who was right or wrong, but the discovery and expansion of their horizons. In the end, it remained the ever-pervading enigma of existence - the quest to understand that which lay beyond the visible realm. For Eric and Logan, their contrasting beliefs only served to strengthen the unbreakable bond they shared. A bond that transcended their individual views and created an indomitable partnership fueled by curiosity and the thirst for understanding."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As Grace grapples with the constant strain of her son's illness, she must also navigate financial instability, societal judgment, and relationships, all while ultimately discovering her own strength and resilience.  Synopsis: Grace is a strong-willed, single mother living in a small town. Life has been difficult after the sudden passing of her loving husband, Chris, which leaves her with mounting bills and the responsibility of raising their eight-year-old son, Ethan. Ethan is diagnosed with a rare, chronic illness that requires continuous care, vigilance, and expensive treatments. The mother's struggle is highlighted as she tirelessly cares for her fragile son while facing overwhelming challenges. As the sole breadwinner, she works multiple jobs just to make ends meet and cover the costly healthcare bills, all the while ensuring Ethan gets the best possible care. Grace is often exhausted, which adds to the physical and emotional effort needed to manage a family in dire circumstances. Grace then meets Daniel, a caring and understanding doctor whose expertise has been invaluable in Ethan's treatment. An emotional bond forms between Grace and Daniel, but because of the growing gossip and judgment of the small-town community, Grace faces additional challenges. She is torn between seeking happiness in a world that seems to be against her every move and prioritizing her son's needs. To make matters worse, Grace's sister, Susan, offers financial help, but with it comes a price—she questions Grace's ability to continue caring for her son and suggests sending Ethan to a specialized care facility. This proposal triggers an internal conflict for Grace, who is confronted by her love for Ethan and the reality of their circumstances. As Ethan's condition gradually worsens, Grace begins learning more about his disease, connecting with other families facing similar struggles, and advocating for better healthcare options. Eventually, she finds solace and support in a close-knit online community of parents dealing with chronically ill children, creating a network that provides emotional, educational, and financial assistance, solidifying her resolve to fight through every obstacle. As a culmination of emotion, Grace takes one last shot at seeking alternative treatment approaches. With Daniel's help, they manage to enroll Ethan in an experimental treatment program. Despite all the difficulties, Ethan's resilience inspires Grace to take unfathomable risks and fight for her family, demonstrating her indomitable spirit and love for her son. In the emotional climax, after surmounting countless obstacles, Ethan begins to show small, steady improvements. As a result, Grace is brought to the realization that both the struggles and triumphs that life brings are only temporary, and they must embrace the storm together as a family. Embracing the Storm is a heart-wrenching yet inspiring movie focusing on a mother's love and the obstacles faced in caring for a chronically ill child. Through tears, laughter, and the human will to survive, Grace discovers the fierce warrior within, proving that a mother's strength holds no bounds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: A ‘Jail’ for Children Stirs a Ruckus in Brooklyn Playground controversies usually involve bickering parents, unruly dogs or bullies. One exception is at the Tompkins Houses, a city housing project in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where an orange jungle gym adorned with the word “Jail,” a cell door and prison bars has, six years after its installation, set off outrage in the neighborhood and the blogosphere, along with a hasty official response. Children may play cops and robbers all the time, but putting a pretend jail in a public housing playground in a historically black community struck some residents as an insult. “We started complaining because it was like promoting kids to go to jail,” said Natasha Godley, 37, who has a 6-year-old son. The prison look, including the offending word, was part of the original design of the playground, which was made by a company called Landscape Structures and erected in March 2004, the New York City Housing Authority said on Wednesday. But it had not elicited complaints until this week, said Sheila Stainback, an agency spokeswoman. Lumumba Bandele, a lecturer in black history at the City University of New York who lives nearby, said he began complaining to the housing authority and local officials about the playground this past weekend. “The fact is that this community along with six others in New York City makes up the majority of the prison population in New York State,” he said. “And to have this here under the auspices of NYCHA is absolutely insulting.” The jungle gym, tucked behind a building near Throop and Park Avenues, sits across from a handball court adorned with paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. On Sunday, the Web site Black and Brown News published a photo of the jungle gym by Mr. Bandele’s wife, Monifa Bandele, accompanying a critical article about it. “There is no kind, gentle, diplomatic way to describe the offense against a community by this ‘Jail Playground’ on a New York City Housing Authority property,” the article began. Some residents said that complaints about the play set were actually not a new phenomenon. One Housing Authority grounds worker who declined to give her name said that her mother was so incensed about the inscription that, two years ago, she marched over to the play set and covered the word “Jail” with gold spray paint. It was not clear how the word came to be restored. But on Wednesday after the Black and Brown News article was picked up by Brownstoner and other sites, Housing Authority workers arrived to paint over the “Jail.” Later, another worker showed up in painter’s pants and began scouring off the word “Jail” and the fake bars, which appeared stenciled into the play set, with steel wool and paint remover. The authority, Ms. Stainback said, “painted over the equipment as a temporary solution to replacing this part of the playground.” The authority is also looking into who ordered the equipment. Calls to the main office of Landscape Structures were not returned. A woman who answered the phone at one of its sales offices, in Carle Place on Long Island, said the company provides playgrounds for the Housing Authority, “but only by their approval.” She said she had never seen one of the company’s play sets adorned with the word “jail,” but emphasized, “I’m only answering the phones.” Somewhere in the city’s public housing universe, the playground has a twin, Ms. Stainback said. She would not divulge its location, but said that its “Jail” sign and bars would be painted over, too. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about a playground in Brooklyn, called Tompkins Houses, that has a jungle gym with the word \\"Jail\\" and prison bars on it.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Problem:Passage: In the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992), pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the \\"looking glass\\" that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. Retzinger (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on Goffman and Cooley's work, Scheff (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.

They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - The Temple of Elemental Evil is a 2003 role - playing video game by Troika Games . It is a remake of the classic Dungeons & Dragons adventure of the same title using the 3.5 edition rules . This is the only video game to take place in the Greyhawk campaign setting , and the first video game to implement the 3.5 edition rule set . The game was published by Atari , who then held the interactive rights of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise . The Temple of Elemental Evil was released in autumn of 2003 and was criticized for stability issues and other bugs . The turn - based tactical combat , however , was generally thought to be implemented well , and is arguably the most faithful representation of the then - current tabletop role - playing game ( \`\` 3.5e '' ) rules in a video game .  - Troika Games was a video game developer co-founded by Jason Anderson, Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky. The company was focused on role-playing video games between 1998 and 2005, best known for \\"\\" and \\"\\".  - Atari Interactive is a name used by several separate groups and corporations since the mid-1990s. In 1996, it was the name of Atari Corporation's PC publishing division, bringing games like the Atari Jaguar's \\"Tempest 2000\\" to the PC platform. From 1998 to 2001, Atari Interactive, Inc. was the name of the corporate entity that held the Atari properties purchased from JTS by Hasbro in 1998, and functioned as the retro publishing subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive. It is currently the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari, SA (formerly Infogrames), who is the current owner of the Atari brand and various other properties formerly belonging to Hasbro Interactive. It was formed in 2001, when IESA acquired Hasbro Interactive and proceeded to rename it to Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive, Inc. as part of its worldwide reorganization to focus on use of the Atari brand.  - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview.  - Tim Cain is an American video game developer best known as the producer, lead programmer and one of the main designers of the 1997 computer game \\"Fallout\\".

The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Leonard Boyarsky is an American computer game designer and visual artist best known for being one of the key designers of the video games \\"Fallout\\" and \\"Diablo III\\".  - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983.  - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign.  - Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American electrical engineer and businessman. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \\"Newsweek\\"s \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry.

Monroe flies in via floatplane and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel. After several days of trekking through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group initially meets hostility and learns that the film team had caused great unrest among the people. The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ and the Shamatari.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who was in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band?  After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City. Their immediate task was to record a hit single as the follow-up to \\"Positively 4th Street\\", but Dylan was already shaping his next album, the third one that year backed by rock musicians.

Information:  - A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation. The first boy bands consisted of the Beatles, Jackson 5, the Monkees, and the Osmonds singing love songs marketed towards young females. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.  - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career  a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers.  - Simon Solomon Webbe ( born 30 March 1978 ) is an English singer - songwriter , actor and music manager . He is best known as a member of the British boy band Blue , forming in 2000 before splitting in 2005 and reforming in 2009 , selling over 15 million records . Webbe released two solo studio albums in 2005 and 2006 , sold over 700,000 records worldwide and had five UK Top 40 singles .  - A misnomer is a word or term that suggests a meaning that is known to be wrong. Misnomers often arise because the thing received its name long before its true nature was known, or because the nature of an earlier form is no longer the norm. A misnomer may also be simply a word that is used incorrectly or misleadingly. \\"Misnomer\\" does not mean \\"misunderstanding\\" or \\"popular misconception\\", and many misnomers remain in legitimate use (that is, being a misnomer does not always make a name incorrect).  - The Monkees are an American-British pop rock band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series \\"The Monkees\\", which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner.    What is the relationship between 'simon webbe' and 'pop'?

As I watch the breathtaking sunset and reminisce on my shallow falls or \\"drunken cat in a washing machine\\" moments, it's heartening to know that my stay here is contributing to a greater cause.

Many of them express immense gratitude for the education, healthcare, and employment opportunities provided to them and their children. It's incredible how a single resort and foundation can generate such positive change in a community. This makes my vacation feel not only rewarding for the relaxation and rejuvenation it brings but also for the impact it leaves on this beautiful island. So, as I nurse my bruised ego from the challenges of surfing, I am reminded that there is so much more to take away from my time spent in Nihiwatu now - my support, in any form, is helping the Sumba Foundation make a difference in the lives of the locals.

Imagine you have a really big jar with lots of colorful balls in it. You take out a certain number of balls (268418*c) and then put more balls back in (536853*c), and finally, take out some more balls (268194*c). At the end, you have 13496 colorful balls left in the jar. Now, we want to find out the value of 'c' which represents how many balls you are taking out and putting back in. So, here's what we're going to do: 1. Combine the number of balls taken out and put back in, like this:    536853*c - 268418*c - 268194*c 2. Now, simplify it to:    (536853 - 268418 - 268194)*c 3. Do the math inside the parentheses:    536853 - 268418 - 268194 = 241 4. So, now it looks like this:    241*c = 13496 5. To find the value of 'c', we'll divide both sides of the equation by 241:    c = 13496 / 241 6. When you do that division, you get:    c = 56 So, our answer is c = 56.

Q:Information:  - A parody religion or mock religion is a belief system that challenges spiritual convictions of others, often through humor, satire, or burlesque (literary ridicule). Often created to achieve a specific purpose related to another belief system, a parody religion can be a parody of several religions, sects, gurus, cults, or new religious movements at the same time or even a parody of no particular religion, instead parodying the concept of religious belief itself. In some parody religions, emphasis is on having fun and being a convenient excuse for pleasant social interaction among the like-minded (e.g., the Church of the SubGenius). Other parody religions target a specific religion, sect, cult, or new religious movement.  - In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving.  - Monotheism has been defined as the belief in the existence of only one god that created the world, is all-powerful and interferes in the world. Another, more broad definition of monotheism, is the belief in one god. A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, and both inclusive monotheism and pluriform (panentheistic) monotheism which, while recognising various distinct gods, postulate some underlying unity.  - Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society. It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature. Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position. He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe. The state dedicated enormous resources to Egyptian rituals and to the construction of the temples.  - Omnipresence or ubiquity is the property of being present everywhere. This property is most commonly used in a religious context as an attribute of a deity or supreme being.   - Ra (\\"R\\") or Re (\\"R\\") is the ancient Egyptian sun god. By the Fifth Dynasty in the 25th and 24th centuries , he had become a major god in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun.  - In theology, the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is without parts. The general idea of divine simplicity can be stated in this way: the being of God is identical to the \\"attributes\\" of God. In other words, such characteristics as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical to God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities inhering in God as in a substance. Varieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of scholasticism, though the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' \\"Enneads\\" as the Simplex.  - Omniscience , mainly in religion, is the capacity to know everything that there is to know. In particular, Dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism) and the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) believe that there is a divine being who is omniscient. An omniscient point-of-view, in writing, is to know everything that can be known about a character, including past history, thoughts, feelings, etc. In Latin, \\"omnis\\" means \\"all\\" and \\"science\\" means \\"knowing\\".  - Omnipotence is the quality of having unlimited power. Monotheistic religions generally attribute omnipotence to only the deity of their faith. In the monotheistic philosophies of Abrahamic religions, omnipotence is often listed as one of a deity's characteristics among many, including omniscience, omnipresence, and omnibenevolence. The presence of all these properties in a single entity has given rise to considerable theological debate, prominently including the problem of theodicy, the question of why such a deity would permit the manifestation of evil.  - Supreme Being is a term for God used by theologians and philosophers of many religious faiths, including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and deism.  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"  - The Church of the SubGenius is a parody religion that satirizes better-known belief systems. It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on J. R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs, purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church. SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies. Their central deity, Jehovah 1, is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient mythology and popular fiction. SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs' followers. In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources.  - Jehovah 1 or JHVH - 1 ( also known as Woden , Ra , etc. ) is a God - like entity important in the mythology of the Church of the SubGenius , and the opposite number of the Satan - like entity NHGH . This \`\` wrathful alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy '' is considered to be identical with the God of the Abrahamic and most other patriarchal religions . According to SubGenius dogma , JHVH - 1 contacted J. R. \`\` Bob '' Dobbs in 1953 through a television set of Dobbs ' own construction . The many things told and shown to \`\` Bob '' during his Divine Emaculation were written down in the Prescriptures , the most sacred texts of SubGenius tradition , excerpts of which were publicized in the Book of the SubGenius .  - Theism, in the field of comparative religion, or when contrasted with atheism, is broadly defined as the belief in the existence of a deity or deities. In popular parlance, or when contrasted with \\"deism\\", the term often describes the classical conception of god(s) that is found in the monotheistic and polytheistic religions; a belief in a god or in gods without the rejection of revelation as is characteristic of deism.   - Simplicity is the state or quality of being simple. Something which is easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label \\"simplicity\\" can imply beauty, purity, or clarity. \\"Simplicity\\" may also occur with negative connotations to suggest a deficit or insufficiency of nuance or of complexity of a thing, relative to what one supposes as required.  - Noon (also midday or noon time) is usually defined as 12 o'clock in the daytime, that is, 12 in the afternoon or 12p.m. The term midday is also used colloquially to refer to an arbitrary period of time in the middle of the day. Solar noon is when the sun crosses the meridian and is at its highest elevation in the sky, at 12 o'clock apparent solar time. The local or clock time of solar noon depends on the longitude and date. The opposite of noon is midnight.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'jehovah 1'.  Choices: - 1  - 12  - attribute  - buddhism  - christian  - christianity  - church  - clock  - complex  - definition  - deity  - doctrine  - dynasty  - elevation  - ethics  - faith  - field  - god  - history  - idea  - integral  - islam  - king  - may  - monotheism  - muslim  - mythology  - new religious movement  - object  - order  - parody  - parody religion  - part  - point  - property  - quality  - religion  - science  - society  - state  - supernatural  - system  - term  - theology  - time  - truth  - writing A:","output":"god"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to genetic factors, research has shown that certain metabolic alterations can also play significant roles in cancer initiation, growth, and spread. Here are four other key factors associated with cancer as a metabolic disorder: 1) Glutamine, 2) Insulin, 3) Glycation Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs), and 4) Sugar Levels.  1. Glutamine: Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the bloodstream and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, energy generation, and regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Cancer cells often have an increased demand for glutamine, relying on it as a major fuel source to support rapid cell division. By consuming high amounts of glutamine, cancer cells can outcompete healthy cells for resources and proliferate further. Several therapies are in development to target glutamine metabolism to starve cancer cells of this essential nutrient, with the ultimate goal of slowing or stopping tumor growth. 2. Insulin: Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose metabolism, playing a pivotal role in maintaining blood sugar levels within normal parameters. Recent research has revealed a strong link between elevated insulin levels and cancer development. High insulin levels can promote cancer cell growth by increasing the availability of glucose and other nutrients in the bloodstream. Additionally, insulin can activate signaling pathways that lead to cell division, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. As a result, it may indirectly promote tumor progression. Therefore, understanding the relationship between insulin and cancer may lead to the development of new targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies in the future. 3. Glycation Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): AGEs are formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between sugar molecules and proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids, leading to the formation of large, complex molecular structures. They accumulate within cells and tissues over time and are implicated in several age-related and lifestyle-related diseases, including cancer. AGEs can promote cancer development and progression through various mechanisms, including the activation of signaling pathways, the promotion of inflammation and oxidative stress, and the stimulation of angiogenesis. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that some types of cancer cells have a higher sensitivity to AGEs, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. 4. Sugar Levels: High sugar consumption has been associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly in those with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. Elevated blood sugar levels can contribute to cancer development through several mechanisms, including the stimulation of insulin secretion, the generation of oxidative stress and inflammation, and the direct cellular damage caused by excessive glucose metabolism. In addition, high sugar levels can favor cancer cell proliferation by providing a constant source of energy. Therefore, maintaining a healthy diet low in sugar content and managing blood sugar levels through lifestyle modifications and medical interventions may help prevent the development and progression of cancer. In conclusion, understanding and exploring the connections between cancer as a metabolic disorder and these four key factors (glutamine, insulin, AGEs, and sugar levels) provides valuable insights into cancer initiation, progression, and potential therapeutic targets. Targeting metabolic processes and pathways associated with these factors may offer novel opportunities for cancer prevention and treatment, improving patient outcomes and reducing cancer-related morbidity and mortality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vincent wanted to boil water for the spaghetti in a kettle instead of a pot because he thought the","output":"water would heat up faster in the kettle. You see, a kettle is a special container that is used to heat water quickly, and it can heat water faster than a pot because it has a smaller opening at the top, which helps keep the heat inside. So, Vincent filled the kettle with water and turned on the heat. As the water started to get warm, it began to make a funny whistling sound. That's because kettles have a special part called a whistle that lets out a loud sound when the water inside is boiling and ready to be used. This helps people know when their water is hot and ready, just like an alarm clock helps us know when it's time to wake up. Once the kettle started whistling, Vincent knew the water was boiling and ready for the spaghetti. He carefully took the kettle off the stove and poured the hot water into a larger pot. Then, he added the long, thin spaghetti noodles into the pot, making sure they were covered by the hot water.  Spaghetti is a type of pasta, and pasta comes from a country called Italy. Italian people love to eat pasta with different sauces and ingredients, like tomatoes, cheese, and even meatballs. Vincent wanted to have his spaghetti with a tomato sauce and some grated cheese on top- yum! As the spaghetti noodles cooked in the boiling water, they became soft and flexible. Vincent used a big fork to stir the noodles so they wouldn't stick together. Once the spaghetti was cooked just right, he carefully drained the water out of the pot, using a colander. A colander is like a big bowl with lots of tiny holes in it; it lets the water out but keeps the spaghetti inside. Now it was time to add the tomato sauce! Vincent poured the sauce over the warm spaghetti noodles and mixed it all together. He then grabbed a plate, put some spaghetti on it, and sprinkled some cheese on top. Vincent finally took a big bite of his delicious spaghetti dinner, feeling proud and happy that he was able to make it by using the kettle to heat the water. It just goes to show that sometimes, thinking creatively and trying new ways of doing things can lead to a yummy and satisfying result!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy.

One day when he was a teenager, Eisenheim (played as young man by Aaron Johnson) meets a traveling magician (David Forest) along a road. The magician performs several tricks for him and then, according to various accounts, both the magician and the tree he was sitting under vanish. Eisenheim becomes obsessed with magic tricks after this.He also falls in love with Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen (Biel, played as a young lady by Eleanor Tomlinson ), a noblewoman well above his social class; her parents have hired Eisenheim's father as a cabinetmaker. Young Eisenheim makes Young Sophie a unique marquetry puzzle locket, which if twisted correctly reveals a small, hidden photograph of Eisenheim. Although the two are forbidden to see each other, they meet in a secret hideout chamber in the woods, where Eisenheim tells of his plans to go to China to learn more magic and Sophie promises to go with him. On the day that they are going to leave, however, the police come looking for Sophie. The two hide in the secret room and Sophie begs Eisenheim to make them both disappear. He is unable to fulfill this request and the two are separated.Eisenheim leaves his village to travel the world; he perfects his magic and returns 15 years later as a master illusionist. He meets Sophie at one of his performances, when she is volunteered by the ruthless Crown Prince Leopold as a reluctant participant in a trick.

Eisenheim and Sophie, having recognized each other, meet privately, whereupon it is revealed that Sophie still has the locket he made for her years ago. After... Answer:","output":"Considering the detailed plot summary provided for the movie, a comprehensive and thought-provoking question to ask would be: How does Eisenheim's journey from a humble cabinetmaker's son to a master illusionist, and his enduring love for Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen, not only challenge and change the societal norms and beliefs of their time, but also how does it ultimately expose and break the cycle of power and abuse exerted by Crown Prince Leopold, eventually allowing Eisenheim and Sophie to shape their destinies? This question brings together various elements of the plot, such as Eisenheim's dedication to honing his magical skills, his relationship with Sophie that transcends social class boundaries, and their struggle against the oppressive force represented by Crown Prince Leopold. Additionally, it invites an analysis of the characters’ motivations, the impact of their choices and actions, and the transformative potential of love and determination in the face of adversity.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Q: run around right thrice A:","output":"To break down the command \\"run around right thrice\\", we'll first identify the key words and then translate them into actions based on the definition provided: 1. \\"run\\" - corresponds to the action 'I_RUN'. 2. \\"around\\" - means to execute the action while turning around in the specified direction. 3. \\"right\\" - indicates the direction for the \\"around\\" command, which means turning right. 4. \\"thrice\\" - indicates the command sequence should be repeated three times. Knowing this information, we can construct the sequence of actions: 1. 'I_RUN' - perform the running action. 2. 'I_TURN_RIGHT' - since we need to \\"run around right\\", we start by turning right. 3. 'I_RUN' - continue running after turning. 4. 'I_TURN_RIGHT' - turning right again to complete the around right movement. 5. 'I_RUN' - continue running after completing the around right movement. Now, we need to repeat this sequence thrice: 1. 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN' (first repetition) 2. 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN' (second repetition) 3. 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN' (third repetition) Combining these sequences gives us the final output: 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN'"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process In the given process, it primarily describes the respiratory system and how air is taken in, oxygen is exchanged, and carbon dioxide is exhaled. When considering the scenario of \\"more reservations made\\" happening, we can assume this refers to an increase in physical or mental activities that require more energy and oxygen consumption. When more reservations are made, it means that there is an increased demand for oxygen by the body to support the additional activities. As a result, the body will likely increase the rate of respiration to accommodate this higher demand for oxygen, leading to more air being taken in via the nose or mouth. This increase in the rate of respiration and air intake is an indirect effect on the process, as it is not directly modifying a specific step in the process. However, it is still impacting the process by altering the overall respiratory rate to meet the body's increased demand for oxygen. In summary, the supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. The increased demand for oxygen due to more reservations made will cause the body to adjust its respiratory rate and increase the amount of air taken in through the nose or mouth, which indirectly affects the overall respiratory process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's convicted killer, is up for parole for the seventh time and may be questioned as early as Tuesday, authorities said Friday. His latest quest for freedom comes ahead of the 32nd anniversary of the death of the former Beatle, a British singer-songwriter who was gunned down outside his Manhattan apartment on December 8, 1980. Chapman is scheduled to be interviewed by two or three members of the parole board, according to Carole Claren-Weaver, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of Corrections. Chapman's words on the slaying. He was last up for parole in 2010, but was denied because his \\"discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,\\" according to the New York State Division of Parole. He was also denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Chapman, 57, is serving a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, and is being held at the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York. He is in protective custody in a single-person cell, Claren-Weaver said, and is allowed out three hours per day. Since his transfer from Attica earlier this year, Chapman has reapplied to participate in a state program called \\"family reunion,\\" which allows inmates to spend more time with family members. Chapman has not had an infraction since 1994. It is not clear if he currently has legal representation.

Mark wants to leave early, and this is called \\"parole.\\"  Now, the people in charge are talking to him to see if they will let him leave early or not. This is not the first time they have talked to him about this, but they have always said no before. He has to stay in prison, and follow the rules, just like you would with your parents at home.

Drink at least 4-5 glasses of water a day to keep your skin looking and feeling great. You’re much less likely to chafe in the future if you stay well hydrated. If you get sick of boring old water, add a slice of lime or lemon to the water! Keep the temperature in your home cool enough so that you aren’t sweating. Avoid going out if it’s extremely hot outside. When you do sweat, brush the area gently with a dry, clean cloth. Avoiding sweat and keeping your skin dry is a great way to prevent chafing.  If your skin is so dry that it’s uncomfortable, use a cream or lotion to add some healthy moisture. Sweat can make chafing worse because it is relatively high in minerals that can irritate the skin even further. After sweating, remove your clothes, rinse off in the shower, and dry your skin completely. You have a higher chance of getting chafed skin if you’re overweight, especially when it comes to the thighs. Exercise regularly and eat a balanced diet of grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. The best way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you are consuming, so limit portion size and move around as much as possible.  Aim to eat healthy, well-balanced meals and avoid the fast food and sugary drinks. If you do drink a ton of sugary drinks, replacing soda and sports drinks with water is a great way to shed a little weight without breaking out the exercise equipment.

A female ape (Terry Notary), designated No. 9 and known as \\"Bright Eyes\\" by the staff, has been given the drug ALZ 112, and has shown considerable progress. She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... Question: Following the summit, what does Trump likely believe about North Korea's intent to honor the new agreement? Options: - not enough information   - that the agreement will definitely be broken at some point   - probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations   - that the agreement will not likely bear meaningful results === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations. The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un marked an unprecedented meeting between the two nations. Following the summit, both leaders signed a broad declaration aiming to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long-standing hostilities between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement \\"very comprehensive.\\" Given the positive outcome of the summit and the historic nature of the meeting, it is likely that Trump believes North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations. This belief may be further bolstered by the fact that North Korea pivoted to diplomacy after successfully testing missiles that it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States. Additionally, North Korea suspended further provocations and indicated a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. It is important to note, however, that some skepticism still exists among South Koreans and others. This is due to North Korea's history of not keeping its promises in the past, even after signing agreements. While there are differing opinions on the likelihood of success for the new agreement, it is probable that Trump believes that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How do you do this: How do you remove red wine stains from furniture?","output":"To remove red wine stains from furniture, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Act Quickly Red wine stains are easier to remove when they are fresh. As soon as you notice the spill, act quickly to minimize the chance of the stain setting in. Step 2: Blot the Stain Using a clean, white cloth or paper towel, gently blot the stain to absorb as much liquid as possible. Do not rub the stain, as this can cause it to spread or settle deeper into the fibers. Step 3: Mix a Cleaning Solution Create a cleaning solution by mixing two cups of cool water with one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Alternatively, you can use white vinegar instead of dish soap, which can help neutralize the stain more effectively. Step 4: Test the Solution Before applying the cleaning solution to the stain, test it on an inconspicuous area of the furniture to ensure it won't damage or discolor the fabric. Step 5: Apply the Cleaning Solution Dip a clean, white cloth into the cleaning solution and gently blot the stain until it becomes damp. Avoid soaking the fabric as this can cause damage to the furniture. Step 6: Blot with a Clean Cloth Using another clean, white cloth, gently blot the stained area to lift away the stain. Repeat this process, alternating between the cleaning solution and a clean cloth until the stain is no longer visible. Step 7: Rinse the Area Using a new cloth dampened with cold water, gently blot the area to rinse away any soap residue. Step 8: Dry the Area Gently press a clean, dry cloth or paper towel against the area to absorb excess moisture. Allow the fabric to air dry completely. Remember that some fabrics and stains may be more difficult to remove than others, and professional cleaning may be necessary if the stain persists. Always consult the care instructions for your specific furniture to ensure you are using the appropriate cleaning method."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:At the European Respiratory Society conference, researchers will suggest this could be due to an absence of protective fatty acids in yoghurt. The diets of more than 70,000 Danish women were analysed and their children followed until the age of seven. Asthma UK says pregnant women should follow a balanced diet. Pregnant women who ate low-fat yoghurt with fruit once a day were found to be 1.6 times more likely to have children who developed asthma by age seven, compared with children of women who did not eat low-fat yoghurt. The study also found that the children of these women were more likely to have allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and current asthma symptoms. But the results showed that milk intake during pregnancy was not linked to any increased risk of asthma. In fact, milk was shown to protect against asthma development. Ekaterina Maslova, lead study author form the Harvard School of Public Health, who worked with the data at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, said: \\"It is a puzzling finding. The absence of fatty acids in low-fat yoghurt may be key to the results. \\"The results suggest that fatty acids play an important role or it could be that people who ate this kind of yoghurt had similar lifestyle and dietary patterns, but we cannot make any conclusions at this stage. \\"We need to replicate these results in other studies first.\\" Leanne Metcalf, director of research at Asthma UK, said there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the pre-natal environment can influence a child's health. \\"However, the impact of a pregnant woman's diet on her child's health continues to be debated, as it is difficult to assess how particular aspects of a woman's diet during pregnancy are linked to the risk of developing asthma and allergies. \\"Eating a healthy, balanced diet at any time, but especially during pregnancy is advisable and we would recommend that pregnant women discuss any drastic changes to their diet with their GP first.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses a study that analyzed the diets of over 70,000 Danish women during pregnancy and followed their children until the age of seven.

This field is generated by the movement of molten iron within the Earth's core. The Earth's magnetic field has two poles: the magnetic north pole and the magnetic south pole. Step 1: Understanding the compass A compass is an instrument containing a small magnet (the needle) that is free to pivot and align itself with the Earth's magnetic field. One end of the needle is typically painted red or marked with an \\"N\\" to indicate the north-seeking end. Step 2: Align the compass When you hold the compass horizontally and allow the needle to move freely, it will line up with the Earth's magnetic field lines, with the north-seeking end of the needle pointing toward the magnetic north pole. Step 3: Magnetic declination It is important to note that the Earth's magnetic north pole is not exactly the same as the geographic north pole. The angle between the magnetic north and true north is called magnetic declination, and it can vary depending on your location on Earth. To obtain the true north direction requires adjusting for the local magnetic declination. So, when the needle of a compass lines up with Earth's magnetic poles, the needle points towards the magnetic north pole and is aligned with the Earth's magnetic field lines. In summary, when the needle of a compass lines up with Earth's magnetic poles, the needle is: 1. Aligned with the Earth's magnetic field lines. 2. Pointing toward the magnetic north pole. 3. Indicating the magnetic north direction, which may differ from the true north depending on the local magnetic declination."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trust me I'm a doctor: the case of the rogue spinal surgeon It didn’t take long for Richard Kaul’s spine surgery practice in the middle-class New Jersey suburb of Pompton Lakes to turn a profit. The Indian-born, British-raised doctor had been performing procedures in small surgeries for a number of years before he opened his own place in 2011. By 2012, he owned a 2m home in New Jersey, a Manhattan penthouse and an 8.3m brownstone on New York’s Upper West Side, which boasted a soundproof media room, three terraces and nine fireplaces. Kaul’s website attributed his success to his brilliance as a surgeon. He had, it said, “long been lauded as a pioneer in minimally invasive spine surgery” and had “performed the first outpatient spinal fusion in New Jersey”. His medical training was “as extensive as it is impressive”: he had graduated from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in London in 1988 and trained in both the UK and US. It was armed with this information, and desperate for help, that James Jarrell first visited Kaul. He had experienced sporadic back pain for more than 20 years – half his working life had been spent in the drilling and blasting industry. For a year, he’d received cortisone shots, spinal manipulation and anaesthesia from a chiropractor, but eventually, on 5 September 2005, he was referred to Kaul. Kaul told him he would perform minimally invasive spinal surgery – he’d “make a cut down in the side and… put two very small holes where they can work through some tubes,” Jarrell later recalled in court – and that he’d be back at work within two weeks. Kaul performed a discogram, injecting dye into the spinal discs to pinpoint the cause of the pain; a discectomy, removing disc material that was pressing on the nerves or spinal cord; a lumbar interbody fusion, in which two mesh cages were implanted between the spinal discs; and the insertion of pedicle screws – bone screws used to secure rods and plates to support the spine. When he awoke in the recovery room, Jarrell’s right side felt better, but his left side was in agony: “I remember touching and complaining about my left leg which had never bothered me before.” He had difficulty moving it, and walking on it hurt. When he got the x-rays back, Jarrell was told to return to the doctor immediately. “They would not tell me what was wrong. I remember thinking, am I crippled? I was very upset. I was scared.” Jarrell went back to see Kaul. “He just flipped the x-rays up to the light and said, ‘Oh, we can fix this: I just go up in there and scrape a little stuff out, and you’ll be fine.’ And I said no, no, no. No, you’re not touching me.” A different doctor prescribed oxycodone and fentanyl patches for the pain. Jarrell was forced to wear a back and foot brace, but by March 2007 the pain was worsening and he developed depression. He sought treatment from a neurosurgeon who found that the implant material Kaul had installed was pinching a nerve; he also thought the screws had been misplaced. Jarrell underwent further surgery, after which he said he felt much better, but his ability to walk had been impaired. Jarrell sued Kaul and his practice for medical malpractice – his wife Sheila claimed she had lost her husband’s “companionship, consortium and services”, while Jarrell claimed he was left unable to walk properly or work because of the pain. The jury found that Kaul had deviated from the applicable standard of care and awarded Jarrell 500,000 for “pain, suffering, disability and the loss of the enjoyment of life” and 187,890 for medical expenses; Sheila got 250,000. But it transpired that Jarrell wasn’t alone: he was one of 11 patients who claim to have been left injured after being operated on by Kaul. One, Patricia Maze, accused him of leaving her disabled after surgery on her lower back in 2008. Her attorney said Kaul attempted to perform a spinal fusion and that the result was permanent damage to her spine, which left her wheelchair-bound and in a “living hell”. Kaul settled with Maze in March for a reported 450,000, just before her case went to trial. Kaul was found to have been grossly negligent and incompetent in those 11 cases; it also turned out that he wasn’t a qualified spine surgeon at all – he was a doctor, yes, but an anaesthetist. Worse than that, he had a conviction for manslaughter in the UK. In 2001, a dental patient Kaul had anaesthetised died during routine treatment, and Kaul received a suspended prison sentence. He had neglected to tell the New Jersey medical board this – something he was required to do when he renewed his licence there, having been banned from practising medicine in Britain. I wanted to know what Kaul was doing now. Was he remorseful? Did he accept the court and medical board’s findings – and would he talk to me? Born in Hyderabad in southern India, Richard Kaul moved to the UK when he was two and the family settled in Kent. He graduated from London’s Royal Free hospital in 1988 and worked there and at the Lister hospital in Chelsea, before moving to the US in the 90s. After a handful of surgical internships in New York, Kaul began a three-year fellowship in anaesthesia in New Jersey, and was board certified by the American Medical Association in 1996. Visa restrictions meant he had to return to the UK for two years, where he undertook a one-year fellowship in pain management at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. He applied to the Royal College of Surgeons to get his American certification recognised in Britain, but it ruled that he would have to train for a further 18 months in a British hospital – a decision Kaul challenged but one that was upheld on appeal. Instead, with financial help from his brother, he purchased a dental clinic in Dalston, east London. In March 1999, Isatu Bangura, 56, came in for a routine tooth extraction and two fillings, but the mother of six was anxious and asked for a general anaesthetic. Kaul gave her the sedative midazolam and the analgesic fentanyl. When the dentist began, Kaul later recalled, it became evident Bangura could still feel pain, so he gave her a dose of the barbiturate methohexital. What happened next formed the basis of a court case at the Old Bailey in which Kaul answered a charge of manslaughter: Bangura’s heart stopped during the dental procedure and she died six days later. The court heard that a receptionist had acted as an unqualified dental nurse; she testified that Kaul had asked her to switch off an alarm monitoring Bangura’s blood pressure and oxygen level because the noise annoyed him. She also said he was looking out of the window and talking on his phone when she noticed Bangura wasn’t breathing – claims Kaul denied. William Boyce, prosecuting, said Kaul used “back door” methods not approved by the General Dental Council; that he administered anaesthetic too quickly or in too great a quantity. Kaul failed to call an ambulance for 30 minutes after Bangura stopped breathing, Boyce said, and refused to accompany her to hospital. In an 11-1 majority verdict, Kaul was found guilty and given a six-month suspended prison sentence. But Kaul still had his US anaesthesia accreditation and had no intention of quitting. He sent off an application form to renew his medical licence, on which he was asked if he’d ever been charged with a crime, or if his licence had ever been suspended. Kaul ticked no to both – a move he would later say he made because he believed it referred to crimes in the US, not the UK. It would be another year before the General Medical Council struck Kaul off its register, so for the time being he was still licensed to practise in the UK. He embarked on a business venture with his brother, Peter, taking telephone consultations from patients experiencing impotence issues and dispensing Viagra – then a new “wonder drug”. When Kaul moved back to the US in September 2001, Peter, who was not a doctor, continued to operate the business. Shortly after, officers from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency – the body responsible for ensuring the safety of medicines in the UK – raided the company’s offices and seized their computers. In New York, Kaul was visited by agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration and later received a summons to appear at court in London; but he told his brother that unless they extradited him, he was not returning. Peter was fined £200,000. Kaul claims he paid most of that sum himself – but that when the final court date arrived, the judge sent his brother to prison for a year – the amount hadn’t been paid in full. News of Kaul’s conviction for manslaughter and of the GMC hearing finally crossed the pond, and in 2002 he was told the New Jersey medical board intended to revoke his licence. It took a year for his licence hearing to come to court. Kaul argued that if Bangura’s death had happened in the US, it would have resulted in a malpractice suit, not a charge of manslaughter. But the board fined him 10,000 and suspended his licence for six months. Kaul later wrote that he wanted to use this time to acquire skills in minimally invasive spine surgery which he could see was a developing field. He travelled to South Korea to attend a two-week spine surgery course. When he returned to New York, with his medical licence reinstated, he worked in pain management treatment centres and began performing spinal surgery on patients. Maze and Jarrell were among 11 whose testimony was taken into consideration by the New Jersey state attorney general after a complaint was filed with the board of medical examiners. Their findings were damning. Kaul had performed spine surgeries for which he was not qualified, the report said: “There was nothing in his education or training that provided him with the experience necessary to perform spinal surgeries. In fact, the first time he ever inserted a pedicle screw on a live patient was at a surgery centre when he was on his own. There was no one to monitor the surgery or assess his skill level.” For claiming he was a minimally invasive spine specialist, and telling patients he had the skills to perform those surgeries, the report said he “engaged in dishonesty, fraud, deception [and] misrepresentation”. He also failed to maintain medical malpractice insurance. In March this year, the board revoked Kaul’s licence and fined him 300,000, ordering him to pay the state’s expenses of 174,000. But Kaul refused to accept this. He launched an audacious PR campaign, including a billboard in Times Square and a YouTube channel – the first video, entitled Exposing Lies, dealt with what he said was the inaccuracy of press coverage he had received. He set up a Facebook page, on which he posted videos of patients claiming he’d been unfairly treated, and issued press releases on behalf of the Society for Advanced Spine Intervention, an organisation he had started. So who exactly is Richard Kaul? One clue is his ghostwritten autobiography, self-published earlier this year, called Arjun Rising. The book begins with a potted history of India’s struggle for independence, into which Kaul weaves his family history. He says he feels “spiritually connected” to an Indian prince called Arjuna, who features in some ancient Sanskrit texts and from whom Kaul gets his middle name. It’s a curious mix of self-aggrandisement and bizarre confessions: “Every year, up until 18, I ranked number one academically and I constantly won the award for best sportsman of the year”; “Once [as a toddler] when I was trying to make a statement, I took my nappy off and released my entire bowel in the middle of the living room floor.” Then there are lengthy sections that deal, in graphic detail, with Kaul’s sexual exploits. There’s the tally he kept at medical school “to see how many nurses we could have sex with over the years” and the time he “met this stunning girl from Athens and had great raw sex with her”. He also writes of his mother’s death from lung and skin cancer at the age of 43, how this affected him, and how he became addicted to recreational and prescription drugs, and spent periods in rehab. One line stayed with me: “The internal makeup of doctors is generally described as egocentric… [there’s] a cliff of expectations, ambitions and goals that they’re invincible and they will save the world.” Although he responds to my email fairly quickly, Kaul says he’s going to be out of the country, and we don’t meet until two months later. His office is on the ground floor of a nondescript building in a New Jersey suburb. He greets me at the door, smiling, wearing a black V-neck sweater and glasses. The office space he rents is empty save for some cardboard boxes and piles of paperwork: Kaul says that because he can no longer practise medicine, he’s not renewing the lease. We sit in an empty boardroom at a large wooden table. Kaul is disarmingly polite as he leads me through what he sees as the saga of his life. His girlfriend sits with us throughout. It all began, he says, with the death of Isatu Bangura. He insists his former receptionist was lying about him being on his mobile phone while Bangura stopped breathing in the dentist’s chair. “Having experienced the loss of my mother, I understood very well what her family were going through and at the end of the trial. I wanted to apologise to them. But they weren’t ready to accept the apology.” Has he apologised to them since? “No, I haven’t. And that’s something that has always stuck with me.” Kaul insists he was trained sufficiently to carry out the spinal procedures, and that they formed part of his anaesthesia training. “I have done thousands of cases,” he says, “and the evolution from interventional pain management into minimally invasive spine surgery is a very logical, natural one.” He says there is no recognised fellowship in minimally invasive spine surgery. “So when a doctor wants to get training, he goes and undertakes the same types of courses I had undertaken since 2002. There were no standards; there wasn’t one specific qualification or programme, and there still isn’t.” He says he performed “800 of these minimally invasive spinal procedures” and that out of those, only 11 people complained. (Later on, I speak to Dr Russell Nelson, founder and medical director of the Nelson Spine Institute in California and a spine surgeon for 30 years. Nelson tells me that someone trained in anaesthesia is not trained in spinal anatomy. There are two ways to become a spine surgeon in the US: you either train in orthopaedics or neurosurgery – both of which would usually be followed by a year-long spine fellowship taught by expert physicians. Doctors would then have to keep up with the latest developments via courses throughout their careers.) But Kaul believes New Jersey governor Chris Christie was given money by a small group of surgeons in return for asking the state’s medical board to take action against him, because he was operating on their turf. He insists he’s the victim of a “corrupt system” – that powerful interests came after him because “I was building a successful practice and moving medicine forward in a way that entrenched interests didn’t want.” Kaul tells me that patients found out about him on the internet because of the press the Bangura case received, and brought it up during their consultations with him. It got to the point, he says, that he couldn’t ignore it, so he came up with the idea for the autobiography to “set the record straight. I still feel I did nothing wrong. You know, when they first started this nonsense, if I had packed my bags and run away, I think that would have communicated to people that I was trying to hide something; that I was guilty of something. But that’s not the case.” While he is candid and friendly during our meeting, Kaul’s answers seem self-serving, unremorseful, or both. I wonder if his unwillingness to admit he was wrong and his subsequent PR campaign and book are the hallmarks of a narcissist.“Yeah, there will be people who’ll say that,” he says. “But I don’t think so. I did a lot of charity work here and treated a lot of patients who had no medical insurance, and I did that for free. I took my own money and used that to set up the Spine Africa Project, to do something positive where people had no healthcare.” Kaul set up his charity in 2008 to offer treatment to people across the continent suffering from degenerative spine injuries and deformities. Now that he’s closing his private practice in New Jersey, he says, he’ll channel all his efforts into that. On the Spine Africa website, the charity promises to train local doctors, improve facilities and raise awareness; it will also be treating people afflicted with spinal conditions. There’s a video documentary, too, that shows Kaul visiting the Panzi hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2011. He meets the hospital’s director and various patients. At the end, accompanied by uplifting music, Kaul operates on a boy with a spinal condition. “We’re all very excited for him,” he says as he removes the dressing covering the boy’s back. “He seems to be making progress in the right direction here.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Richard Kaul was a doctor who claimed to be an expert spinal surgeon, but he actually wasn't qualified for that. Many patients experienced pain and problems after he operated on them, and after realizing that he was not qualified to do those surgeries, some of them sued him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a new situation: Two neighboring cities had very different health related problems. Twin city had increased air pollution, their people experiencing all kinds of respiratory diseases, while Pine city had problems with age related diseases.  But I can use this background: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk.  What is an answer for this question: Which city had more people exposed to outdoor pollution? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Twin city had increased air pollution and their people experienced various respiratory diseases. Therefore, Twin city had more people exposed to outdoor pollution compared to Pine city, which had problems related to age-related diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a sentence that includes the following data about a restaurant","output":"The restaurant named The Rice Boat is a family-friendly dining establishment that specializes in Chinese cuisine, located in the serene riverside area; however, according to recent customer reviews, it has a low satisfaction score, receiving a rating of just 1 out of 5. This gastronomic venue provides a unique blend of Chinese food flavors, offering a variety of dishes that epitomize the rich culinary traditions of China amidst the tranquil scenery by the river.  Its diverse menu caters to a variety of tastes and preferences, making it an ideal option for families seeking a pleasant and enjoyable dining experience together. Despite this, it's worth mentioning that according to recent customer feedback, the restaurant does seem to have some areas of improvement to address given its current low rating of just one star out of a possible five — this makes it imperative for potential customers to factor in these reviews prior to planning their visit to The Rice Boat.  Nonetheless, situated in a picturesque riverside locale, this restaurant offers a unique dining ambiance that extends beyond the traditional confines of a four-walled setting, ensuring that while dining, patrons can take in the beautiful sights, savor the tranquil river views, and enjoy the refreshing atmosphere.  There seems to be a stark contrast between the potential that The Rice Boat has, largely owing to its prime riverside location, family-friendly services, and dedication to offering exclusive Chinese food, and the low customer approval ratings it currently boasts of. It suggests that there may be shortcomings in services or food quality that the management needs to review and improve upon.  In conclusion, while The Rice Boat, with its Chinese food offering and a majestic location on the riverside, creates a charming prospect for a family-friendly restaurant experience, it would be wise for customers to take into account its low rating of 1 out of 5 and consider this information as an essential part of their dining decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Son of Dracula Movie plot: Hungarian Count Alucard (Lon Chaney Jr.), a mysterious stranger, arrives in the U.S. invited by Katherine Caldwell (Louise Allbritton), one of the daughters of New Orleans plantation owner Colonel Caldwell (George Irving). Shortly after his arrival, the Colonel dies of apparent heart failure and leaves his wealth to his two daughters, with Claire receiving all the money and Katherine his estate \\"Dark Oaks.\\" Katherine, a woman with a taste for the morbid, has been secretly dating Alucard and eventually marries him, shunning her long-time boyfriend Frank Stanley. Frank confronts the couple and tries to shoot Alucard, but the bullets pass through the Count's body and hit Katherine, seemingly killing her. A shocked Frank runs off to Dr. Brewster, who visits Dark Oaks and is welcomed by Alucard and a living Katherine. The couple instruct him that henceforth they will be devoting their days to scientific research and only welcome visitors at night. Frank goes on to the police and confesses to the murder of Katherine. Brewster tries to convince the Sheriff that he saw Katherine alive and that she would be away all day, but the Sheriff insists on searching Dark Oaks. He finds Katherine's dead body and has her transferred to the morgue. Dr. Brewster is shown reading the novel \\"Dracula\\". Meanwhile, Hungarian Professor Lazlo arrives at Brewster's house. Brewster has noticed that Alucard is Dracula spelled backwards and Lazlo suspects vampirism. A local boy brought to Brewster's house confirms this suspicionâthere are bite marks on his neck. Later, the Count appears to Brewster and Lazlo but is driven away by a cross. Vampiric Katherine enters Frank's cell as a bat and starts his transformation. After he awakens, she tells him she still loves him. She explains that she only married Alucard (who is really Dracula himself) to obtain immortality and wants to share that immortality with Frank. He is initially repulsed by her idea, but then yields to her. After she explains that she has already drunk some of his blood, she... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Son of Dracula,\\" Katherine Caldwell, played by Louise Allbritton, is married to Hungarian Count Alucard, portrayed by Lon Chaney Jr. Count Alucard is a mysterious figure who arrives in the United States at the invitation of Katherine, and he quickly becomes entwined in the lives of Katherine and her family. Katherine is a character with a penchant for the dark and morbid, which likely contributes to her fascination with Alucard. She turns her back on her long-time boyfriend, Frank Stanley, in favor of pursuing a romantic relationship with the enigmatic Count. As the plot unfolds, it's revealed that Count Alucard is none other than Dracula himself, and Katherine marries him with the intention of gaining immortality. This development leads to multiple conflicts as Katherine transforms into a vampire and ultimately seeks to share her newfound immortality with Frank, her former lover. Despite his initial resistance, Frank eventually yields to Katherine's offer, but the consequences of this decision remain uncertain as the story unfolds. In essence, Katherine Caldwell is married to Count Alucard, aka Dracula, in the film \\"Son of Dracula.\\" Their relationship sets the stage for a series of events that explore themes of love, immortality, and the supernatural.

Step 1: Establish initial impressions From the very beginning, the film's lack of cohesive storytelling and character development fails to draw the viewer in, quickly unraveling any potential intrigue. As the plot progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to remain invested in the story or care about its one-dimensional characters. Step 2: Address the film's acting and dialogue The acting, unfortunately, does little to alleviate the lackluster narrative. Wooden performances and stilted dialogue create a sense of disconnect between the audience and the onscreen events. It doesn't help that the script often devolves into clichés and tired tropes, weighing down the actors' efforts. Step 3: Analyze the film's visuals and special effects From a visual standpoint, \\"The Timeless Dilemma\\" offers nothing extraordinary or memorable. The special effects, while competently executed, struggle to hide the film's low budget, ultimately detracting from the overall experience. Step 4: Assess the pacing and editing Pacing remains a consistent issue throughout the film, with scenes often dragging on longer than necessary and critical plot points feeling rushed or underexplored. In addition, the editing does little to remedy the disjointed nature of the storytelling, leading to an overall sense of confusion and disorientation. Step 5: Evaluate the film's conclusion \\"The Timeless Dilemma\\" limps towards its conclusion, offering little in the way of satisfying resolution or emotional payoff. Instead, the film's climax leaves viewers with more questions than answers and a profound sense of disappointment. Step 6: Concluding thoughts In summary, \\"The Timeless Dilemma\\" is a film best avoided, marred by a weak script, uninspired acting, and lackluster visuals. Unfortunately, this film's disappointing execution outweighs any potential it might have had, resulting in a forgettable and unsatisfying experience for audiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there's a simple way to elevate your apple-eating experience: washing and chilling them. In this article, we will walk you through the steps to properly prepare apples for an even more enjoyable and rejuvenating treat. Step 1: Washing the Apples Washing apples is essential, as it helps get rid of any dirt, pesticides, and bacteria that may be on their surface as well as any wax that can be present in store-bought apples. To do this, follow these steps: 1. Fill a large bowl or basin with water and a small amount of vinegar – about 1 part vinegar to 4 parts water should do. 2. Place the apples in the solution and allow them to soak for a few minutes. 3. Using your hands or a soft cloth, gently scrub the apples under the solution to remove any dirt, pesticides, and wax. 4. Rinse the apples with clean water to remove any residue from the vinegar solution. Step 2: Removing the Stems Removing the stems from apples not only enhances their appearance, but also makes them more convenient to eat. Moreover, pulling the stem out can help prevent any accidental swallowing of the stem. To do this, grasp the stem between your thumb and index finger, and gently twist and pull until it comes out. Step 3: Refrigerating the Apples Now that your apples are clean and stem-free, it's time to chill them. Chilled apples offer a more refreshing taste, making them even more enjoyable during the hot summer months. 1. Arrange the apples on a tray or plate, making sure there's enough space between each so they don't touch. 2. Place the tray or plate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. 3. When the time is up, remove the apples from the refrigerator and enjoy them immediately for the best taste. Conclusion As you can see, washing, de-stemming, and chilling apples is a simple process that can greatly enhance their flavor and make them more refreshing during summer months. With just a little bit of effort, you can turn apples into an even more enjoyable snack that's perfect for sharing with friends and family.

Like other women of her time, Elizabeth is required to wear the constricting corsets meant to create an hourglass figure, but she despises the discomfort it causes. She longs for a life of freedom and love, not limited by expectations and beauty standards of her time. Despite her resistance to societal norms, Elizabeth meets and falls in love with Liam, a charming and handsome young man from an esteemed family. He too believes that Elizabeth should not be following society's stringent beauty expectations, but more importantly, he finds himself falling in love with her strong spirit and determination. In the midst of their budding romance, Elizabeth and Liam attend a grand ball, thrown by Elizabeth's father. Wanting to make a lasting impression on Liam, Elizabeth orders her maid to tighten her corset more than usual. During the event, whilst sharing a dance, Elizabeth dramatically falls to the ground, gasping for air. This scares Liam, who insists that she and her family prioritize health and comfort over beauty standards. Despite the obvious dismissal of her health by her peers, the incident at the ball becomes the talk of the town, and Elizabeth starts to find herself ridiculed. Still, Liam openly supports her and encourages her to stand up for her beliefs, ultimately making their relationship stronger. This leads to conflict within their families, as they are both expected to conform to the societal norms.

She becomes determined to fight against these expectations and to remove the barriers that prevent herself and others from living a life free from the corset's tight grip. Together, Elizabeth and Liam start a movement for women's liberation, spreading their message through writing and art. As the movement grows, Elizabeth becomes a symbol of strength and hope, encouraging other women to break free from societal norms. In the end, Liam and Elizabeth cannot withstand the pressure from their families and society, and they choose to elope to build a life of their own. Despite leaving their families behind, they continue their fight for women's rights, ultimately changing the way history perceives beauty standards and gender norms.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: How do geese normally get from place to place?  Here are possible answers to this question: - carried by people - guard house - fly - follow ultralight airplane - group together  I believe the correct choice is \\"fly\\", here's why: A:","output":"Geese primarily get from place to place by flying, which makes \\"fly\\" the correct choice among the given options. Geese are highly efficient migratory birds with strong wings that enable them to fly long distances with minimal effort. Here's a detailed explanation of why flying is the primary mode of transportation for geese, and a brief overview of the alternative options provided: 1. Flying:  Geese rely on their impressive ability to fly as their primary means of getting from place to place. They are known for their distinguishing V-shaped flight formation, which helps reduce drag and conserve energy by taking advantage of the upwash currents created by the wingtips of the bird in front of them. This formation is particularly useful during migration, where geese fly thousands of miles to reach their nesting or wintering grounds. The wings of geese are designed for long-duration, energy-efficient flying, allowing them to cover great distances with minimal stops. 2. Carried by people:  Although geese can be carried by people, this is not a usual mode of transportation for them. They are wild animals capable of moving independently, and humans would only carry them in exceptional circumstances, such as rescuing an injured bird or transporting a domesticated goose. It is neither practical nor advisable for humans to carry geese as a standard method of transport. 3. Guard House:  The term \\"guardhouse\\" refers to a building or structure used to house security personnel or serve as a detention facility. This option is not relevant to the question of how geese travel from one place to another, as it does not pertain to the movement or transportation of birds. 4. Follow ultralight airplane:  It's true that there have been instances where geese were trained to follow ultralight airplanes for the purpose of studying migration or reintroducing young birds to a migratory route. However, this method is not employed for geese under normal circumstances and is a form of human intervention primarily applied in research or conservation efforts. Flying independently, as mentioned earlier, is the natural and standard mode of transportation for geese. 5. Group together: While geese do group together, this action by itself doesn't describe their mode of transportation. Geese are social birds, and they group together for various reasons, such as communication, protection, and resource-sharing. A flock of geese shares the benefits of cooperation during migration or while searching for food and resting spots. However, the act of grouping together does not explain how geese move from one place to another. In conclusion, geese primarily travel from place to place by flying. Their strong wings, V-shaped flight formation, and inclination for grouping together make them efficient travelers, especially during long-distance migrations. The other options provided are either unrelated or pertain to exceptional cases involving human intervention, making \\"fly\\" the most accurate and logical choice in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Detailed Instructions: You're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX. You need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to PersonY. This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"sympathetic\\" to \\"stern\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two i.e. the trigger word/phrase. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For your question, PersonY should be a well-agreed answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender.

Quilty goes mad when Humbert points a gun at him. After a mutually exhausting struggle for it, Quilty, now insane with fear, merely responds politely as Humbert repeatedly shoots him. He finally dies with a comical lack of interest, expressing his slight concern in an affected English accent.

He searches across the town for room to let, being tempted by widowed, sexually famished mother, Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her beautiful 14-year-old daughter, Dolores Haze (Sue Lyon), affectionately called Lolita (hence the title).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Hans Kristian Rausing, one of the heirs to to the multibillion pound Tetra Pak packaging dynasty, has been arrested in connection with the death of his wife Eva, after her body was found at their luxurious west London home.      The Metropolitan police said a body had been found at an address in Cadogan Place, Belgravia, one of the most exclusive streets in London.      The property had been searched following the earlier arrest in south London of a 49-year-old man on suspicion of possession of drugs, a spokesman said. The man was later rearrested in connection with the death, which is being treated as \\"unexplained\\". He is being held at a station in south London.      Though Scotland Yard has not yet confirmed his identity, the 49-year-old is understood to be Rausing, whose Swedish grandfather Ruben Rausing invented the Tetra Laval milk carton in the 1960s. His father Hans senior was ranked by Forbes in 2010 as the 64th richest man in the world.      A post mortem was opened at 1pm on Monday at Westminster mortuary. The dead woman has not yet been formally identified, but sources confirmed the body was that of Mrs Rausing.      The five storey terraced house is in one of London's most expensive areas just off Sloane Street, between Knightsbridge and Chelsea. Officers could be seen guarding the front door last night, which was taped off.      The couple, who have four teenage children, have struggled for many years with addiction to hard drugs, narrowly escaping prison in 2008 after heroin and £2,000 worth of crack cocaine were found at their home. Mrs Rausing had been arrested after trying to smuggle several wraps of cocaine into a reception at the American embassy in Grosvenor Square.      As part of their caution, the couple were required to attend a four-month drugs rehabilitation programme, and they were prominent benefactors of a number of anti-drugs charities, even while they continued to struggle with their own addictions.      The American-born Mrs Rausing, the daughter of a wealthy Pepsi executive, met her husband in the 1980s when they were both being treated at a US drug rehabilitation centre.      In a statement following her arrest in 2008, she said: \\"I have made a serious mistake which I very much regret,\\" she said. \\"I intend to leave as soon as possible to seek the help that I very much need. I have made a grave error and I consider myself to have taken a wrong turn in the course of my life. I am very sorry for the upset I have caused. I thank my family and friends for their kindness and understanding.\\"      After the hearing, the Rausing family said they \\"hope[d] with all their hearts\\" that the couple could \\"overcome their addiction\\", and that they would support them.      But the decision to drop charges in favour of a conditional caution attracted some criticism of double standards for wealthy offenders, and was described as \\"very surprising\\" by the then Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Ian Blair who said it \\"sends entirely the wrong message about drug use and disregards the harm it does to communities.\\" He added that the decision not to prosecute \\"reminds me of the 19th-century legal comment often attributed to Sir James Mathew: 'In England justice is open to all - just like the Ritz.'\\"      Though he was born into relatively modest middle-class circumstances in Sweden, Hans Kristian Rausing's life was transformed by the vast wealth generated by his grandfather's packaging invention, which permitted milk to be kept fresh without the need for refrigeration.      His father Hans Sr moved the family to Britain in the 1980s to avoid Sweden's higher tax regime, and in 1996 sold his half of the Tetra Pak company to his now late brother Gad for almost £5bn. The company is now controlled by Gad's three children, Jorn, Finn and Kirsten, who remain based in Sweden. Hans Sr, now in his 80s, lives in a 900-acre East Sussex estate, where he raises deer and collects vintage cars and is thought to have a personal fortune worth almost £6bn.      Hans Kristian has two sisters, the older of whom, Lisbet, studied at Berkeley and Harvard and went on to be a research fellow at Imperial College. Sigrid Rausing, his other sister, owns the literary magazine Granta and the publishing firm Portobello books, and is a noted philanthropist.      In an interview in 2004, she said great wealth was something that was not always easy to come to terms with: \\"Be open about it and be active with it.\\" She has said that her philanthropic habit developed partly from guilt, \\"but I think it was probably shame, if I can make that distinction. People knew you had money, so you could never say, 'Come back next month.'\\"      Eva and Hans Kristian Rausing were also philanthropists, supporting, among others, charities working in the arts, sport and anti-addiction charities. Mrs Rausing was even a patron of one charity, The Mentor Foundation, which worked to help people out of addiction and also boasts the Queen of Sweden, Queen Noor of Jordan and Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia as honorary trustees.      Prince Charles, with whom Hans K Rausing is said to be on first name terms, has described him as \\"a very special philanthropist\\" because of his support for drugs charities. ||||| One of Britain's richest women, American-born Eva Rausing, was found dead in her west London home and a man was arrested in connection with the case, British police said, adding that an autopsy had failed to uncover a formal cause of death.

British police said Tuesday they had arrested a 49-year-old man Monday on suspicion of drug possession and a subsequent search of an address in London's tony Belgravia neighborhood related to that arrest turned up Rausing's body later that day.      The man was widely named in the British media but police would not confirm his identity.      Scotland Yard said in a statement Tuesday that further tests were being carried out on Rausing's body after an autopsy was inconclusive. It said officers from the Homicide and Serious Crime division were investigating \\"and the death continues to be treated at this time as unexplained.\\"      The man arrested in connection with Rausing's death remained under arrest but was receiving medical attention at a location away from the police station, police said. They would not say if the man was under guard.      After the news broke, Eva Rausing's parents, Tom and Nancy Kemeny, and the rest of her family paid tribute to a \\"devoted wife\\" and mother of four \\"much loved and wonderful children,\\" saying they were devastated over her death. Their statement also alluded to her struggles.      \\"During her short lifetime she made a huge philanthropic impact, supporting a large number of charitable causes, not only financially, but using her own personal experiences,\\" the family said in a statement. \\"She bravely fought her health issues for many years.\\"      A statement from her in-laws, Hans and Marit Rausing, said they were \\"deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death.\\"      Eva Rausing supported a number of charities that helped to fight addictions. One of them _ Action on Addiction _ was among the first to express sadness over her death and praise her \\"wonderfully generous\\" support over the years.      She also was listed as a long-time supporter of The Prince's Foundation, part of a group of nonprofit charities that have Prince Charles as their patron. His office said the prince was told of Rausing's death but did not offer further comment.      In a diplomatic scandal in 2008, Eva Rausing was arrested outside the U.S. Embassy in for reportedly trying to bring crack cocaine and heroin into building in her handbag. Police later found small amounts of cocaine, crack and heroin in a search of the couple's 5 million-pound (then 10 million) London town house. The couple was charged with drug possession but prosecutors later agreed to drop the charges in exchange for formal police warnings.      At the time, the Rausing family issued a statement saying relatives were \\"deeply saddened\\" by the couple's drug problems and hoped they could overcome their addictions.      Hans Rausing's Swedish father helped transform TetraPak into a hugely successful manufacturer. The fortune of the senior Rausing and his family is estimated at 4.3 billion pounds (6.7 billion) by the Sunday Times Rich List.      ___      Cassandra Vinograd can be reached at http://twitter.com/CassVinograd ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Hans Kristian Rausing, an heir to the Tetra Pak packaging dynasty, has been arrested in connection with the death of his wife, Eva Rausing, whose body was found at their luxurious west London home.

We now face seven years in which the Belgian Government will not be President again.

Tässä lauseessa mainittu seitsemän vuoden ajanjakso viittaa siihen, että Belgian hallituksella ei ole mahdollisuutta toimia Euroopan unionin neuvoston puheenjohtajana seuraavien seitsemän vuoden aikana. Euroopan unionissa jäsenvaltioiden hallitusten puheenjohtajuus kiertää puolen vuoden välein, mikä tarkoittaa, että jokaisella jäsenvaltiolla on teoriassa mahdollisuus toimia neuvoston puheenjohtajana kahden ja puolen vuoden välein. Käytännössä kuitenkin monet muutkin asiat vaikuttavat puheenjohtajuuskausiin, kuten erilaisten prioriteettien huomiointi ja maiden välinen yhteistyö. Belgialle tämä tarkoittaa, että seuraavan kerran sen hallituksen mahdollisuus toimia neuvoston puheenjohtajana koittaa useiden vuosien päästä. Tänä aikana Belgian hallituksen on kuitenkin tärkeää jatkaa aktiivisena osallistujana Euroopan unionin päätöksentekoprosesseissa sekä pyrkiä vaikuttamaan unionin päätöksiin omien kantojensa ja etujensa mukaan. Belgialla on toki eurooppalaisen yhteistyön näkökulmasta suuri merkitys sen historiallisten saavutusten ja keskeisen sijainnin ansiosta Euroopassa. Esimerkiksi Eurooppa-neuvoston päämaja sijaitsee Belgian pääkaupungissa Brysselissä, joka tunnetaan usein myös Euroopan unionin pääkaupunkina.

Vaikka Belgian hallitus ei ole neuvoston puheenjohtaja seuraavan seitsemän vuoden aikana, sillä on edelleen tärkeä rooli Euroopan unionin sisällä.

A family desperate for answers has turned to the Internet to find out why their 10-month-old son can’t open his mouth.      Baby Wyatt’s lockjaw has baffled doctors since he was born, and although the Scott family has taken him to every specialist imaginable, they can’t figure out the root of the problem, Andrew Scott, the baby's father, told ABCNews.com.      So his wife, Amy, decided to create a website, WhatsWrongWithWyatt.com, in the hopes that someone will recognize the condition and offer a solution.      \\"Nobody that we’ve found has seen anything like this before,” Andrew Scott told ABCNews.com. “Hopefully, somebody will see it and will have some ideas on how we should go forward.\\"      Courtesy Andrew Scott      When Wyatt was born last June in Ottawa, Canada, doctors were immediately alarmed that he couldn’t open his mouth -- fearing he could not breathe and would need to be intubated, according to the Scotts’ blog. He spent the next three months in the hospital.      Since then, they have needed to call 911 six times because Wyatt was choking and unable to open his mouth, Andrew Scott said. Once, they needed to administer CPR, and another time, a bloody nose spilled out of his mouth and scared them all.      Wyatt's doctor, Dr. J. P. Vaccani, said the condition, congenital trismus, is rare and usually the result of a fused joint or extra band of tissue. But Wyatt’s CT and MRI scans appear to be normal.      \\"It's an unusual situation where he can’t open his mouth, and there’s no kind of obvious reason for it,” Vaccani, a pediatric otolaryngologist at Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario told ABCNews.com. “Otherwise, he’s a healthy boy.\\"      Courtesy Andrew Scott      Vaccani said it’s possible there’s a muscle problem, but to find out, doctors will need to put Wyatt to sleep and do a muscle biopsy. Unfortunately, anesthesiologists aren’t comfortable doing that just yet because they won’t be able to control his airways if they can’t open his mouth.      Like most babies, Wyatt has trouble controlling his secretions, such as saliva, Vaccani said. But normal babies can open their mouths when they become too full as a kind of fail-safe, he said. Wyatt can’t do that, which is why he chokes.      Courtesy Andrew Scott      Since the Scotts’ daughter started kindergarten, she’s been bringing home extra bugs and viruses, making it even tougher on Wyatt who gets sick and chokes.      “My daughter has an Elmo doll with band-aids on it. She treats him like her sick baby, too,” Andrew Scott said. “They’re pretty loving with him and everything.”      Courtesy Andrew Scott      Doctors have used Botox to relax Wyatt’s jaw muscles, allowing him to open his mouth a little bit, but it’s not a complete solution, Andrew Scott said.      Since launching the website this month, the Scotts have received dozens of emails from well-wishers and people who say they have ideas. Vaccani said a Vancouver dentist has already reached out to him to talk about a child he’s seen with a similar problem.      “The parents’ goal of awareness seems to be working because people are getting in contact with us,” he said. ||||| A nine-month-old baby in Ottawa is unable to open his mouth due to a rare condition and doctors don’t have any case history to help treat him.      Wyatt Scott has congenital trismus, an extremely rare disorder that prevents the young boy from opening his jaw.      Doctors at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) said the condition has its ripple effects that kept Wyatt there for nearly the first three months of his life and have sent him back for many emergency room visits.      \\"It can cause issues of getting food in with any nipple or bottle feeding and it can also have trouble for the secretions, so they often have associated swallowing difficulties,\\" said Dr. Jean-Philippe Vaccani.      \\"He's already had an episode where we had to perform CPR on him — it was from vomiting,\\" said his mother, Amy Miville.      \\"He started to cry, and then he started to choke and then he lost consciousness, so it's very dangerous.\\"      Hospital has no case history      Wyatt's parents said their son's condition is so rare that CHEO has no case study to look at to help determine a treatment.

First, we need to combine the terms that have \\"d\\" in them. So let's look at -4*d and 8*d.     -4*d is like taking away 4 d's, and 8*d is like adding 8 d's. 2. If you take away 4 d's (-4*d) and then add 8 d's (8*d), you will end up with 4 d's (because 8 - 4 = 4). So now our equation looks like this:     4*d + 12 = 0 3. Now, we want to get \\"d\\" all by itself. To do that, we need to get rid of the 12 on the same side as d. We can think of the 12 as being added to the 4 d's, so we will do the opposite to cancel it out, which is subtracting 12 from both sides. Here's what the new equation will look like:     4*d = -12 (we subtracted 12 from both sides) 4. We're getting closer! Now we have 4 times d equals -12 (4*d = -12). To find out what \\"d\\" is, we need to divide both sides by 4 because right now it's multiplied by 4. This is what the final step looks like:     d = -12 ÷ 4 5. And when we do that division, we find out that \\"d\\" is equal to -3, because -12 divided by 4 equals -3.

Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group.  Which group didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the other group?  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, it can be determined that the Blue group, which focused on weight training for 3 months, did not increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months.

On the other hand, the hint also indicates that running exercises enhance the strength and efficiency of cardiac muscles, which are responsible for pumping blood through the heart. 3. Since the Blue group was involved in weight training, their primary improvement was in the size and strength of their skeletal muscles rather than their cardiac muscles. 4.

Article: About a third of all tumors discovered in routine mammography screenings are unlikely to result in illness, according to a new study that says 30 years of the breast cancer exams have resulted in the overdiagnosis of 1.3 million American women.The report, published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, argues that the increase in breast cancer survival rates over the last few decades is due mostly to improved therapies and not screenings, which are intended to flag tumors when they are small and most susceptible to treatment. Instead, the widespread use of mammograms now results in the overdiagnosis of breast cancer in roughly 70,000 patients each year, needlessly exposing those women to the cost and trauma of treatment, the authors wrote.\\"Our study raises serious questions about the value of screening mammography,\\" wrote Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at Dartmouth College 's Geisel School of Medicine. \\"It clarifies that the benefit of mortality reduction is probably smaller, and the harm of overdiagnosis probably larger, than has been previously recognized.\\"The study adds to a long-running controversy over screening mammography. Its conclusions are based upon an increasing recognition that sophisticated screening can detect ever-smaller groups of cancer-like cells that would never become dangerous if left alone.Some radiologists and other proponents of routine annual screenings denounced the study as harmful to women and said it was part of a coordinated campaign to cut back on the tests to reduce healthcare expenses.\\"This is simply malicious nonsense,\\" said Dr. Daniel B. Kopans, a senior breast imager at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . \\"It is time to stop blaming mammography screening for 'overdiagnosis' and 'overtreatment' in an effort to deny women access to screening.\\"Welch and Dr. Archie Bleyer, an oncologist in Bend, Ore., analyzed screening data collected by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . They found that between 1976 and 2008, diagnosis of early-stage cancers had more than doubled from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women. Meanwhile, the number of late-stage cancers fell 8%, from 102 cases to 94 cases per 100,000 women.The authors reasoned that if screening were to help patients, it must not only find more early-stage cancers — which it has — it must also reduce the incidence of late-stage cancers, because the tumors would have been eliminated when they were small.But the data found that this was not the case. For every 122 additional breast cancers detected early, the number of late-stage cancers fell by only eight. To the authors, this suggested something other than screening was largely responsible for the drop in breast cancer deaths.Welch said the gap was even more apparent when they factored in data for women under the age of 40, who are generally too young to get regular mammograms and therefore served as a control group of sorts. The rate of breast cancer deaths for women 40 and over declined by 28% over the 32 years, while deaths for younger women fell by 42%.\\"There was a larger relative reduction in mortality among women who were not exposed to screening mammography than among those who were exposed,\\" the authors wrote. \\"We are left to conclude, as others have, that the good news in breast cancer — decreasing mortality — must largely be the result of improved treatment, not screening.\\"Welch, an expert on screening and overdiagnosis for many forms of cancer, said the disparity between early- and late-stage diagnosis trends was probably the result of tumors being detected that were too small to ever cause clinical symptoms. He said it was likely that many of the suspicious cells revealed by screening mammography would have regressed, or never progressed to malignancy.The idea that breast tumors may resolve on their own has been advanced by European doctors for several years. Welch and others suspect that screening technology has allowed doctors to find cells that may resemble cancer, but whose true nature is only beginning to be understood.\\"We hear the word 'cancer' and we all assume the definition that's in my medical dictionary — it's a tumor that, left untreated, will inexorably grow and cause death,\\" Welch said. \\"But now, as we look for really early forms of the disease, we realize the pathologic definition of cancer includes abnormalities that may come and go.\\"Such growths are so small that in the past they would never have been detected by a doctor or reported by a patient. That is no longer the case, Welch said.\\"Our ability to detect things is far ahead of our wisdom of knowing what they really mean,\\" he said.What's more, cancers can now be treated successfully even after they grow large enough to cause symptoms, thereby reducing the benefit of catching them at the earliest stages. He compared screening for breast cancer to screening for pneumonia : \\"Since pneumonia can be treated successfully, no one would suggest that we screen for it.\\"The study was roundly criticized by radiologists who specialize in breast imaging, who questioned its methodology and the suggestion that some cancer-like growths should be ignored.\\"It's kind of unbelievable that they're telling us we're finding too many early-stage cancers,\\" said Dr. Stamatia Destounis, a breast imager in Rochester, N.Y. \\"Isn't that the point?\\"She acknowledged that screening mammography was not perfect and that some growths would be discovered that were benign. However, the notion that cancer-like masses should not be treated was difficult to accept.\\"There is no way for us to know which early-stage breast cancer would not progress and which one would progress to an invasive, aggressive breast cancer,\\" Destounis said. \\"How would we tell a patient, 'Chances are this is early and it's probably not going to progress for a long time, if ever, so I don't think you need to do much here'? There's just no way for us to say that.\\"Dr. Stephen Feig, a radiologist at UC Irvine and president of the American Society of Breast Disease, called the study scientifically weak and worried that it would dissuade women from undergoing screening. \\"This is actually harming women,\\" he said.Most medical organizations, including the American Cancer Society , advise healthy women to get screened every one or two years beginning at age 40.In 2009, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force came to the controversial conclusion that this level of testing exacted an unnecessary toll on patients in the form of financial cost, anxiety, radiation exposure, false positives and overtreatment. The government advisory panel now recommends that women between the ages of 50 and 74 with no risk factors for breast cancer be screened every other year. Women who are at increased risk — because of family history or certain genetic characteristics — may begin screening at age 40 and have mammograms more often, the panel says.Welch said he was not advising women to stop being screened, only that they should be aware of mammography's shortcomings. Instead of conducting annual screenings on the basis of age, he said, the test should be based on risk: \\"It's women at the highest risk of dying from breast cancer that stand to benefit the most from screening, and they're the least likely to be overdiagnosed.\\"He also emphasized that women who develop symptoms, such as a lump in the breast, should not hesitate to get a mammogram.\\"No one argues about the value of diagnostic mammography,\\" he said. \\"The question is whether we should invite women, coerce them, threaten them, scare them to come get checked when nothing's wrong.\\" ||||| The growing use of routine mammograms over the past 30 years has done little to lower the death rate from breast cancer but has sharply increased the number of women who are wrongly diagnosed with the disease, a new study reported. (Rui Vieira/ASSOCIATED PRESS)      The routine use of mammograms has led to more than 1 million women being unnecessarily treated for breast cancer over the past three decades, according to the latest scientific report to cast skepticism on the effectiveness of the test.      The study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, concluded that nearly one-third of women diagnosed with breast cancer would never have developed the full-blown disease if left untreated.      Nevertheless, in such cases patients typically undergo invasive procedures such as surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, said H. Gilbert Welch, a coauthor of the study and a professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College. “These are major medical interventions and they’re certainly not something you would want to undergo if you didn’t need to,” he said.      The researchers also concluded that today’s sharply lower death rate for breast cancer is mainly due to factors such as improved treatments rather than early detection through mammograms.      The new study immediately fueled the already fierce debate over how often women should get mammograms, a controversy that has embroiled policymakers, politicians and physicians, as well as their female patients.      The American Cancer Society warned that the study “must be viewed with caution.” The American College of Radiology attacked the validity of the study, charging that it was spreading “misinformation” and “the cost may be lost lives.”      The report is the latest study to undermine the once-strong consensus that regular screenings are crucial to safeguarding women’s health. Just in the past two years, a major study of Norwegian breast cancer patients found that routine mammograms reduced the risk of dying from breast cancer by less than 10 percent. Another study found no effect on death rates when comparing European nations where screening became prevalent in the 1990s with those where it became widespread in the 2000s.      Even before those findings, in November 2009, a key federal panel revised its guidelines on mammograms to say that women should begin regular screenings at age 50 rather than age 40, and then get the exam every other year rather than annually.      However, that revision by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, made as Congress was crafting the new health-care law, was assailed not only by groups such as the American Cancer Society and the American College of Radiology but also by the Obama administration.      In 2010, lawmakers tweaked a mandate in the health-care law requiring insurers to cover preventive services recommended by the task force free of charge. The law specifies that when it comes to mammograms, insurers must follow the task force’s old guidelines.      Wednesday’s study analyzed changes in the rates of early- and late-stage breast cancer in the United States over time.      The authors’ premise was that if screening were effective, its growing use would result in greater detection of early-stage breast cancers and a corresponding drop in the prevalence of late-stage cancers.      Instead, they found that while the number of early-stage cancers doubled over the past three decades, the rate at which women were found to have late-stage cancer dropped by only 8 percent.      Welch speculated that as mammography technology has become more advanced, doctors are discovering breast lesions in such an early state of development it is virtually impossible to distinguish them from benign cell clusters.      Yet even as the screenings produce false positives, they fail to catch forms of breast cancer that develop rapidly, explaining why the more widespread use of screenings has done so little to curb the rate at which late-stage breast cancer is found.      “The sad fact is that there’s a subset of women who develop such an aggressive form of cancer it literally can’t be caught early,” said Welch.      Debra L. Monticciolo, a physician who chairs the American College of Radiology’s Quality and Safety Commission, questioned many of the study’s methods, including the data used to account for fluctuations in the underlying incidence of breast cancer due to factors like the use of hormones.      “It stuns me that this got through peer review,” said Monticciolo.      She added that as a physician, she found it hard to believe that such a large share of screenings produce false positives. If that were the case, there would be countless tales of miraculous recoveries by women who refuse traditional treatment after being diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.      “I’ve never seen such a case. And there’s nothing like that in the literature,” said Monticciolo.      Most important, she said, new studies continue to confirm the benefits of screenings.      “Mammograms clearly save lives,” she said.      Archie Bleyer, a professor at the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University who is the study’s other coauthor, said he wouldn’t dream of suggesting that women cease getting mammograms altogether.      “There are clearly women who are benefiting from doing this,” he said.      But he and Welch said their findings suggest that the message to women about mammograms needs to be more nuanced.      “We need to start telling the truth,” said Welch. “We’ve promoted this as if it’s the most important thing a woman can do for her health. . . . And the truth is that it’s a really close call.”      Women in their 40s who feel comfortable getting annual mammograms should not be dissuaded from doing so, he said. “But women who have never felt good about it, who felt coerced into the procedure, should feel equally good about not having it.”      Similarly, Welch said, women who do get screening mammograms and are found to have a tumor in a very early stage may want to consider alternatives to aggressive treatment — engaging in watchful waiting, for instance, or signing up for a clinical trial of drugs that may halt or slow the progression of cancer. Men have faced similar issues in deciding what to do about screening and treatment of prostate cancer, he said.      “We should tell women about the trade-offs and we should allow them to make their own decision,” he said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A study has found that about a third of all tumors discovered during routine mammography screenings may not result in illness, suggesting that 30 years of breast cancer screening has led to the overdiagnosis of 1.3 million American women. The study claims that the increase in breast cancer survival rates over the last few decades is mostly due to improved treatment, rather than screenings. The widespread use of mammograms now results in the overdiagnosis of breast cancer in around 70,000 patients each year, exposing these women to the cost and trauma of treatment. This study adds to the long-running controversy over mammography screening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.  - Sudan (\\"as-Sdn\\", ), also known as North Sudan and officially the Republic of the Sudan (\\"Jumhriyyat as-Sdn\\"), is a country in Northern Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea, Eritrea, and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west and Libya to the northwest. It is the third largest country in Africa. The River Nile divides the country into eastern and western halves. Before the Sudanese Civil War, South Sudan was part of Sudan but broke away in 2011. Its predominant religion is Islam.  - A land bridge, in biogeography, is an isthmus or wider land connection between otherwise separate areas, over which animals and plants are able to cross and colonise new lands. A land bridge can be created by marine regression, in which sea levels fall, exposing shallow, previously submerged sections of continental shelf; or when new land is created by plate tectonics; or occasionally when the sea floor rises due to post-glacial rebound after an ice age.  - The Red Sea (also the Erythraean Sea) is a seawater inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and Asia. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To the north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal). The Red Sea is a Global 200 ecoregion. The sea is underlain by the Red Sea Rift which is part of the Great Rift Valley.  - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it.  - Libya (\\"\\") is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. The three traditional parts of the country are Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world.  - The Gulf of Aqaba (\\"Khalij al-Aqabah\\") or Gulf of Eilat (\\"Mifrats Eilat\\") is a large gulf at the northern tip of the Red Sea, east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian mainland. Its coastline is divided between four countries: Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.  - A tomb (from \\"tumbos\\") is a repository for the remains of the dead. It is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes.  - Duathathor-Henuttawy, Henuttawy or Henttawy \\"(\\"Adorer of Hathor; Mistress of the Two Lands\\")\\" was an ancient Egyptian princess and later queen.  - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE.  - Jordan ('), officially The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ('), is an Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, Israel, Palestine and the Dead Sea to the west and the Red Sea in its extreme south-west. Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Ramesses XI (also written Ramses and Rameses) reigned from 1107 BC to 1078 BC or 1077 BC and was the tenth and final pharaoh of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt. He ruled Egypt for at least 29 years although some Egyptologists think he could have ruled for as long as 30. The latter figure would be up to 2 years beyond this king's highest known date of Year 10 of the \\"Whm Mswt\\" era or Year 28 of his reign. One scholar, Ad Thijs, has even suggested that Ramesses XI reigned as long as 33 yearssuch is the degree of uncertainty surrounding the end of his long reign.  - Chronological and genealogical position. While the High Priest of Amun Piankh (or Payankh) has been assumed to be a son-in-law of Herihor and his heir to the Theban office of the High Priest of Amun, recent studies by Karl Jansen-Winkeln of the surviving temple inscriptions and monumental works by Herihor and Piankh in Upper Egypt imply that Piankh was actually Herihor's predecessor.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area).  - The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak, comprises a vast mix of decayed temples, chapels, pylons, and other buildings. Building at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I in the Middle Kingdom and continued into the Ptolemaic period, although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian \\"Ipet-isut\\" (\\"The Most Selected of Places\\") and the main place of worship of the eighteenth dynasty Theban Triad with the god Amun as its head. It is part of the monumental city of Thebes. The Karnak complex gives its name to the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, north of Luxor.  - Saudi Arabia, officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is an Arab sovereign state in Western Asia constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula. With a land area of approximately , Saudi Arabia is geographically the fifth-largest state in Asia and second-largest state in the Arab world after Algeria. Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south. It is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert or barren landforms.  - The Temple of Khonsu is an ancient Egyptian temple. It is located with the large Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, in Luxor, Egypt. The edifice is an example of an almost complete New Kingdom temple, and was originally constructed by Ramesses III, on the site of an earlier temple. The gateway of this temple is at the end of the avenue of sphinxes that ran to the Luxor Temple. In Ptolemaic times,Ptolemy III Euergetes constructed a great gateway and enclosure wall for the temple; only the gateway now remains (see below). Inscriptions inside the forecourt of the temple were made in the time of Herihor.  - Pinedjem I was the High Priest of Amun at Thebes in Ancient Egypt from 1070 to 1032 BC and the \\"de facto\\" ruler of the south of the country from 1054 BC. He was the son of the High Priest Piankh. However, many Egyptologists today believe that the succession in the Amun priesthood actually ran from Piankh to Herihor to Pinedjem I. Reign. According to the new hypothesis regarding the succession of the Amun priesthood, Pinedjem I was too young to succeed to the High Priesthood of Amun after the death of Piankh. Herihor instead intervened to assume to this office. After Herihor's death, Pinedjem I finally claimed this office which had once been held by his father Piankh. This interpretation is supported by the decorations from the Temple of Khonsu at Karnak where Herihor's wall reliefs here are immediately followed by those of Pinedjem I with no intervening phase for Piankh and also by the long career of Pinedjem I who served as High Priest of Amun and later as king at Thebes.  He inherited a political and religious base of power at Thebes. Pinedjem strengthened his control over both Middle and Upper Egypt and asserted his kingdom's virtual independence from the Twenty-first Dynasty based at Tanis. He married Duathathor-Henuttawy, a daughter of Ramesses XI, to cement his relations with the other powerful families of the period. Their son, Psusennes I, went on to become Pharaoh at Tanis, thereby removing at a stroke the gap between the two families. In practice, however, the 21st dynasty kings and the Theban high priests were probably never very far apart politically since they respected each other's political autonomy.  - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards.  - The Valley of the Kings, the \\"Valley of the Gates of the Kings\\", is a valley in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the 16th to 11th century BC, tombs were constructed for the Pharaohs and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom (the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties of Ancient Egypt).  - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.  - KV4 is a tomb in the Valley of the Kings ( Egypt ) . The tomb was initiated for the burial of Ramesses XI but it is likely that its construction was abandoned and that it was never used for Ramesses 's interment . It also seems likely that Pinedjem I intended to usurp this tomb for his own burial , but that he too abandoned the plan . KV4 is notable for being the last royal tomb that was quarried in the Valley and because it has been interpreted as being a workshop used during the official dismantling of the royal necropolis in the early Third Intermediate Period .  - Khepermaatre Ramesses X (also written Ramses and Rameses) (ruled c. 1111 BC  1107 BC) was the ninth ruler of the 20th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. His birth name was Amonhirkhepeshef. His \\"prenomen\\" or throne name, Khepermaatre, means \\"The Justice of Re Abides.\\"   - Psusennes I (Greek ) was the third pharaoh of the 21st Dynasty who ruled from Tanis between 1047  1001 BC. \\"Psusennes\\" is the Greek version of his original name Pasibkhanu or Hor-Pasebakhaenniut (Egyptian \\"or-p3-sib3--<n>-niwt\\") which means \\"The Star Appearing in the City\\" while his throne name, Akheperre Setepenamun, translates as \\"Great are the Manifestations of Ra, chosen of Amun.\\" He was the son of Pinedjem I and Henuttawy, Ramesses XI's daughter by Tentamun.

Its capital is the city of Ayacucho. The region was one of the hardest hit by terrorism during the 1980s during the guerrilla war waged by Shining Path known as the internal conflict in Peru.  - El Callao (or ) is the chief seaport of Peru. The city is also called Provincia Constitucional (Constitutional Province), the only province of the Callao Region. The Historic Centre of Callao is located west of Historic Centre of Lima, the country's capital, and is part of the Lima Metropolitan Area. Callao borders Lima Province on the north, east and south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west.  - The Battle of Ayacucho was a decisive military encounter during the Peruvian War of Independence. It was the battle that secured the independence of Peru and ensured independence for the rest of South America. In Peru it is considered the end of the Spanish American wars of independence, although the campaign of the victor Antonio José de Sucre, continued through 1825 in Upper Peru and the siege of the fortresses Chiloé and Callao finally ended in 1826.  - Antonio José de Sucre y Alcalá (17951830), known as the \\"Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho\\", was a Venezuelan independence leader and the second President of Bolivia. Sucre was one of Simón Bolívar's closest friends, generals and statesmen. The city of Sucre, Bolivia's capital, is named for him, as is a state of Venezuela and a department of Colombia.  - \\"This article is about a historical region now in Bolivia. Alto Perú is also the name of a shanty town area just outside Lima, Peru (see Asociacion SOLAC).\\"  - Ayacucho, is the capital city of Huamanga Province, Ayacucho Region, Peru.  - Huamanga is a province in northern part of the Ayacucho Region in Peru. The capital of the province is the city of Ayacucho.  - The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, after the French invasion of Spain during Europe's Napoleonic Wars. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to crown policies the restricted trade and privileged Spanish-born officials over American-born, \\"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\\" These conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. When the Central Junta fell to the French invasion, in 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas. The conflicts among these colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the SpanishAmerican War in 1898.  - The Peruvian War of Independence was composed of a series of military conflicts beginning in 1811 that culminated in 1824 with the defeat of the Spanish Empire in the battles of Junin and Ayacucho. During the previous decade Peru had been a stronghold for royalists, who fought those in favor of independence in Upper Peru, Quito and Chile. The wars of independence took place with the background of the 1780-1781 uprising by indigenous leader Túpac Amaru II and the earlier removal of Upper Peru and the Río de la Plata regions from the Viceroyalty of Peru. Because of this the viceroy often had the support of the \\"Lima oligarchy,\\" who saw their elite interests threatened by popular rebellion and were opposed to the new commercial class in Buenos Aires. Among the most important events during the war was the proclamation of independence of Peru by José de San Martín on July 28, 1821.  - The Historical Sanctum of the Pampa of Ayacucho settled on August 14 , 1980 , by means of Supreme Decree N ° 119 - 80 - AA .

Accusing him of being a warlock, Schweik is dragged down to the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his dire warnings of evil to be unleashed.New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. No sooner has architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show her around the property, strange incidents begin to happen.

Next, a plumber, named Joe, attempts to repair a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is murdered by a presence that emerged from behind a slim-caked wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further chilled by the creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel.

Given the following context:  During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

Consequently, she found herself in a peculiar predicament, having to carefully extract several individual bills and fold them in half in order to accommodate the unwieldy pile into her once well-organized, slender wallet. This endeavor turned out to be quite time-consuming, much to her chagrin, as she fumbled to make room for each bill, wondering how exactly this unexpected windfall had landed into her hands. Initially, she considered multiple alternative methods to store her newly acquired wealth, such as procuring a more spacious wallet or perhaps a small, secure pouch specifically designed for such occasions. Yet, the urgency of the situation, along with unforeseen logistical challenges, presented an obstacle in pursuing these options for temporary storage of the cash. As Jill continued to stuff some of the bills into the various compartments of her wallet, an idea struck her like a lightning bolt – she could use this unexpected financial boost to do something meaningful. Instead of simply depositing the money into her bank account or splurging on an impulsive shopping spree, she could perhaps invest it in her education, put it towards a well-deserved family vacation, or even support a cause that was close to her heart. Thoughts raced through her mind as a fresh sense of excitement coursed through her veins, the initial annoyance of the uncooperative cash and overfilled wallet now masked by the potential future opportunities that lay ahead of her. In her heart of hearts, she knew that this moment carried immense transformative potential – Jill had to ensure that it counted. Emboldened and inspired by the bevy of possibilities, she carefully placed the remainder of the cash inside her wallet, vowing to herself to put it to good use and make the most significant impact possible.

However, you're correct in noting that United States Senators are popularly elected for a six-year term, beginning January 3rd. This applies to all U.S states, not only Pennsylvania. Senators may serve unlimited consecutive terms. This six-year term length was designed for stability, ensuring that the entire senate isn't up for election at the same time. Only one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years. This ensures that two-thirds of the senators will always have at least two years of experience.    Remember, these specific senators may change as they're dependent on election results.

Nintendo staff members reported that demo users complained about the difficulty of the control scheme. Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of \\"forcing\\" users to adapt, instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use. He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on comfort and ease.[q] The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses.[r] In addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword. To solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures—something E3 attendees had commented they would like to see. This reintroduced the problem of using a right-handed swing to control a left-handed sword attack. The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link's character model, so they instead flipped the entire game—everything was made a mirror image.[s] Link was now right-handed, and references to \\"east\\" and \\"west\\" were switched around. The GameCube version, however, was left with the original orientation.

Context: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent.

Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction.

The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe, killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.

When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year.  In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent.  Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care.

Are ballerinas allowed to get tanned?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same. They address different aspects of a ballerina's life and career. Let's look at each question separately for a better understanding. 1. Ballet: What do a ballerina's feet look like at the end of her career? This question is regarding the physical appearance and condition of a ballerina's feet after having spent a significant amount of time practicing, performing, and living as a professional ballet dancer. Ballet is an extremely demanding and physically strenuous art form, requiring ballerinas to perform on their toes (en pointe) and execute a variety of jumps, spins, and movements that put considerable stress on their feet and bodies. As a result, it is not uncommon for ballerinas to experience various foot problems, injuries, or deformities over the course of their careers. These issues might include calluses, blisters, bunions, hammertoes, ingrown toenails, and stress fractures, among others. The level of wear and tear on a ballerina's feet can greatly depend on factors such as the duration of her career, the intensity of her training and performance schedule, and her personal foot care and injury prevention habits.  Hence, this question primarily focuses on understanding the physical consequences of a long-term career in ballet on a dancer's feet, which may or may not have lifelong effects on their overall health and mobility. 2. Are ballerinas allowed to get tanned? This question relates to the aesthetic or visual aspect of a ballet dancer's appearance, specifically in regard to their skin color and whether they are allowed or encouraged to get a tan. Ballet companies and schools often have particular aesthetic preferences or requirements for their dancers, which can include factors such as height, body type, hair color, and even skin tone. These preferences can vary depending on the company, the artistic director, the country, and evolving cultural norms. Traditionally, ballet emphasized a uniform look for dancers, often preferring light skin tones. However, as ballet becomes more diverse and inclusive, this mindset has begun to change. In contemporary ballet companies, there is a greater variety in the skin tones of their dancers, and as such, tanning might not be strictly regulated or considered an issue. That being said, many dancers may still adhere to specific aesthetic guidelines or preferences set by their companies, which could require them to maintain a certain skin tone or appearance. It's also essential to consider the potential health risks associated with excessive tanning, from skin damage to increased risk of skin cancer. In summary, the two questions address distinct aspects of a ballerina's life. The first focuses on the physical impact of a ballet career on a dancer's feet, while the second deals with the aesthetic requirements for a dancer's appearance, specifically skin tone, and the evolving conversation around diverse representation in ballet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After she awakens from one, she looks at her dream journal, which includes drawings detailing characters and events from the first film; during this, she recalls a vision that picks up immediately where the first film ended: after the Tall Man's minions attacked Mike through his bedroom mirror, Reggie heard the commotion and ran upstairs to his aid. He tried to get a shotgun, but was attacked by Lurkers and had to flee, although he managed to surreptitiously snuff the pilot lights on the stove. Once upstairs, he dodged the Tall Man and rescued Mike, and the two dove out of the bedroom window to escape as the gas fumes reached the living room fireplace and destroyed the house. Following this, Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him.Having been institutionalized as delusional since the first film, Mike feels he can no longer ignore Liz's dream pleas, and fakes his recovery to obtain a doctor's release.

Summarize the following: To calculate the approximate yield to maturity, you need to know the coupon payment, the face value of the bond, the price paid for the bond and the number of years to maturity.  These figures are plugged into the formula ApproxYTM=(C+((F−P)/n))/(F+P)/2{displaystyle ApproxYTM=(C+((F-P)/n))/(F+P)/2}.  C = the coupon payment, or the amount paid in interest to the bond holder each year. F = the face value, or the full value of the bond. P = the price the investor paid for the bond. n = the number of years to maturity. Suppose you purchased a 1,000 for 920.  The interest is 10 percent, and it will mature in 10 years.  The coupon payment is 100 (1,000x.10=100{displaystyle 1,000x.10=100}).  The face value is 1,000, and the price is 920.  The number of years to maturity is 10.  Use the formula: (100+((1,000−920)/10))/(1,000+920)/2{displaystyle (100+((1,000-920)/10))/(1,000+920)/2}  Using this calculation, you arrive at an approximate yield to maturity of 11.25 percent. Plug the yield to maturity back into the formula to solve for P, the price.  Chances are, you will not arrive at the same value.  This is because this yield to maturity calculation is an estimate.  Decide whether you are satisfied with the estimate or if you need more precise information.  Use the formula P=C∗((1−(1/(1+i)n))/i)+M/((1+i)n){displaystyle P=C*((1-(1/(1+i)^{n}))/i)+M/((1+i)^{n})}, where, P = the bond price, C = the coupon payment, i = the yield to maturity rate, M = the face value and n = the total number of coupon payments. If you plug the 11.25 percent YTM into the formula to solve for P, the price, you get a price of 927.15. A lower yield to maturity will result in a higher bond price.  The bond price you get when you plug the 11.25 percent interest figure back into the formula is too high, indicating that this YTM estimate may be somewhat low. Summary:","output":"To find out how much money you can make from a bond, you need to use a special math recipe called \\"yield to maturity\\" (YTM). You need a few ingredients for this recipe: the yearly interest payment, the bond's full value, how much you paid for the bond, and how many years until the bond is all done. There's a formula you can use to help you figure it out. For example, imagine you bought a bond worth 1,000 for 920. It pays 10% interest per year and ends in 10 years. You use the formula and find out that you'll make about 11.25% more money each year. But this number is just an estimate, and it might not be exactly right. If you want to be more precise and find the exact bond price, you can use a different formula. With this formula, you can see you should have paid 927.15 instead of 920, which means the 11.25 % estimate may be a little low."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The last time Fernando Alonso joined McLaren, he left the team one season into a three-year contract after falling out spectacularly with the team's figurehead, Ron Dennis. Seven years on, the two men find themselves cast together all over again, in the hope that this time the story ends a little more happily. Up and down the Formula 1 paddock, the thought of the single-minded two-time world champion and McLaren's overbearing chairman working together again continues to be viewed with incredulity. How, many people ask, can McLaren have voluntarily re-signed a man who effectively cost them nearly £50m and got them thrown out of the 2007 constructors' world championship? It's an important question in the context of the 33-year-old rejoining McLaren - if, to some extent, a misleading representation of what happened. So, before we turn our attention to 2015, and the prospects for driver, team and their new engine partnership with Honda, we have to take a closer look at what happened a little over seven years ago during that tumultuous summer. Alonso joined McLaren in 2007 straight after winning two consecutive titles with Renault. They were symbolic of the passing of the flame from one generation to the next. Michael Schumacher, beaten in a straight fight in 2006, had retired, and Alonso was established as the new standard in F1. His season with McLaren coincided with their involvement in the 'spy-gate' scandal, in which their chief designer was found in possession of 780 pages of confidential Ferrari technical information. At an initial hearing by governing body the FIA, McLaren were found guilty of breaking the rules, but escaped punishment on the grounds there was no evidence the information had benefited the team. That seemed to be that until a few weeks later when, in the course of a bitter row with Dennis over the weekend of the Hungarian Grand Prix, Alonso threatened to reveal to the FIA potentially incriminating email conversations with McLaren test driver Pedro De La Rosa on the subject of the Ferrari information. A little while later, Alonso's adviser came back and apologised, explaining the Spaniard had been upset and wanted to take back the threat. But rather than wait for Alonso to calm down and talk it over again, Dennis had panicked and phoned FIA president Max Mosley to tell him of the existence of the emails, while assuring him there was \\"no information, nothing to come out\\". It was a miscalculation, albeit an understandable one in the context of the febrile, paranoid atmosphere at the time and Dennis's antagonistic personal relationship with Mosley. And despite Dennis's reassurances, the case was reopened and McLaren were hit by the aforementioned punishment. As it turned out, Dennis's phone call made no difference. Mosley already knew about the emails and was planning to re-open the case. Media playback is not supported on this device The point, though, is that Dennis's actions were a reflection of how bad his relationship with Alonso had become, in the context of the knowledge that Alonso's manager was Flavio Briatore, then the team principal of Renault. Briatore was a close friend of F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone and - like Mosley and Ecclestone - no fan of Dennis on a personal level. Whether or not Alonso's threat was real did not really matter. Once he made it, the result was inevitable. If Alonso knew, Dennis figured, so did Briatore - and, given the relationships involved, it was asking too much for that information not to make it to Mosley one way or another. And Dennis was right - Mosley says now that he knew about the emails because Alonso had told Briatore about them, and Briatore had blabbed. Why, you might wonder, would McLaren want Alonso back, after all that? The first and most important reason is obvious - because they believe he is about the best driver out there. The second is that McLaren need to make a statement of intent at the start of their relationship with Honda, and signing Alonso is a big one. The third is that Honda badly wanted him - the Japanese company have long been huge fans of the Spaniard. In tempting him away from Ferrari, McLaren-Honda have secured a magnificent driver, as his former colleague Rob Smedley can attest. Before joining Williams this year as head of performance, Smedley spent 10 years at Ferrari, gaining three years of first-hand experience of Schumacher and spending his final four years as Felipe Massa's race engineer, with Alonso on the other side of the garage. \\"Fernando is the very best driver of his generation,\\" Smedley says. \\"I would go so far as to say if not the best ever. He is that good. He brings that much performance to the team. I am a massive fan of his. \\"To have Fernando as your team-mate, as most people have found out - Kimi Raikkonen has certainly found out this year - is not easy. You are talking about very good drivers who sit beside him on the other side of the garage. I don't think there is anyone in this paddock who could live with him.\\" On the day of the row in Hungary, McLaren's then managing director Martin Whitmarsh tried to persuade Dennis to sack Alonso immediately - before that weekend's race. Yet, some years later, Whitmarsh admitted he did not at that point have all the relevant information and when he did, he was more understanding - if not forgiving - of Alonso's actions. The issue at the heart of the problems within McLaren all that year was Alonso's demand for the team to focus their title challenge on him, rather than split their efforts by giving team-mate Lewis Hamilton equal status. That was true to McLaren's long-stated ethos. But Whitmarsh later discovered that when Dennis signed Alonso he had indeed promised him priority status, only to go back on his word. As for Dennis, when he was asked about Alonso's behaviour following the FIA's punishment of McLaren, he said, almost admiringly: \\"Competitive animals know no limits.\\" It was Whitmarsh, who became team principal at McLaren in 2009, who started the process that has led to Alonso rejoining the team. Whitmarsh approached Alonso as long ago as the summer of 2013 to make it clear he wanted him back. And the process of wooing him continued despite Dennis's ousting of Whitmarsh late last year. Whitmarsh's effective replacement, McLaren's racing director Eric Boullier, has been instrumental in convincing Alonso that he has a better chance of winning the elusive third title he craves at McLaren than at Ferrari, even though their competitive positions in 2014 suggest otherwise. Part of Boullier's sales pitch has centred on Honda. The Japanese company and McLaren are intent on reviving the glory days of their original relationship a quarter of a century ago, when with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost they won four drivers' titles in a row from 1988-91. Alonso, who has had a year of watching Ferrari's new turbo hybrid V6 engine pummelled into the ground by that of Mercedes, has been informed of Honda's progress and apparently been convinced that the Japanese engines have a better chance of taking on Mercedes than those from Maranello. Media playback is not supported on this device Equally, although McLaren's car has clearly been well behind the best in the past two years - and well off Ferrari's, too, for that matter - the team have been making changes. Specifically, these include the signing of aerodynamicist Peter Prodromou from Red Bull, where he was the right-hand man of design guru Adrian Newey on the cars that romped to four consecutive world titles from 2010-13. In three of those years a frustrated Alonso was second. There have been all sorts of rumours over the past few weeks about how exactly Alonso came to be leaving Ferrari two years before the end of his contract. But the man himself says that his intentions have never wavered. \\"In the summer, I took the decision,\\" he says. \\"I followed that direction and only time will tell whether it was a good one or a bad one.\\" Sources close to Alonso and Ferrari insist that is true. They say that he simply wanted to leave Ferrari, having lost faith that they would ever get into a position to challenge for the title within the timeframe of the years he has left at his peak - which, at 33, is probably only a handful more. Mercedes, where there is no seat open for 2015, were his first option; McLaren his second. Walk up and down the paddock and it is not hard to find people who will say Alonso is a disruptive influence and hard to handle, while, equally, there are also those who have worked closely with him who will barely say a bad word about him, and insist that he is \\"only as difficult as you allow him to be\\". But whatever Alonso's actions, they are based on his overwhelming will to win. He is desperate to win a third title, and with it the status he rightly feels he deserves in the F1 pantheon. He gives everything in his quest to achieve that and he expects his team to provide him with the equipment to do so. If there is going to be a problem between Alonso and McLaren in the next little while, its root will likely be there. Media playback is not supported on this device Alonso and Dennis have apparently buried the hatchet. But they will never be bosom buddies. After all, Dennis, a difficult and complex character, has fallen out with every good driver who has ever raced for him - Prost, Senna, Niki Lauda, Mika Hakkinen, Juan Pablo Montoya, Kimi Raikkonen, David Coulthard, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. But Dennis and Alonso will likely rub along well enough as long as things are going well, especially with Boullier acting as a buffer. The issue will be if they are uncompetitive. Alonso has gone to McLaren to win, and win big. Perhaps not next year, but sooner rather than later. If they don't deliver, or if they don't at least look like they are going to, the fall-out is unlikely to be pretty. Summary:","output":"A long time ago, a race car driver named Fernando Alonso joined a team called McLaren. They didn't get along very well and he left after just one season. Now, after seven years, Fernando and McLaren are teaming up again, hoping for a happier ending this time. Fernando Alonso is a very good driver and McLaren believes he can help them win.

Solve this math problem Solve -182*h + 4703 + 13705 = 5304 for h.","output":"To solve this equation for h, follow these steps: 1. Isolate the term \\"-182*h\\" on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 4703 from both sides:    -182*h + 4703 + 13705 - 4703 = 5304 - 4703    -182*h + 13705 = 601 2. Next, isolate the variable h by dividing both sides of the equation by -182:    (-182*h + 13705) / -182 = 601 / -182    -182*h / -182 = -601 / 182    h = -601 / 182 3. Simplify the fraction -601 / 182:    h = -601 / 182    h = -301/91 (when dividing both numbers by the greatest common divisor 2) 4. Express the result as a mixed fraction:    h = -3 38/91 (when dividing 301 by 91 to get integer quotient 3 and remainder 38) So the solution to the equation is h = -3 38/91."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"Contractors, owners hit by Day's demise\\"","output":"Title: Contractors, owners hit by Day's demise Once upon a time, there was a company called Day. Day was a big company with lots of workers and they helped build things like houses and buildings. They had friends, called contractors and owners, who they worked with. One sad day, the Day company stopped working because of something called \\"demise.\\" This means that the company had to close down and couldn't make any more houses or buildings. Imagine if a toy store you really liked closed, and you couldn't buy the toys from there anymore. That's what happened to the people who worked with Day. The contractors, who are like the helper friends in building things, started to feel sad and worried. They were not sure if they could find new friends to work with, like Day, to help them build houses and buildings. They were also worried they wouldn't have enough money to buy things like food and toys for their families. The owners, who are the people that want the new houses and buildings, were also sad and worried. They had been waiting and saving their money for a long time to get their new homes and offices, but now Day wasn't there to help them anymore. They had to look for other companies to help them build their dream spaces. Everyone realized that when a company like Day goes away, it doesn't just affect the people who worked there. It also affects the friends who worked with them, like contractors and owners. So, people in the town started to talk about ways to help those friends find new people to work with, so they could build houses and buildings again. In the end, the story teaches us that when something big happens, like a company closing down, it can create challenges for lots of people. But by working together and finding new friends who can help, the contractors and owners can still build their beautiful houses and buildings, and make the world a better place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Speaking at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, the Democratic nominee said her time off was a gift, allowing her to reflect on the campaign. She walked on stage to the sound of James Brown's I Feel Good to deliver a speech on the economy. Polls indicate a tightening White House race, with 54 days to election day. Mrs Clinton's return comes a day after her doctor said she was \\"healthy and fit\\". A history of US presidential bad health She told a boisterous crowd at Thursday's rally: \\"With just two months to go until election day, sitting at home was pretty much the last place I want to be.\\" \\"People accuse me of all kinds of things,\\" she added, \\"you probably have seen that, but nobody ever accuses me of quitting and I will never give up, I'll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets.\\" The 68-year-old said she felt \\"lucky\\" that she could afford to take a few days off, compared with the millions of Americans who could not. At a brief press conference afterwards, Mrs Clinton was asked whether she had shared details of her pneumonia diagnosis with her running mate, Tim Kaine. She appeared to parse her words carefully as she replied that \\"many senior staff knew and information was provided to a number of people\\". \\"This was an ailment that many people just power through,\\" she continued, \\"and that's what I thought I would do as well.\\" She then jetted off to a give a speech at an event in Washington DC. The race has focused on both candidates' state of health and medical records in recent days. As countless thousands of armchair physicians looked on, Hillary Clinton took to the campaign trail for the first time since her near-collapse on Sunday. It was a speech where \\"optics\\" mattered at least as much as what she said. Did she look healthy? Was her voice strong? Aside from a bit of hoarseness, Mrs Clinton hit her marks - a sharp contrast from the wobbly figure helped into a van on Sunday. If she keeps this up, her health concerns will likely recede into the background. Perhaps more notably from a strategic perspective was Mrs Clinton's humbler, more personal tone. She admitted her faults, but said one of her strengths was never quitting. Early on, she pivoted from talking about her illness to the struggles of Americans who can't afford quality healthcare. Although she took swipes at Donald Trump, she only referred to him as \\"my opponent\\". As she told the press after her speech, she wants to give Americans \\"something to vote for, not just against\\". Her campaign has relentlessly bashed Mr Trump over the past months, but she seems to be acknowledging that this alone may not be enough to win her the presidency. On Thursday, Donald Trump released a letter from his doctor saying he is in \\"excellent physical health\\", albeit overweight. The Republican nominee earlier this year released a brief memo from the same physician asserting he would be \\"the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\\". The 70-year-old businessman also discussed his health with Dr Mehmet Oz during a taped episode of the medical chat show, which aired on Thursday. At a rally in Ohio on Wednesday, Mr Trump used Mrs Clinton's recent health scare to cast doubt on her stamina. He said: \\"I don't know folks, do you think Hillary Clinton would be able to stand up here for an hour?\\" On Sunday, she  had to be helped into a van after abruptly leaving the World Trade Center memorial after aides said she felt \\"overheated\\".

The group barely made it through the fight: This indicates that the challenge was tough, and they had a hard time overcoming it. The group's struggle contributed to the narrator's frustration and disappointment, as they were likely hoping for a smoother gaming experience. 2. Undergeared puggies: The narrator mentioned that many of their teammates were undergeared, which suggests that their equipment and abilities were inadequate for the level of difficulty they were facing. This could have put more pressure on the narrator to perform better and compensate for the weaker players, which in turn might have caused them further stress and dissatisfaction. 3. Difficulty with Leotheras the Blind battle: While the fight against Leotheras the Blind went better for the narrator, they still ran into issues, such as not getting the whirlwind attack. Although they managed to kill their demon relatively quickly the first time, the fact that they struggled with some aspects of the fight further compounded their feelings of frustration. 4. The second demon killed the narrator: In the game, players often aim to stay alive and deal damage or provide support to their team effectively. The fact that the narrator died due to the second demon could be seen as a failure on their part. This would be especially frustrating if the rest of their team did not suffer a similar fate. 5. Lack of healing: The narrator mentioned that they received no heals during the encounter with the second demon, which ultimately led to their death in the game. This could signify a lack of support or teamwork from their fellow players, which can be upsetting and demoralizing for someone who is invested in group cooperation and success. In summary, the narrator was upset while playing the game due to a combination of factors, including a challenging fight, undergeared teammates, issues with their own performance, and a perceived lack of support from their group. Together, these factors contributed to a negative gaming experience, leaving the narrator feeling frustrated and disappointed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Oystein Aarseth (Norwegian: ['oystein 'os@t]; 22 March 1968 - 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian guitarist. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete. In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, and between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene.  On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Toyengata in Oslo. Upon their arrival a confrontation began and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds - two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.  It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at \\"outdoing\\" the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: \\"If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me\\". He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous \\"panicked\\" and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Faust and other members of the scene.  According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time\\". Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, \\"I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Oystein\\". Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a \\"defense [...] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]\\".  Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \\"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\\". Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.  At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's then-drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album. Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: \\"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did\\". The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.  A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used 'Satan' to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers \\"have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death\\". A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said \\"There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop\\". After his death, a new generation of musicians tried to gain credibility by 'hyping-up' Euronymous, although he was also hailed as \\"the King\\" or \\"Godfather of Black Metal\\" by bands that had emerged before this new generation. However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates \\"speak of the killing with a tone of indifference\\". Lords of Chaos remarks: \\"what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another\\". In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: \\"It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences\\". He added: \\"I think many people felt relief once he was gone\\". Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying \\"Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone\\".  The book Lords of Chaos says of Euronymous:  He was always dressed in black from head to foot, his hair dyed black for added effect. He sported long, aristocratic mustaches and wore knee-high boots. His black leather biker jacket was decorated with badges [...] When talking, he seemed stern and serious, sometimes with pomposity verging on the theatrical\\".  In interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. In a 1993 interview he said \\"There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted\\". Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985 and considered him to be his best friend) said that Euronymous \\"was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme\\". Ihsahn, who frequented Helvete, said that \\"if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted\\" there, which was important to be a part of the Helvete scene.  However, Lords of Chaos claims that many who knew Euronymous say \\"the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that - a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality\\". They include Kjetil Manheim, Vikernes and Blackthorn. Faust said that with Euronymous, \\"there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire\\". When asked why Euronymous made such extreme statements to the press, Ihsahn said: \\"I think that was very much to create fear among people\\". He added that the scene \\"wanted to be in opposition to society\\" and \\"tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy\\". Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim (who was friends with Euronymous from 1983 until his death) described Euronymous as \\"blond, health oriented, very good at school. He worked-out a lot, didn't smoke, didn't drink ... That was the Oystein we knew. A nice guy, a family guy ... But when we weren't around he could play out his role\\". Manheim claimed that Euronymous became \\"extreme\\" towards the end of his life: \\"He liked telling people that they were worthless; [that] he was the best. He was all 'I define black metal. Black metal is me!' ... I think he was trapped in the image of Mayhem. He became a megalomaniac\\". In the documentary Pure Fucking Mayhem he said \\"Oystein's daily life was a total theater\\" that was based on the black metal \\"archetype\\" of 'Euronymous'.

Q:This article: The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04, known officially as the British National Antarctic Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism.  The expedition discovered the existence of the only snow-free Antarctic valleys, which contain Antarctica's longest river. Further achievements included the discoveries of the Cape Crozier emperor penguin colony, King Edward VII Land, and the Polar Plateau (via the western mountains route) on which the South Pole is located. The expedition tried to reach the South Pole travelling as far as the Farthest South mark at a reported 82°17′S.

Summarize this article: Knitting on your arms uses the same basic technique as knitting with needles. However, it can be more challenging at first since you will be using your fingers to create the new stitches.  To knit the first row, take the free end of the yarn (set the tail aside) and loop that yarn around your hand. Then, insert this loop into the first loop on your right arm. As you pull the loop through, slide the old loop off your right arm and slide the new loop onto your left arm.  Continue to knit the stitches in this way until you reach the end of the first row. As you knit using your arms, you will be transferring the stitches from one arm to the other. That means that if you started on your right arm, then you will be transferring the stitches over to your left arm by the end of the first row, and then back to your right arm by the end of the second row. Continue knitting until you have achieved the desired length. You will need to bind off the stitches to finish the blanket. As with knitting using needles, you will be casting off by knitting the first two loops and then pulling each loop through the one that is behind it.  For example, start by knitting the first two loops in your row. Then, stop knitting and grasp the first loop in your row with your fingers. Pull this loop up and over the second loop on your hand so that it is secured and you only have one loop on your hand. To continue casting off, follow the pattern of knitting one and looping the first loop over the second loop until you reach the end of the row. As you cast off, you should never have more than two loops on your casting off arm. After you have cast off the final loop, pull the free end of the yarn through the loop. Then, weave the tail end of the yarn through the loops on the edge of the blanket to hide it.  You can also tie the end of the yarn in a knot going through one of the stitches to secure it. Trim off any excess yarn from the tail and your blanket is complete! Summary:","output":"Arm knitting uses the same technique as needle knitting but can be more challenging initially as fingers are used to create stitches. To start, loop yarn around your hand and transfer loops between arms to create rows. Continue knitting until desired length is achieved. Bind off stitches to finish the blanket by casting off, following a pattern of knitting one and looping the first loop over the second until the end of the row. After casting off the final loop, secure the yarn and trim excess. This method is an alternative to traditional knitting and can be used to create items like blankets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Dialogue:  W: Have a look at our new jeans, please. They've just arrived and they are on sale.  M: Uh.. Thanks. I will let you know if I need help.  Question: What's the woman's job?   - A librarian.  - A shop assistant.  - A secretary. A:","output":"The woman's job is a shop assistant. The dialogue indicates two individuals, a woman (W) and a man (M), interacting in a specific setting. The woman suggests the man, 'Have a look at our new jeans, please,' noting that the jeans are recently arrived and on sale. Her reference to 'our new jeans' suggests that she works in the environment where the jeans are being sold since she aligns herself with the products by using 'our.' The phrase 'they've just arrived' further supports this as it implies that part of her role includes keeping track of stock, merchandise arrivals and promoting the products to the customers. This act of promoting goods to customers or suggesting items strongly hints towards retail work.  Furthermore, the protocol she maintains in handling the customer, his interests or intentions, such as when the man mentions 'I’ll let you know if I need help,' this hands-off but available response echoes typical retail employee behaviour where customers are allowed the freedom to browse products but help is readily available if needed.  In consideration of these factors, it would be reasonable to deduce that the woman is a 'shop assistant'. A shop assistants' job typically includes tasks such as handling transactions, greeting customers, answering customers' questions about merchandise and products, restocking shelves, promoting current sales to customers, and keeping track of what is in stock. On the flip side, it is improbable she would be a 'librarian' or a 'secretary' based on the context of the dialogue. The role of a librarian typically involves managing collections of books and periodicals, assisting customers including helping them locate reading materials or with other information needs and they do not sell clothes. Similarly, a secretary typically manages administrative duties in an office setting, including managing appointments, answering phone calls, handling office correspondence, and assisting other staff; activities which the woman in the dialogue is not engaging in.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Next, we need to perform the \\"look right thrice\\" action. This means we need to look to the right three times. We can break down this command into three separate \\"look right\\" actions.    a. For the first \\"look right\\", the action is: I_LOOK_RIGHT.    b. For the second \\"look right\\", the action is: I_LOOK_RIGHT.    c. For the third \\"look right\\", the action is: I_LOOK_RIGHT.

It is slowly revealed that one of the men is suffering from losing his wife. The other man had just experienced a domestic disturbance with his girlfriend's father. The woman, covered in blood, just left the hospital after visiting her grandmother. The movie opens with Karl visiting his wife's grave. His young daughter shows up with Karl's sister-in-law and they play Marco Polo for a while. He asks his sister-in-law to care for his daughter so he can take care of something. He drives home where the blackout traps him. During flashbacks we see him taking photos of a woman whom he later buys a drink and takes to his car. Claudia is a student who lives with her grandmother. Her grandmother advises to relax and enjoy life. The story opens with Claudia covered in blood, leaving a hospital for home.

In fact, the vast majority of Uberwald's population consists of ordinary humans, werewolves, dwarves, trolls, and other diverse creatures. To assume that someone is a vampire solely based on their accent is a gross generalization and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. It is important to recognize and challenge such assumptions, as they contribute to the marginalization of individuals from various backgrounds and promote the rampant spread of misinformation. This can lead to discriminatory behavior and limit opportunities for those who are unjustly labeled as something they are not. Now, let us analyze the situation from which this dialogue is taken. It appears to revolve around a negotiation for employment, wherein an individual is offered a dollar a day as a starting salary. Cut in here the interjection of another character exclaiming that the potential employee is a vampire. This character, Sacharissa, is then rebuked by the hidden Otto, who challenges the basis of Sacharissa's assumption. What is evident from this exchange is the detrimental effect of stereotypes on daily interactions. In this case, Sacharissa's assumptions about Otto being a vampire based on his accent potentially hinder his chances of being employed fairly, reflecting on how such misconceptions can negatively affect one's career prospects and social life. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. People from different backgrounds and cultures often face similar situations, where their abilities and intentions are judged based on inaccurate, predetermined ideas about their origins. It is crucial for everyone to recognize the impact of these stereotypes and actively work towards dismantling them. One way to dismantle such stereotypes is to educate ourselves about the diverse cultures and traditions of the world. By gaining knowledge about the richly diverse populations of different regions, we can learn to appreciate and respect the variety of people we encounter in our everyday lives. Another helpful strategy is to practice empathy and understanding when dealing with people from different backgrounds. By placing ourselves in their shoes, we can better understand the difficulties they may face due to stereotypes and prejudice and foster a more inclusive and open-minded environment. Furthermore, it is essential to call out such instances of discrimination when we observe them, whether in our personal lives or in the media. By openly addressing these issues, we can create a platform for constructive debate and discourse, allowing us to challenge and ultimately break down the harmful stereotypes that persist. In conclusion, the dialogue presented highlights the damaging consequences of stereotypes associated with someone's origin or accent. It is vital for us to recognize and combat these issues through education, empathy, and open discussion. By doing so, we can cultivate a more inclusive and accepting society where every individual is judged based on their abilities and character, rather than prejudiced assumptions founded on their background."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington The sinking of the USS Eagle PE-56 was first deemed an accident until new evidence established it had been hit by a German submarine. Its location remained a mystery until June 2018, when the ship was found five miles (8km) off the coast of Maine. The Eagle lay 300ft (91m) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. \\"This particular wreck was one of those conversations: 'wouldn't it be great if we could?'\\" said Ryan King, a member of the eight-person dive team. But as Mr King began looking into the mystery-shrouded ship, finding the Eagle soon became something he \\"had\\" to do. \\"It's one of those wrecks that just gets under your skin,\\" said Mr King. \\"If it's not you, who else is looking?\\" He and seven other divers combed the seabed for the ship for four years before it was found - 69 years after it sank to the bottom of the Atlantic, killing 49 of the 62 crew members on board. They eventually teamed up with Gary Kozak, a specialist in undersea searches. Mr Kozak pointed the group towards several \\"targets\\" - possible GPS coordinates where the ship could be. On a dive in June last year, two of the divers swam upon a \\"big wall of steel\\" at the bottom of the ocean. \\"That wall turned out to be the Eagle PE-56,\\" Mr King said, adding that he felt \\"just absolute awe\\" and that locating the ship was a team effort. For the rest of the summer the group returned to the wreck, taking around 20 additional dives and gathering the evidence needed to prove the sunken ship was the missing Eagle. They worked closely with Robert Neyland, who leads the underwater archaeology branch of the Naval History and Heritage Command. Mr Neyland and his team manages the approximately 3,000 American shipwrecks and 15,000 naval aircrafts worldwide. It would take the team under four minutes to dive to the wreck, with water temperatures plunging below 40F (4C). Ascents would last up to three hours so divers could avoid decompression sickness. This particular warship, designed by Henry Ford for WWI, was the only Eagle boat lost during combat. Its sinking was initially blamed on a boiler explosion, despite accounts from surviving crew members, who said they had spotted a German submarine before their ship sank. In a rare move, the Navy overturned its initial ruling after declassified German documents confirmed that the Eagle had been hit by a torpedo. The sinking was changed to a combat loss and all of the Eagle's crew members were posthumously awarded a Purple Heart for their service. \\"History was rewritten,\\" Mr Neyland said. The discovery is invaluable recognition for the crew of the Eagle \\"for having their ship shot at beneath them\\". This fall, the Smithsonian Channel will air its documentary \\"Hunt for Eagle 56\\", chronicling the discovery by Mr King and the diving team. \\"As soon as we found the wreck we really wanted to get this story told,\\" Mr King said. \\"Not our story, the story of the Eagle.\\" \\"Our hope was just to put it on a map,\\" he added. \\"To put it to rest.\\"","output":"The USS Eagle PE-56, initially deemed lost by accident, was discovered off the coast of Maine after evidence confirmed it was sunk by a German submarine during WWII."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Who was the captain of the US Ryder Cup team in 2010?","output":"In 2010, the captain of the United States Ryder Cup team was Corey Pavin. Corey Pavin is a professional golfer from the United States, born on November 16, 1959, in Oxnard, California. Pavin earned his reputation as an outstanding golfer over his long career, which began when he turned professional in 1982. Corey Pavin is best known for his success on the PGA Tour, where he claimed 15 victories between 1984 and 2006. Arguably, his most notable triumph came in the 1995 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, where he secured his one and only major championship title. Pavin made a name for himself with his relentless work ethic, determination, and ability to excel under pressure, which made him an ideal candidate for the Ryder Cup captaincy. The 2010 Ryder Cup took place at Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales from October 1st to 4th. As the captain of the U.S. team, Pavin was responsible for selecting the 12 players who would represent their country in one of golf's most prestigious events. The team consisted of a combination of experienced players and young talents, with a few notable names being Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, and Dustin Johnson. As captain, Pavin was responsible for determining the playing order and pairings for the various matches, as well as overseeing team strategy and offering support to the players. Despite his best efforts, the U.S. team was defeated by the European team, led by captain Colin Montgomerie, with a final score of 14.5 to 13.5. While the 2010 Ryder Cup was a disappointment for Pavin and the United States, it does not detract from his impressive golf career and his tenure as captain. Since the Ryder Cup, Corey Pavin has continued to play golf, participating in both PGA and Champions Tour events, while also providing commentary and analysis for various golf broadcasts. His leadership in 2010, along with his overall contributions to the sport, solidifies his place as a significant figure in American golf history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you're trying to identify a song simply using a melody, it is first important to consider how much of that melody you actually remember. Every little bit of information helps, and will increase the likelihood that a friend will be able to pinpoint the song for you.  Being a more attentive listener throughout your music-listening habits will make future scenarios like this much easier to grapple with.  Take care to make sure that all of the information you think you remember is actually right. The memory can be a strange thing, and a few botched notes in your melody can lead your helper completely astray. Choosing the right person to help you has a lot to do with what you currently remember of the song itself. If you distinctly remember the song's melody chances are you'll know the genre as well. Many people prefer certain genres over others, and the ones that tend to listen to the genre of the song in question will subsequently have the highest chance of successfully helping you out. Enlisting the help of friends with formal musical training is helpful too, as they are used to identifying music purely on the basis of melody. Find somewhere non-distracting and relatively quiet; that way, there won't be uncontrolled factors hindering the process. Sit down with your friend and recreate the melody for them, whether with your voice or the piano. Take care to accurately reproduce the cadence and rhythm of the melody as well-- melody entails far more than a simple sequence of notes! While you can technically recreate the melody on just about any musical instrument, it's actually recommended you try doing it with your voice. Especially if you're not a trained musician yourself, the human voice offers a lot of potential for expression. In singing the melody, you might be able to get some of the timbre and tone across as well, making your approximation that much more specific. Giving your helper some context as to the tone, rhythm and general style of the song can help them pinpoint a song just as well as any melody. Part of what you're doing is trying to give them an accurate impression inside their head as to the song. That way, they'll have an easier time to pinpointing it. Many melodies can be used by multiple songs, so providing a little bit of context can go a long way towards helping identifying the song in question. Now that you've given them the melody, you and your friend can brainstorm as to what it's about. Encourage them to ask you questions about the song. It is possible you still remember more than the information you've offered them. Give another hum to the melody once the two of you have discussed it a little bit, and see if either of you approach it any differently. While you're talking and humming the melody, you should remain open to the possibility that you'll remember the song yourself, provided it's something you've forgotten as opposed to trying to identify it from scratch. If the first person you ask isn't successful, you should try getting help from other people. In the case of identifying a melody, in most cases it's a simple matter of having it click instantly. What ends up leading to the brainstorming stage for some people may be an instant bid for others. Don't lose hope if you can't get it right the first time; find someone new, and begin the process again. Summary:","output":"To identify a song using its melody, follow these steps: 1. Recall as much of the melody and genre as possible, and be attentive when listening to music in the future. 2. Choose the right person to help you, preferably someone familiar with the genre and with some musical training. 3. Find a quiet, non-distracting place to recreate the melody, either using your voice or a musical instrument. 4. Accurately reproduce the cadence, rhythm, and overall style of the melody. 5. Provide context to your helper, including tone, rhythm, and general style of the song. 6. Brainstorm with your friend and encourage them to ask you questions about the song. 7.

Question: Where was the group that was behind making the first carpets for furnishing? Context: The art of carpet weaving was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters. The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and kilims not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.","output":"The group that was behind making the first carpets for furnishing originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia.

Use the Big Dipper to tell time.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding the Skies: Spotting the Big Dipper, Finding the North Star, and Telling Time  One of the charms of stargazing is how it places us in a universe beyond our everyday circumstances. While many stars randomly sparkle in the night sky, some of them form definite patterns that have guided explorers and inspired poets. Particularly noteworthy among these patterns is the constellation known as the Big Dipper, and a star so constant, it's aptly named the North Star. In this article, we will delve into details about spotting the Big Dipper, finding the North Star, and using the Big Dipper to tell time. Firstly, spotting the Big Dipper is an exciting beginning in the world of astronomy. Though its difficulty level varies based on your location and season, there are a few tricks to ease out the process. Predominantly observable from the Northern Hemisphere, the Big Dipper, also known as Ursa Major or the Great Bear, looks like a large ladle or wagon. It consists of seven bright stars forming the shape of a spoon - four for its bowl and three for its handle. The best time to view the Big Dipper is from late winter to early spring, but it can be seen in the northern latitudes year-round. It rotates counter-clockwise around Polaris (the North Star), thus appearing in different places at different times of the night. Beginners might find it helpful to start their viewing session around 9 pm. The constellation appears high in the sky, away from city lights, rising in the east and setting in the northwest. The second part of this celestial navigation journey involves identifying the North Star or Polaris. In earlier centuries, sailors or travelers relied on the North Star as a wonderful navigation tool. Polaris' near alignment with Earth's axis causes it to remain nearly stationary, always shining in the northern sky regardless of the observer's location or time of night. Finding the North Star using the Big Dipper is relatively straightforward due to the convenient position of both in the sky. The two stars forming the outer lip of the Dipper's bowl, called Dubhe and Merak, are known as the Pointer Stars. If you draw an imaginary line connecting these two stars and extend it roughly five times the distance between them, you would point directly at Polaris. It is the brightest star in the vicinity along this line. Finally, given the Big Dipper's circular journey around the North Star due to the rotation of the Earth, it behaves like a celestial clock, helping observers tell the time. This aspect of the Big Dipper has fascinated countless skywatchers, from ancient China to American railroad builders. This natural clock's 'hour hand' is an imaginary line drawn from the center of the celestial sphere to the center of the Big Dipper's bowl.  Initially, get accustomed to determining the position of the Big Dipper at 9 pm each night. With practice, you will be able to track its movement and anticipate where it should be later in the night. For instance, if at 9 pm, the Big Dipper stands upright with the handle on the bottom, six hours later, it will be upside down on the other side of Polaris. Simple math will allow you to work in reverse and determine the time based on its position. Thus, the heavens offer a fascinating spectacle for those who take a moment to observe them. With the Big Dipper as your guide, you not only get introduced to the vast world of space but also learn to appreciate the beauty and consistency of nature's clock. So, the next time you glance up at a clear night's sky, take a moment to locate this constellation and witness the ancient art of celestial navigation and time-telling unfolding right above you."},{"instruction":"Q:Not exactly. I have no problem with divorce since, as others have stated, everyone has their reasons, however there was one person that I dated briefly but upon hearing the reason why he divorced I opted to end the relationship. I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? “Oh Definitely.” Oh good! So at least he regrets his actions, right? Or he’s at least a little sorry about it> Wrong. “One of the reasons I regret not divorcing her sooner. Had I divorced her sooner, I wouldn’t have to have cheated on her so much. But it is what it is and, well, I was unhappy.” I have no problems with divorced men. I can forgive a man who has cheated in his past. But a man who had no problems cheating so frivolously and, in all honestly, would likely do it again without problems? Nope, not for me.

Write an article based on this summary: Activists campaigning for greater support for victims of domestic violence have released smoke flares and lain across the red carpet at the premiere of the film Suffragette.","output":"Title: Activists Bring Light to Domestic Violence at the Suffragette Premiere Introduction During the premiere of the film Suffragette, activists put on a powerful and compelling demonstration to raise awareness about domestic violence and the need for greater support for its victims. The protesters, campaigning for increased recognition and resources for the plight of victims, displayed a powerful symbol of their message by releasing smoke flares and laying across the red carpet. This act demonstrated the resilience and courage of those that want to change the status quo. This article explores the motivations behind this protest, its implications, and the responses it garnered from the audience and the public, both in a broader context and in relation to the Suffragette film. Background Suffragette, the film that served as the stage for the poignant display, chronicles the early days of the British women's suffrage movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The issue of domestic violence is a prominent aspect explored in the movie, as it highlights the importance of granting women rights and power over their own lives. The premiere, taking place in the heart of London's West End, attracted an audience of A-list celebrities and public figures, making it an ideal platform for activists to convey their message to the world. The Protest: Actions and Motivations Activists from the organization Sisters Uncut chose this premiere as the backdrop for their protest because of the contemporary relevance domestic violence still holds in society today. These protesters, dressed in black, laid down on the red carpet while emitting smoke flares, creating a chilling visual. The smoke, symbolizing the distress calls and the dire situations faced by victims, was a call-to-action for society to recognize the seriousness of this issue. Lying across the red carpet symbolized the barriers and struggles faced by victims in attempting to seek help and justice, often feeling trapped and silenced. Their primary motivation was to emphasize the need for increased support from governments, communities, and individuals in addressing domestic violence. The protesters demanded better funding for services, such as shelters and counseling programs, that catered to the victims. They also used the event to showcase the significance of creating stronger legal frameworks in ensuring that the voices of victims are heard in courts and their abusers brought to justice. Reception and Impact The protest garnered immense media coverage and public attention, with many onlookers offering their support and sharing their thoughts on social media. The film's cast and crew, including Meryl Streep, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne-Marie Duff, addressed the protest positively, stating that the Suffragette movement was an ongoing fight for women's rights, and they were proud that their film could inspire such strong and passionate activism. While some criticized the method of protest as disruptive, many more applauded the activists' courage and commitment to raising awareness about the emotional, psychological, and physical impact of domestic violence on its victims. Overall, the protest succeeded in sparking a renewed conversation around the issue, bridging the fight of the suffragettes over a century ago with the ongoing struggle for gender equality and women's rights in today's world. Conclusion The powerful protest carried out by Sisters Uncut on the red carpet of the Suffragette premiere was more than a mere display of activism; it was a poignant reminder of the continuing challenges faced by victims of domestic violence and the urgent need for an increased support system on all levels. It revitalized the dialogue around domestic violence, the necessity for intervention, and the unyielding collective power required to bring about change. Ultimately, the protest demonstrated that the spirit of the Suffragette film extends beyond the screen, inspiring action and courage in the ongoing fight for women's rights and gender equality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Franco-Prussian War On 18 August, the battle began when at 08:00 Moltke ordered the First and Second Armies to advance against the French positions. By 12:00, General Manstein opened up the battle before the village of Amanvillers with artillery from the 25th Infantry Division. But the French had spent the night and early morning digging trenches and rifle pits while placing their artillery and their mitrailleuses in concealed positions.

The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase. Q: Article: Language is always changing. In a society where life continues year after year with few changes, the language does not change either. The earliest known languages had difficult grammar but a small, limited vocabulary. Over the century, the grammar changed, and the vocabulary grew. For example, the English and Spanish people who came to America during the sixteenth century gave names to all the new plants and animals they found. In this way, hundreds of new words were introduced into English and Spanish vocabularies. Today life is changing very fast, and language is changing fast too. There are several major  language families in the world. Some scientists say there are nine main families, but other scientists divide them differently. The languages in each family are connected, and scientists think that they came from the same parent language. About 3 percent of the people in the world speak languages that are not in these major families.

While the UK voted for Brexit, 74.4% of those who cast their ballots in the Scottish capital were in favour of remaining. Driving through the capital, making stops along the way to talk to people, there were no visible signs in the streets or in gardens of how people felt about the vote. There were no flags, banners or groups of kilted men as there had been in the hours after the Scottish referendum result in 2014. However, everyone wanted to talk about the referendum result. Alice Cook, 41, a teacher who lives in Portobello, said she was \\"worried and scared\\" by the result. \\"This is a disaster. I am devastated.

First, we have a math problem that looks like this: -177 * r - 191 * r + 2932 = -1875 - 3657 Our hero is r, and we need to help r find its way home. Step 1: Let's help r by combining friends that look the same. We have -177 * r and -191 * r.  If you add them together, it looks like this: (-177 - 191) * r = -368 * r Now the problem looks easier: -368 * r + 2932 = -1875 - 3657 Step 2: Let's make friends on the right side of the \\"=\\" sign happy.

To do this, you can subtract 2932 from both sides, and you get: -368 * r = -8464 Step 4: Almost there! Now we just have to set r free by dividing both sides by -368: r = -8464 / -368 Now, if you divide the numbers, you find that r finally finds its home at: r = 23 And that's the end of our math story!

It was founded in 1674 by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a warrior king, who established a strong rule in the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau regions. The Maratha Empire expanded significantly throughout India during the 17th and 18th centuries, and its capital city was initially located at Raigad and later shifted to Pune. During its peak, the Maratha Empire served as a prominent power in the Indian subcontinent, with influence stretching from the Deccan plateau and Western Ghats to territories like Attock in present-day Pakistan, and covering most of present-day India. After the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Maratha Empire was severely weakened and ultimately ceased to be a major power, with the various Maratha states operating autonomously until they were subsumed under British colonial rule during the 19th century."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: A Massachusetts woman who slashed her two children's throats before dousing them with lighter fluid and setting fire to their apartment was sentenced Friday to 20 to 25 years in prison. Tanicia Goodwin, 27, of Salem, pleaded guilty to armed assault with intent to murder, arson and other charges during a hearing in Salem Superior Court. The mother of two was ordered to not have contact with any children, including her own, 8-year-old Jamaal and 3-year-old Erica. Justice: Tanicia Goodwin, 27, pleaded guilty Friday at Salem Superior Court to armed assault with intent to murder, arson and other charges in connection to a March 2012 attack on her children. Authorities said firefighters responding to the blaze in March 2012 discovered that vents and sprinklers in the apartment had been covered and the front doorknob had been removed. Goodwin then went to the police station and told authorities, 'I'm sorry, babies. I did what I had to do to protect my children,' prosecutors said. Both children survived and are now living with relatives. They did not attend the sentencing. Prosecutors said Jamaal and Erica still suffer emotionally from the aftereffects of the attack. When given the chance to speak, Ms Goodwin told Judge James Lang that she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and is now on medication that makes her thoughts 'more clear.' Her lawyer, Denise Regan, said Goodwin grew up in abusive and neglectful conditions and was only 8 or 9 years old when she began receiving treatment for mental illness. Lang said Goodwin's actions were shocking. 'I'm frankly at a loss for words, really, to articulate the heinous nature of what occurred here,' Lang said. Heinous crime: Goodwin has admitted to slashing the throats of her 8-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter, dousing the wounded children with lighter fluid and then setting their apartment on fire. Assistant District Attorney Melissa Woodward said Goodwin attacked 8-year-old Jamaal as he was watching a movie on television and eating a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch for dinner, telling him that he had lived too long and cutting his throat so deep his trachea was exposed. Goodwin then told Jamaal to give a goodbye hug to his little sister, who was lying in a pool of blood after having her neck slashed, Woodward said. The mother then doused both children with lighter fluid, set a fire and at some point had cut her own neck. 'This was by all accounts a double murder with a pitiful feigned suicide attempt by the defendant,' Woodward said. On March 18, 2012, a responding firefighter found Goodwin naked and wet outside her smoking apartment, according to police reports. Jamaal was sitting inside against a wall, covered in lighter fluid and struggling to breathe through the hole in his throat. Erica was bleeding and abandoned on a neighbor's couch. Heartbreaking: After the attack on her children, Goodwin went to the police station and told authorities, 'I'm sorry, babies. I did what I had to do to protect my children' Goodwin, meanwhile, walked barefoot to the Salem police station and allegedly told officers she'd hurt her children to protect them. In her cell that night, she continuously repeated, 'I'm sorry, my babies,' according to a police report. Goodwin's cousin Wayne Cox is currently raising Jamaal in Atlanta, while Erica is being raised by her biological father. Cox told prosecutions for an impact statement presented in court Friday that Jamaal does not let anyone touch his throat, will not zip coats past his collar and is afraid to play outside alone, reported the Boston Herald. Although the boy is an honor student, he is very anxious. And every time he sees a listing on TV for 'Men from Mars' he says, 'This is the movie that was on when mom cut me.'

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

Do you remember how you feel when you can't find your favorite toy and you think someone took it? That's what happened to an employee during a holiday weekend. This employee had a special computer, called a laptop, which had important information about many people on it. Someone took it when they weren't looking, and that's not very nice!

It's called \\"layers of security and encryption.\\" That might sound like a fancy new superhero power, but it's a smart way the army uses to keep important information safe. So even if someone tried to look at the things on the laptop, it would be very hard to do! The army is like a helpful friend who helps out when we need them. After the laptop was stolen, they sent a letter to the people whose information was on that laptop. It took two weeks for the letters to reach them, but there was a good reason for that. The army needed to do a \\"risk assessment,\\" which is like when we look both ways before crossing the street. They had to make sure it was safe before they sent the letters.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - She has recorded with Yellow Magic Orchestra and its members Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, as well as with Swing Out Sister, Pat Metheny, The Chieftains, Lyle Mays, members of Little Feat, David Sylvian, Mick Karn, Kenji Omura, Gil Goldstein, Toninho Horta, Mino Cinelu, Jeff Bova, Charlie Haden, Peter Erskine, Anthony Jackson, David Rhodes, Bill Frisell, Thomas Dolby, the band Quruli, Rei Harakami as yanokami and her daughter Miu Sakamoto.  - Biography.

Article: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed.

Article: Research has long backed the therapeutic   value of diary-keeping for teenage girls and boys.But according to a new study, when teenagers detail their sadness onto a blog, the therapeutic value is even greater.Blogging, it seems, can be good for you. The study, published in the journal Psychological Services and conducted by Meyran Boniel-Nissim and Azy Barak, psychology professors at the University of Haifa, Israel, found the contact with an online community through a blog made it more effective in relieving the writer's social anxiety than a private diary would be. To track teenagers' experiences with blogging, the researchers randomly surveyed high school students in Israel and selected 161 of them who exhibited some level of social anxiety or stress.The teenagers, who averaged 15 years old, said they had difficulty making new friends or relating to their existing friends. The teenagers were divided into six groups.The first two groups were asked to blog about their social difficulties, with one group asked to open their posts to comments.The second two groups were asked to blog about whatever struck their adolescent fancy; again, with one group allowing comments.All four groups were told to write in their blogs at least twice a week.As a control, two more groups were told to keep either an old-fashioned print diary or to do nothing at all. All of their blog records were then read through by four psychologists to determine the authors'   social and emotional state.In all the groups, the greatest improvement in mood occurred among those bloggers who wrote about their problems and allowed commenters to respond. Interestingly, the commenters on the blogs were quite supportive.\\"The only kind of surprise we had was that almost all comments made by readers were very positive and constructive in trying to offer support for anxious bloggers,\\" Dr.Barak wrote in an e-mail.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Q: What kind of change causes evolution in population?   A: The answer is:","output":"Evolution in a population is primarily driven by changes at the genetic level, which in turn affect the phenotypes, or physical traits, of individuals within that population. There are several key factors and processes that contribute to this genetic change and, ultimately, evolution in a population. Some of these factors include genetic mutations, gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection, and sexual selection. Each of these processes plays a crucial role in shaping the genetic composition of a population and driving evolution.  1. Genetic mutations: Genetic mutations are random changes in an organism's DNA sequence. These alterations can occur for a variety of reasons, such as DNA replication errors, exposure to radiation, or the influence of certain chemicals. Mutations can result in new alleles (versions of a gene) that may confer advantages or disadvantages to an individual, depending on the environment. Over time, mutations accumulate in populations, providing the raw material for evolution to occur. 2. Gene flow: Gene flow, also known as migration, occurs when individuals from one population move to another population, bringing their unique genetic material with them. When gene flow occurs, it can introduce new alleles into a population or alter the frequency of existing alleles. This process helps to maintain genetic diversity between populations and can lead to the evolution of new traits in response to environmental pressures. 3. Genetic drift: Genetic drift is a random process that involves changes in the frequency of alleles within a population due to chance events. This phenomenon can cause significant shifts in allele frequencies over time, particularly in small populations where random fluctuations have a greater impact. Genetic drift can lead to the loss of genetic diversity as certain alleles become more common while others are eliminated. Over time, this process can contribute to the evolution of new characteristics or the loss of beneficial traits. 4. Natural selection: Natural selection is the process by which individuals with traits that are well-suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals with less favorable traits. This results in the gradual accumulation of advantageous traits in a population, leading to the evolution of new characteristics. Natural selection operates on the principle of \\"survival of the fittest,\\" favoring those who are better equipped to cope with environmental challenges. 5. Sexual selection: Sexual selection is a specific form of natural selection that occurs when individuals choose mates based on certain traits. This can result in the preferential reproduction of individuals with specific features, ultimately leading to the evolution of these traits within a population. Sexual selection can be driven by factors such as physical attractiveness (i.e., colorful plumage in birds), strength, or the ability to provide resources. This process can lead to the evolution of traits that are not necessarily beneficial for survival but are attractive to potential mates. In summary, evolution in a population is driven by various factors and processes that cause changes at the genetic level. These changes can occur through genetic mutations, gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection, and sexual selection, each playing a crucial role in shaping the genetic composition of a population. Over time, the interaction of these processes leads to the evolution of new traits and adaptations, enabling populations to better survive and thrive in their environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Through warming or other methods a chunk is taken off the glacier - The chunk drifts into the sea - And it settles where it can remain in its state - It is considered an iceberg. The answer is:","output":"The answer is: Identify a suitable glacier. Step-by-step justification: Step 1: Identify a suitable glacier. - In order to obtain a chunk from a glacier, we first need to find a suitable glacier that has the potential to produce icebergs. This typically involves researching and surveying regions with glacial activity, such as areas near the poles or in high-altitude environments. Step 2: Through warming or other methods, a chunk is taken off the glacier. - After a suitable glacier has been identified, the process of calving, where a chunk breaks off from the glacier, can occur naturally due to factors such as glacier movement, rising temperatures, or the presence of meltwater. Alternatively, external forces (e.g., tidal waves or human intervention) can also contribute to the process. Step 3: The chunk drifts into the sea. - Once detached from the glacier, the ice chunk, now commonly referred to as an iceberg, begins to drift away and enters the sea. The iceberg is carried by ocean currents, which dictate its distribution and movement. Step 4: It settles where it can remain in its state. - The iceberg eventually settles in an area where the environmental conditions, such as ocean temperature and current, are conducive to maintaining its solid state. This often means that it stays in colder waters or regions with lower temperatures. Step 5: It is considered an iceberg. - Once the ice chunk has separated from the glacier, entered the sea, and settled in a suitable location, it is officially classified as an iceberg. From this point, it remains a part of the ocean's ecosystem until it eventually melts or breaks apart."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How to decide on whether to get a rowing machine for home exercise  Select equipment that will provide physical exercise.  A rowing machine should not produce boredom and the type of machine chosen should have minimal risk of injury and be easy to use.  Understand the extent of a workout that is gained by using a rowing machine :  Aerobic benefits: the rowing machine stimulates the heart and lungs.  1. Cardiovascular benefits: the rowing machine stimulates blood flow to the heart. It provides a greater means of oxygen, so it is almost a necessity for doing a cardiovascular workout.; 2. The machine does not keep you confined inside a machine for prolonged periods of time. Cardiovascular benefits: cardiovascular benefits are apparent more closely in a water workout than from a traditional rowing machine.; 3. Low blood pressure: the heart pump releases blood glucose and regulates the heartbeat. Cardiovascular benefits: the rowing machine connects the heart to the lungs by pumping it with adrenaline.; 4. The stimulation is reached through the specific intensity and continued level of the exercise being taken. The levels needed for this aerobic workout is contingent upon the age and health of the person who is exercising.;","output":"5. Muscle strengthening and toning: rowing machines provide an excellent full-body workout, targeting a variety of muscle groups such as the legs, core, arms, and back. This leads to increased strength, muscle definition, and overall body conditioning. 6. Low impact exercise: as opposed to high impact exercises like running, rowing machines provide a low-impact option that is easier on the joints, reducing the risk of injury while still providing an effective workout. To decide whether to get a rowing machine for home exercise, consider the following factors: 1. Space availability: Rowing machines can require a significant amount of space, especially when in use. Ensure you have enough room in your home to accommodate the machine, and consider whether it can be easily stored when not in use. 2. Budget: Rowing machines vary greatly in price, depending on the type, features, and brand. Consider your budget and what you are willing to spend on a machine that meets your exercise needs. 3. Fitness goals: Determine if a rowing machine aligns with your fitness goals. Are you looking to improve cardiovascular health, strengthen and tone muscles, or lose weight? Analyze the benefits listed above and evaluate if a rowing machine can help you achieve your desired outcomes. 4. Motivation: Home fitness equipment can be convenient, but it could also become easy to neglect when out of sight or out of mind. Think about whether you are self-driven enough to stay motivated to use the machine consistently. 5. Personal preference: Some individuals enjoy the sliding motion and rhythm of rowing, while others may find it repetitive or uncomfortable. Consider trying out a rowing machine at a fitness center or gym before purchasing one for home use to ensure it is an exercise you enjoy and can adhere to long-term. 6. Equipment reviews and quality: Research different rowing machine brands and models, as well as their features and specifications. Reading customer reviews can provide insight into the durability, ease of use, and overall satisfaction with the product. 7. Noise levels: Some rowing machines can be loud and disruptive to other members of the household. Take into consideration noise levels and whether your living situation allows for a louder or quieter machine. By evaluating these factors and weighing their importance to your specific needs and goals, you can make an informed decision about whether a rowing machine would be a suitable addition to your home exercise routine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This could be looked at in many different ways. This movie sucks, its good or its just plain weird. The third one probably explains this movie best. It has strange themes and just has a strange plot. So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be. The acting was what you would expect especially out of Ben Stiller. Jack Black I have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the wall. He is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy wise it is somewhat funny. This of course meaning that it does have its moments (though very few) but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way. The directing was average as well. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here. This movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it. Just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film. The writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously that means the writing here failed. At best it is below average. Considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible. That is never a good thing to say about a movie though.  If not for Christopher Walken and it stupid ridiculous ending I would have given it a lower rating. He is always quite a character in his movies. Stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere. Not completely horrible but I would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie. Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?

One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet. The next day I couldn’t apply any pressure and couldn’t walk at all. I was dirty and smelly and needed some serious help on my leg but I was too far from any civilization.

Based on the sentence \\"Two men are standing on what seems to be a bridge.\\", is the sentence \\"Two men were standing in a barren field.\\" a true sentence?","output":"The sentences \\"Two men are standing on what seems to be a bridge.\\" and \\"Two men were standing in a barren field.\\" describe two different scenarios, therefore, it is not accurate to say that the second sentence is a true sentence based on the first one. Here's a detailed analysis of the two sentences to support this conclusion: 1. Different time references: The first sentence, \\"Two men are standing on what seems to be a bridge.\\", is in the present tense. This indicates that the men are currently standing on the bridge at the time of observation or description. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Two men were standing in a barren field.\\", is in the past tense. This suggests that the occurrence happened in the past and the men are no longer standing in the field. The change in time reference already signals a difference between the two situations described by the sentences. 2. Different locations: In the first sentence, the location indicated is a bridge (or what seems to be), while in the second sentence, the location described is a barren field. These are two distinct environments. A bridge usually serves as a structure built over a physical obstacle, such as a river or valley, often to provide passage for transportation or commuters. A barren field, on the other hand, implies a vast, empty piece of land with little to no vegetation or structures. 3. Different context: The context of the first sentence might lead to interpretations of various situations, such as the two men having a conversation on a bridge or observing the scenery around them. In the second sentence, the scene is quite different, as the men are standing in a barren, likely desolate field. The context in which these men are positioned in these sentences conveys different meanings for both situations. To conclude, based on the differences in time references, locations, and context mentioned above, it is not accurate to consider \\"Two men were standing in a barren field.\\" a true sentence based on \\"Two men are standing on what seems to be a bridge.\\" The two sentences describe different scenarios, and as such, one cannot be regarded as true or false based on the other."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},W={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],R={key:0},E={key:1};function D(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",W,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
