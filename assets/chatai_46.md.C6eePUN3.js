We need to find the first 10 natural numbers that have an odd number of divisors. 2. Notice that a natural number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. This fact stems from the property that divisors come in pairs; if a number is a perfect square, it has a divisor that repeats itself (the square root), leading to an odd count of divisors. 3. Perfect squares up to and including the 10th perfect square are calculated as follows: [ 1^2 = 1, ] [ 2^2 = 4, ] [ 3^2 = 9, ] [ 4^2 = 16, ] [ 5^2 = 25, ] [ 6^2 = 36, ] [ 7^2 = 49, ] [ 8^2 = 64, ] [ 9^2 = 81, ] [ 10^2 = 100. ] 4.

This is because divisors come in pairs, and the only number that repeats itself as a divisor in such pairs is the square root of a perfect square. 2. **Proof**:    - Let ( n ) be a natural number.    - If ( n ) is a perfect square, say ( n = k^2 ), then the divisors of ( n ) occur in pairs ( (d, frac{n}{d}) ), where ( d ) is a divisor of ( n ). The exception is the divisor ( k ), which appears only once. Consequently, the total count of divisors is odd.    - Conversely, if ( n ) has an odd number of divisors, then pairs of divisors ( (d, frac{n}{d}) ) imply one divisor must repeat twice. This can only happen if ( n ) is a perfect square because ( k^2 = n ) implies ( k ) is a unique divisor appearing twice.    - Therefore, ( n ) has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square.

Let E and F be the midpoints of the bases, and P and Q be the midpoints of the diagonals. Since P and Q are equidistant from the bases, they lie on the midline of the trapezoid. 2. **Diagonals in a Circumscribed Circle**: The diagonals of a trapezoid are chords of the circumscribed circle, so their perpendicular bisectors pass through the center of the circle, K. Given that P and Q are on the perpendicular bisectors of the diagonals and are equidistant from the bases, the quadrilateral PKQM is a square because all sides PM and QM are equal and the angles are all right angles. 3. **Midpoints and Distances**: Let L be the midpoint of PQ.

Let's assume R_2 < R_1 and the radius O_2L makes an angle varphi with the line O_1O_2. Drawing a line through L parallel to O_1O_2 intersects the circle centered at O_1 at points K_1 and K_2. Correspondingly, there are two rectangles: K_1LMN_1 and K_2LMN_2. 5. **Varying varphi:**    As varphi changes from 0 to pi/2, the angle psi (between radius O_1K_1 and line O_1O_2) varies from 0 to some value psi_0. As varphi changes from pi/2 to pi, psi decreases back to 0. The centers of the rectangles K_1LMN_1 trace a segment from the midpoint of CD to the midpoint of BC, excluding the endpoints, as well as the intersection point of this segment with the common chord.    Similarly, the centers of the rectangles K_2LMN_2 fill the interval from the midpoints of AB and AD (excluding endpoints and the intersection point). 6. **Three vertices on one circle:**    If three vertices of the rectangle lie on one circle, the fourth vertex must also lie on that circle. Consequently, the center of the rectangle coincides with the center of the corresponding circle. # Conclusion: The required geometric locus of the centers of rectangles with vertices on the given circles is the union of three intervals: - The interval between the midpoints of AB and AD. - The interval between the midpoints of BC and CD. - Excluding the middle points and endpoints of these intervals and point of intersection with the common chord of the circles. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Suppose x, y, and z are positive numbers satisfying: begin{align*} x^2/y &= 4,  y^2/z &= 9, text{ and}  z^2/x &= 16. end{align*} Find the value of x.","output":"First, rewrite the equations to express y and z in terms of x: 1. y = x^2/4 2. z = y^2/9 = (x^2/4)^2/9 = x^4/144 Now, use these expressions in the third equation: [ z^2/x = 16 ] [ (x^4/144)^2/x = 16 ] [ x^7/20736 = 16 ] [ x^7 = 16 times 20736 = 331776 ] [ x = sqrt[7]{331776} ] To simplify sqrt[7]{331776}: [ 331776 = 2^{14} ] [ x = sqrt[7]{2^{14}} = 2^{2} = 4 ] Thus, x = boxed{4}."},{"instruction":"John had a stock of 1400 books in his bookshop.

We can do this by using the percentage of books that were not sold. The percentage of books not sold is 71.28571428571429%, so we can calculate the number of books not sold by multiplying this percentage by the total stock of books: Number of books not sold = 71.28571428571429% of 1400 Number of books not sold = 0.7128571428571429 * 1400 Number of books not sold ≈ 998 (rounded to the nearest whole number) Now, we need to find out how many books were sold in total. We can do this by subtracting the number of books not sold from the total stock of books: Total books sold = Total stock of books - Number of books not sold Total books sold = 1400 - 998 Total books sold = 402 We know the number of books sold on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

We know that Jon drinks 728 ounces of fluid a week, and we need to subtract the amount he gets from the larger bottles to find out how much he drinks from the regular bottles.

Consider a quadrilateral ABCD inscribed around a circle. This means that the circle is tangent to all four sides of the quadrilateral. Let P, Q, R, and S be the points of tangency on AB, BC, CD, and DA respectively. 2. We can denote the tangents from each vertex using these points of tangency. Specifically, for vertex A, the tangents to the circle are AP and AS; for vertex B, the tangents are BP and BQ; for vertex C, the tangents are CQ and CR; for vertex D, the tangents are DR and DS. 3. According to the properties of tangents from a common external point, we have the following equalities:    [    AP = AS, quad BP = BQ, quad CQ = CR, quad DS = DR    ]        This ensures that (AP + AS) + (BP + BQ) + (CQ + CR) + (DS + DR) = AB + BC + CD + DA. 4. To show that the lines connecting the tangency points intersect on the extension of a diagonal or are parallel to it, we consider the following configuration and theorems: 5.

To show that PQ or RS must intersect in a meaningful configuration, let's assume another tangency connection like PS and QR.

Introduce a coordinate system by aligning the x-axis along the first ray. Let the first vector mathbf{e}_1 be represented as (1, 0, 0). 3. Assume that subsequent vectors in this coordinate system are denoted as mathbf{e}_k = (x_k, y_k, z_k) for k geq 2. 4.  5. Since all angles between these vectors are obtuse, the scalar product between any two distinct vectors must be negative. Consider:    [    mathbf{e}_1 cdot mathbf{e}_k = (1, 0, 0) cdot (x_k, y_k, z_k) = x_k < 0    ]    This implies that x_k < 0. 6. We can normalize these vectors by assuming x_k = -1. Therefore, for the vectors mathbf{e}_k = (-1, y_k, z_k) and mathbf{e}_2 = (-1, y_2, 0), their scalar product will be:    [    mathbf{e}_2 cdot mathbf{e}_k = (-1, y_2, 0) cdot (-1, y_k, z_k) = 1 + y_2 y_k < 0 Rightarrow y_2 y_k < -1    ] 7.

From y_3 y_4 > 0, it follows that z_3 z_4 < -1. Distinct negative values are not possible for more than one pair sharing the same sign. 10. By considering all combinations mathbf{e}_1, mathbf{e}_2, mathbf{e}_3,..., we notice that creating five vectors keeping all scalar products negative is not possible in 3D since the conflict arises in maintaining negative scalar products beyond four vectors without breaking the condition. 11.

There are two scenarios in which player B can take the second shot: 1. Player A takes the first shot and misses. 2. Player B takes the first shot and makes it. Given that player A has a shooting percentage of 0.6, the probability of missing is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. Similarly, player B has a shooting percentage of 0.8, so the probability of making the shot is 0.8. Since the player for the first shot is determined by drawing lots, each player has a probability of 0.5 of taking the first shot. Therefore, we can calculate P as follows:  P = 0.5 times 0.4 + 0.5 times 0.8 = 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6  Thus, the probability that player B takes the second shot is boxed{0.6}.  Part 2: Probability that Player A Takes the i-th Shot Let P_n be the probability that player A takes the n-th shot. The probability that player A takes the (n+1)-th shot can be determined by considering two scenarios: 1. Player A takes the n-th shot and misses. 2. Player B takes the n-th shot and misses. Given the shooting percentages, we can express P_{n+1} as:  P_{n+1} = 0.6P_{n} + 0.2(1 - P_{n}) = 0.4P_{n} + 0.2  To find a general formula for P_n, we notice that:  P_{n+1} - frac{1}{3} = 0.4(P_{n} - frac{1}{3})  Given that P_1 = 0.5 (since player A has a 0.5 probability of taking the first shot), we find:  P_{1} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6}  This implies that {P_{n} - frac{1}{3}} forms a geometric sequence with the first term frac{1}{6} and common ratio 0.4. Therefore:  P_{n} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1}  Solving for P_{n} gives us:  P_{n} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1}  Therefore, the probability that player A takes the i-th shot is boxed{P_{i} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1}}.  Part 3: Expected Number of Times Player A Shoots in the First n Shots From Part 2, we know that P_{i} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1}. To find the expected number of times player A shoots in the first n shots, denoted as E(Y), we sum up the probabilities for i from 1 to n:  E(Y) = sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{i} = frac{1}{6} sum_{i=1}^{n} left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1} + frac{n}{3}  The sum of a geometric series is given by frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Applying this formula, we get:  E(Y) = frac{frac{1}{6}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}]}{1 - frac{2}{5}} + frac{n}{3} = frac{5}{18}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}] + frac{n}{3}  Therefore, the expected number of times player A shoots in the first n shots is boxed{E(Y) = frac{5}{18}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}] + frac{n}{3}}, for n in mathbb{N}^{*}."},{"instruction":"James was doing some shopping and saw an offer on shoes that give him a second pair of shoes for half off the original price.

Therefore, to uniquely identify an (n)-sided polygon, we must:    - Provide (2n - 3) elements.    - Ensure at least (n - 2) of those elements are sides. # Conclusion:  Thus, the number of elements required to uniquely identify each polygon are: - For triangle: ( 3 ) elements including at least ( 1 ) side. - For quadrilateral: ( 5 ) elements including at least ( 2 ) sides. - For an ( n )-sided polygon: ( 2n - 3 ) elements including at least ( n - 2 ) sides.

Since ( a ) and ( b ) are both greater than 1, we can write ( a = d cdot x ) and ( b = d cdot y ), where ( d = gcd(a, b) ). Therefore, ( a^n = (d cdot x)^n ) and ( b^n = (d cdot y)^n ). Since ( a^n mid b^n ), it follows that ( (d cdot x)^n mid (d cdot y)^n ). This implies ( x^n mid y^n ), and since ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, ( x mid y ).

Show that ( A, T, X ) are collinear.","output":"Given the problem, we start by noting the geometric relationships involving the incircle and excircle of triangle ( triangle ABC ). 1. **Dilation Argument**:     - Consider a dilation centered at ( A ) which maps the incircle of ( triangle ABC ) to the excircle opposite ( A ). Let's denote this dilation as ( mathcal{D} ). 2. **Transformation of Points**:     - A key property of dilation is that it scales distances by a fixed ratio and angles remain unchanged. Therefore, the incircle is transformed into a larger (excircle) with the same center configurations.     - The point ( D ), where the incircle touches ( BC ), is transformed to a similar point on the excircle, which we denote as ( D' ). 3. **Transformation of Diameter**:     - Let ( D ) be the point of tangency of the incircle with ( BC ), and ( T ) be the point diametrically opposite to ( D ) on the incircle.     - Under the dilation ( mathcal{D} ), the diameter ( DT ) of the incircle is mapped to a corresponding diameter of the excircircle. Since diameters are scaled lengths along the same line, ( T ) must transform to a point ( T' ) on the excircle such that ( AT' ) passes through a similar configuration as ( ADT' ). 4. **Identification of Points on the Excircle**:     - The diameter of the incircle ( DT ), being a line perpendicular to ( BC ), must transform to a diameter of the excircle that is also perpendicular to ( BC ).     - The only such significant diameter through the excircle would correspond to ( ADX ), passing through ( X ) (where ( X ) is the contact point of the excircle on ( BC )). 5. **Collinearity Argument**:     - Since the line ( AD ) under the dilation ( mathcal{D} ) transforms to another line that runs through ( A ), ( T ) transforming to ( X ) establishes the path of collinearity.     - Therefore, the image point ( T' ) must be ( X ), implying that ( A ), ( T ), and ( X ) are collinear. **Conclusion**: By the properties of dilation and the specific geometric configuration given, we infer that the points ( A ), ( T ), and ( X ) are collinear: [ boxed{textrm{A, T, X are collinear.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let [mathbf{B} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  1 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix}.] Compute (mathbf{B}^{150}).","output":"First, we compute the first few powers of (mathbf{B}): [ mathbf{B}^2 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  1 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  1 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1  1 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}, ] [ mathbf{B}^3 = mathbf{B} mathbf{B}^2 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  1 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1  1 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix} = mathbf{I}. ] Since (mathbf{B}^3 = mathbf{I}), every third power of (mathbf{B}) returns to the identity matrix.

Thus, we only need to consider positive integers (d) without square factors. 2. Let us test the simplest case where (d = 1) and (k = 15).

Therefore, when (d = 1), the condition is satisfied. 3. We now consider the case where (d > 1). In any sequence of the form (d, 2d, cdots, kd), any two consecutive terms sums being divisible by (d) results in a quadratic number ((dq_i)^2):    [    (m + n)d = left(dq_iright)^2    ] 4.

When y > 8, both factors are positive, hence their product is also positive. Therefore, the inequality (y - 8)(y + 2) > 0 holds when y < -2 or y > 8.

A: {v}_{2}=frac{ab}{a+b} B: a < {v}_{2} < sqrt{ab} C: sqrt{ab} < {v}_{1} < sqrt{frac{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}{2}} D: v_{1} > v_{2}","output":"To analyze the given problem, we'll break down the solution into detailed steps for each option, following the information provided: **Option A:** Given that the distance from the first floor to the fifth floor is s, we can express the arithmetic mean of the speeds a and b as {v}_{1}=frac{a+b}{2}. The average speed for the entire journey, {v}_{2}, can be calculated using the total distance covered (which is 2s, up and down) divided by the total time taken (time up plus time down). This gives us {v}_{2}=frac{2s}{frac{s}{a}+frac{s}{b}}=frac{2ab}{a+b}. Therefore, option A, which suggests {v}_{2}=frac{ab}{a+b}, is incorrect because our calculation shows {v}_{2}=frac{2ab}{a+b}. Hence, boxed{text{Option A is incorrect}}. **Option B:** Given 0 < a < b, we can deduce that a+b < 2b, leading to frac{2b}{a+b} > 1. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us frac{2b}{a+b}-1 > 0. Multiplying both sides by a (which is positive), we get a(frac{2b}{a+b}-1) > 0, which simplifies to frac{2ab}{a+b} > a. Also, since a+b > 2sqrt{ab} (by the AM-GM inequality, since a neq b), we have frac{2ab}{a+b} < sqrt{ab}. Combining these inequalities gives us a < frac{2ab}{a+b} < sqrt{ab}, which confirms that boxed{text{Option B is correct}}. **Option C:** For option C, we start by noting that sqrt{ab} < frac{a+b}{2}, which is true by the AM-GM inequality since a neq b. To compare frac{a+b}{2} and sqrt{frac{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}{2}}, we examine the squares of these expressions. We find that {(sqrt{frac{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}{2}})}^{2}-{(frac{a+b}{2})}^{2}=frac{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}{2}-frac{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}+2ab}{4}=frac{(a-b)^{2}}{4} > 0. This implies that sqrt{frac{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}{2}} > frac{a+b}{2}, confirming that boxed{text{Option C is correct}}. **Option D:** To compare {v}_{1} and {v}_{2} directly, we note that left(a+bright)^{2}-4ab=left(a-bright)^{2} > 0, which implies left(a+bright)^{2} > 4ab. Dividing both sides by 2(a+b) gives frac{a+b}{2} > frac{2ab}{a+b}, which means {v}_{1} > {v}_{2}. Therefore, boxed{text{Option D is correct}}.

Therefore, point C' lies on AD.    - We have:      [      AE = CE = C'E      ]    - Given these, we can conclude the following:      [      DF = frac{DC' + DA}{2} = frac{DC + DA}{2}      ]    - Also, by definition, DF = DE cdot cos(angle FDE). 4. **Deduce Key Angle Properties:**    - Since OE is a diameter, Thales' theorem tells us that:      [      angle ODE = angle OAE = 90^circ      ]    - Knowing that internal and external angle bisectors are perpendicular, angle ODE = 90^circ implies OD is the external bisector at D. 5. **Distance To The Bisector:**    - Let G be the perpendicular projection of B onto OD.    - Use triangle similarity (because B, O, and E are collinear), this implies:      [      frac{BG}{BO} = frac{DE}{OE}      ]    - From the symmetry and similarity, we get:      [      BG = frac{BO}{OE} cdot DE = frac{AO}{OE} cdot DE = cos(angle AOE) cdot DE = cos(angle FDE) cdot DE = frac{DC + DA}{2}      ] 6. **Conclusion:**    - We have shown that the distance from point B to the external angle bisector of angle ADC is indeed the arithmetic mean of AD and DC:      [      boxed{frac{DA + DC}{2}}      ]"},{"instruction":"f ( k=2 ), then (left(k^{3}8right)(k+1)) equals (A) 0 (B) 3 (C) 6 (D) 8 (E) 6","output":"1. **Substitute ( k = 2 ) into the expression:**    [    (k^3 - 8)(k + 1)    ]    becomes:    [    (2^3 - 8)(2 + 1)    ] 2. **Calculate ( 2^3 - 8 ):**    [    2^3 = 2 times 2 times 2 = 8    ]    So,    [    2^3 - 8 = 8 - 8 = 0    ] 3. **Calculate ( 2 + 1 ):**    [    2 + 1 = 3    ] 4. **Substitute these values into the expression:**    [    (2^3 - 8)(2 + 1) = 0 times 3    ] 5. **Perform the multiplication:**    [    0 times 3 = 0    ] # Conclusion: (boxed{0}), which corresponds to option (A)."},{"instruction":"a modified sequence of numbers, the first number is 1, and for all n geq 2, the product of the first n numbers in the sequence is (n+1)^3.

The term containing xy^7 from (x+y)^8 will come from the possible combination of 1 instance of x and 7 instances of y, which according to the binomial coefficient is given by: [ binom{8}{1}x^1y^7 = 8xy^7 ] Therefore, the coefficient of xy^7 is 8. Similarly, the term containing x^2y^6 from (x+y)^8 will come from the combination of 2 instances of x and 6 instances of y, which is: [ binom{8}{2}x^2y^6 = 28x^2y^6 ] Hence, the coefficient of x^2y^6 is 28.

Let k be the smallest natural number for which x^k equiv 1 pmod{p^alpha}. According to the problem, we need to establish that x is a primitive root modulo p^alpha. This means that k should be equal to varphi(p^alpha) where varphi is the Euler's totient function. 2. By Euler's theorem, if x is primitive root modulo p, we must have k divides varphi(p^alpha). 3. Recall that varphi(p^alpha) = p^{alpha-1}(p-1). Therefore, we have:    [    k | p^{alpha-1}(p-1)    ]    This result is from basic number theory, particularly problem 31.12 in our reference.  4. Given the problem, it follows clearly that x^k equiv 1 pmod{p}. This implies that k must divide p-1, because the order of x modulo p must divide varphi(p) = p-1. 5. Therefore, we can write k as:    [    k = p^beta (p-1)    ]    for some non-negative integer beta with 0 leq beta leq alpha-1. 6. Suppose, for contradiction, that beta leq alpha - 2. Thus, we consider the expression x^{p^beta(p-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p^alpha}. 7. By raising both sides of the congruence x^{p^beta(p-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p^alpha} to the power p^{alpha-2-beta}, we get:    [    (x^{p^beta(p-1)})^{p^{alpha-2-beta}} = x^{p^{beta + (alpha-2-beta)}(p-1)} = x^{p^{alpha-2}(p-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p^alpha}    ]    However, this result contradicts the given condition x^{p^{alpha-2}(p-1)} notequiv 1 pmod{p^{alpha}}. 8. Therefore, our assumption beta leq alpha - 2 must be wrong. Thus, we conclude that beta = alpha - 1. 9. Consequently, k = p^{alpha-1}(p-1). 10. This value of k matches varphi(p^alpha), thus showing x is a primitive root modulo p^alpha, as required by our problem statement. # Conclusion: [ blacksquare ]"},{"instruction":"There are 1000 toy bears in a row.

We consider a regular ((2k + 1))-gon, meaning a  ((2k+1))-sided polygon where all sides are of equal length and all interior angles are equal. **2. Label the vertices systematically:** - We choose an arbitrary vertex and label it as ( A_1 ). - Then we proceed to label subsequent vertices following a specific sequence. Let ( A_2 ) be the vertex that is ( k )-vertices clockwise from ( A_1 ), and ( A_3 ) be the vertex that is ( k )-vertices clockwise from ( A_2 ), and so on, continuing in this manner around the polygon. **3. Establish the sequence for subsequent vertices:** Using this method of labeling, the sequence of vertices will follow the pattern: [ A_1, A_{1+k}, A_{1+2k}, ldots, A_{1+ik}, ldots, A_{1+2k cdot k} ] **4. Demonstrate distinct labeling:** The numbers ( k ) and ( 2k+1 ) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). Consequently, the terms ( 1, 1 + k, 1 + 2k, ldots, 1 + ik, ldots ) take distinct values modulo ( 2k + 1 ), This ensures all vertices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) are labeled uniquely and each vertex will appear exactly once among the ( n ) vertices of the polygon. **5. Proof the triangles' properties:** Since each triangle such as ( triangle A_1A_2A_3 ), ( triangle A_2A_3A_4 ), and so forth forms within this regular ((2k + 1))-gon, each of these triangles is isosceles with two equal sides being derived from the equally spaced vertices along the circumference of the polygon. Each of these isosceles triangles ( triangle A_iA_{i+1}A_{i+2} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-2, n-1 ) has angles less than ( frac{pi}{2} ) (90 degrees) since all interior angles of a regular polygon with more than 3 sides are less than 180 degrees distributed evenly. Thus, each triangle within ( n )-triangles mentioned are acute-angled triangles. **Conclusion:** It is therefore true that for any odd ( n > 3 ), we can label points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) on a plane such that each set of three points out of ( n ) forms an acute-angled triangle.

The number 3 is not a factor of 35, so we need to find a multiple of 35 that is also a multiple of 3. The multiples of 35 are: 35, 70, 105, 140, 175, etc. We are looking for a multiple of 35 that is also divisible by 3. The first such number is 105, which is divisible by 3 (105 ÷ 3 = 35).

The formula for the area of a triangle is S_{triangle} = frac{1}{2}absin C, where a and b are sides, and C is the angle between them. For triangle BCD, we have: [S_{triangle BCD} = frac{1}{2}BC cdot CD cdot sin angle BCD = 4] 2. Substituting the given values BC = 2sqrt{5} and CD = 2, we get: [frac{1}{2} cdot 2sqrt{5} cdot 2 cdot sin angle BCD = 4] 3. Simplifying, we find: [2sqrt{5} cdot sin angle BCD = 4] 4. Solving for sin angle BCD, we obtain: [sin angle BCD = frac{4}{2sqrt{5}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}] 5. Using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1, we can find cos angle BCD: [cos^2 angle BCD = 1 - sin^2 angle BCD = 1 - left(frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}right)^2] 6. Calculating further, we get: [cos^2 angle BCD = 1 - frac{4 cdot 5}{25} = 1 - frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{5}] 7. Therefore, cos angle BCD = sqrt{frac{1}{5}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}. So, we have: [boxed{cos angle BCD = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}}] # Part 2: Finding the Length of Side AC 1. We know from the cosine rule that DB^2 = CD^2 + BC^2 - 2CD cdot BC cdot cos angle BCD. Substituting the given values and our result for cos angle BCD, we have: [DB^2 = 2^2 + (2sqrt{5})^2 - 2 cdot 2 cdot 2sqrt{5} cdot frac{sqrt{5}}{5}] 2. Simplifying, we find: [DB^2 = 4 + 20 - 8 = 16] 3. Therefore, DB = sqrt{16} = 4. 4. Since DB^2 + CD^2 = BC^2, and we have found DB = 4 and CD = 2, this confirms that angle BDC = 90^{circ}, making triangle ACD a right triangle. 5. Given that angle A = 30^{circ} in triangle ACD, and knowing that triangle ACD is a right triangle, we can deduce that AC is the hypotenuse and CD is one of the legs. In a 30^{circ}-60^{circ}-90^{circ} triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg. 6. Therefore, AC = 2 cdot CD = 2 cdot 2 = 4.

Given that the distance to the activity location is 12 km and A arrives 10 minutes (or frac{1}{6} hour) earlier than B, we can write the time difference equation based on their travel times. The time it takes to travel a certain distance is the distance divided by the speed, so we have: [ frac{12}{x} - frac{12}{1.2x} = frac{1}{6} ] This equation represents the difference in time it takes for both students to reach the destination.

Since the tickets for adults cost 60 cents (or 0.60) and for children 25 cents (or 0.25), we can write the second equation as:    0.60x + 0.25y = 140 Now we have a system of two equations with two variables: x + y = 280 0.60x + 0.25y = 140 To solve this system, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. We can multiply the first equation by 0.60 to help eliminate one of the variables: 0.60(x + y) = 0.60(280) 0.60x + 0.60y = 168 Now we have: 0.60x + 0.60y = 168 0.60x + 0.25y = 140 Subtract the second equation from the first: (0.60x + 0.60y) - (0.60x + 0.25y) = 168 - 140 0.60x + 0.60y - 0.60x - 0.25y = 28 0.35y = 28 Now divide both sides by 0.35 to solve for y: y = 28 / 0.35 y = 80 So, boxed{80}  children attended that day."},{"instruction":"the rectangular coordinate system (xOy), the line l: begin{cases} x=t  y= sqrt {3}t end{cases}(t is the parameter ), the curve C_{1}: begin{cases} x=cos theta  y=1+sin theta end{cases}(theta is the parameter ), and the curve C_{2} has the equation rho=2cos theta+2 sqrt {3}sin theta in the polar coordinate system with the origin O as the pole and the nonnegative semiaxis of x as the polar axis. 1.

How many different arrangements are possible (arrangements that can be obtained by rotating the circle are considered the same)?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    There are 8 girls and 25 boys arranged in a circle. We need to find the number of different arrangements where between any two girls, there are at least two boys. 2. **Fixing a Reference Point:**    To simplify the problem, we assume that one of the girls, say ( A ), is fixed at a point. This reduces the problem to arranging the other 7 girls and 25 boys in a line considering ( A ) as the starting point. By doing this, every rotation that results in the same sequence is considered identical.  3. **Ensuring Separation:**    To ensure that there are at least two boys between any two girls, we visualize each girl as taking her position along with the two boys right next to her. For example, if we denote girls by ( bigcirc ) and boys by ( times ), we have the constraint that every pair of adjacent ( bigcirc )'s must be separated by at least two ( times )'s. 4. **Forming Groups with Constraints:**    We can therefore group each ( bigcirc ) along with the two immediate ( times )'s next to her, excluding ( A ). Let's use ( oplus ) to represent the group ( bigcirc times times ). Thus, we will have:    [    underbrace{bigcirc times times}_{oplus} quad underbrace{bigcirc times times}_{oplus} quad cdots quad underbrace{bigcirc times times}_{oplus}    ]    These groups consume ( 3 times 7 = 21 ) spots because there are 7 ( bigcirc )'s and each ( bigcirc ) has 2 ( times )'s associated with it. 5. **Accounting for Positions:**    Including ( A ), the total spaces in the line become ( (8 + 25) = 33 ). Out of these 33 positions, 21 are already taken by these 7 groups (( oplus )). Thus, we have:    [    33 - 21 - 1 = 16    ]    Here the extra (-1) is because ( A ) already occupies 1 position, reducing the total available spots. 6. **Distributing the Remaining Boys:**    These remaining ( 16 ) positions can be occupied freely by ( 8 - 1 = 7 ) girls. This is a typical combination problem where we need to choose 16 available spots from the total positions to place 7 girls. This can be calculated using the combination formula ( binom{n}{k} ):    [    binom{16}{7}    ] 7. **Calculating Permutations:**    Each of these 7 girls can be permuted among the 7 positions. This can be achieved by ( 7! ) (since one girl ( A ) is fixed). Similarly, the 25 boys who are to be placed in the remaining positions can be permuted among themselves, giving ( 25! ) ways.

The feed condition can be expressed as:    [    160x + 40y leq 8000    ]    Simplifying the equation by dividing through by 40:    [    4x + y leq 200    ] In summary, the conditions are: [ begin{cases} 2x + y = 120  4x + y leq 200 end{cases} ]  Part (b): We need to represent these conditions graphically on the xy-plane. 1. **Graphing the line ( 2x + y = 120 ):**    - The x-intercept occurs when ( y = 0 ):      [      2x + 0 = 120 implies x = 60      ]      So, the point is ( (60, 0) ).          - The y-intercept occurs when ( x = 0 ):      [      2(0) + y = 120 implies y = 120      ]      So, the point is ( (0, 120) ).          Therefore, the line ( 2x + y = 120 ) passes through (60,0) and (0,120). 2. **Graphing the line ( 4x + y = 200 ):**    - The x-intercept occurs when ( y = 0 ):      [      4x + 0 = 200 implies x = 50      ]      So, the point is ( (50, 0) ).          - The y-intercept occurs when ( x = 0 ):      [      4(0) + y = 200 implies y = 200      ]      So, the point is ( (0, 200) ).          Therefore, the line ( 4x + y = 200 ) passes through (50,0) and (0,200). The region to the right of this line represents ( 4x + y leq 200 ). Graph these lines on the xy-plane to visualize the feasible region.  Part (c): We need to check if the following pairs (20 chickens, 80 chicks) and (30 chickens, 100 chicks) satisfy the conditions. 1. **Checking (20 chickens and 80 chicks):**    - Space Condition:      [      2(20) + 80 = 40 + 80 = 120 quad text{(satisfied)}      ]    - Feed Condition:      [      4(20) + 80 = 80 + 80 = 160 leq 200 quad text{(satisfied)}      ]    Therefore, the setup of 20 chickens and 80 chicks is feasible. 2. **Checking (30 chickens and 100 chicks):**    - Space Condition:      [      2(30) + 100 = 60 + 100 = 160 quad text{(not satisfied)}      ]          Therefore, the setup of 30 chickens and 100 chicks is not feasible.  Part (d): We need to determine the maximum number of chickens and chicks while respecting the space and feed constraints. 1. **Finding the Maximum Number of Chickens:**    - Solving the system of equations:      [      begin{cases}      2x + y = 120       4x + y leq 200      end{cases}      ]    - Solve the first equation for ( y ):      [      y = 120 - 2x      ]    - Substitute into the second inequality:      [      4x + (120 - 2x) leq 200      ]      [      4x + 120 - 2x leq 200      ]      [      2x + 120 leq 200      ]      [      2x leq 80      ]      [      x leq 40      ]    - When ( x = 40 ), substitute back to find ( y ):      [      y = 120 - 2(40) = 120 - 80 = 40      ]    Therefore, the maximum number of chickens is 40, and the corresponding number of chicks is also 40. 2. **Finding the Maximum Number of Chicks:**    - Set ( x = 0 ) (no chickens):      [      2(0) + y = 120 implies y = 120      ]    Therefore, the maximum number of chicks is 120, with no chickens. # Conclusion The solutions to the given parts are: 1.

For larger primes, consider the pairs of integers ( (x, y) ) such that ( 0 leq x, y leq lfloor sqrt{p} rfloor ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exist pairs ( (x_1, y_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2) ) such that:    [    x_1 - ry_1 equiv x_2 - ry_2 pmod{p}    ]    This implies:    [    (x_1 - x_2) equiv r(y_1 - y_2) pmod{p}    ]    Squaring both sides, we get:    [    p mid (x_1 - x_2)^2 + 5(y_1 - y_2)^2 = a^2 + 5b^2    ]    where ( a = x_1 - x_2 ) and ( b = y_1 - y_2 ). Since ( a, b < sqrt{p} ), we have ( a^2 + 5b^2 < 6p ). The possible cases are:    - If ( a^2 + 5b^2 = 5p ), then ( 5 mid a ) so ( p = b^2 + 5left(frac{a}{5}right)^2 ).    - If ( a^2 + 5b^2 = 4p ), then ( 2 mid a, b ) so ( p = left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 + 5left(frac{b}{2}right)^2 ).    - If ( a^2 + 5b^2 = 3p ), then:      [      2p = left(frac{a + 5b}{3}right)^2 + 5left(frac{a - b}{3}right)^2 = left(frac{a - 5b}{3}right)^2 + 5left(frac{a + b}{3}right)^2      ]      One of these must be an integer solution.    - If ( a^2 + 5b^2 = p ) or ( 2p ), we are done.    This completes the proof of Claim 1. 2. **Claim 2:** Given a number ( n ) which divides ( x^2 + 5y^2 ) for some integers ( x, y ), there exist integers ( a, b ) such that (frac{a^2 + 5b^2}{n} = 1) or (2).    *Proof:* Note that:    [    (a^2 + 5b^2)(c^2 + 5d^2) = (ac - 5bd)^2 + 5(ad + bc)^2    ]    If ( n mid x^2 + 5y^2 ), then any prime ( p mid n ) will have (-5) as a QR. Thus, we can find corresponding ( a_p, b_p ) with ( a_p^2 + 5b_p^2 = p ) or ( 2p ). Doing this for every prime (with multiplicity) and multiplying all of them together, we get:    [    2^k n = x^2 + 5y^2    ]    for some integers ( x, y, k ) with ( k geq 0 ). If ( k geq 2 ), then by mod 4 we will have ( 2 mid x, y ), reducing it to:    [    2^{k-2} n = left(frac{x}{2}right)^2 + 5left(frac{y}{2}right)^2    ]    We can do this until ( k leq 1 ), which completes the proof of Claim 2. 3. **Claim 3:** If ( n ) is good, then ( n mid x^2 + 5y^2 ) for some integers ( x, y ).    *Proof:* Since ( n ) is good, we can find integers ( a, b, c, x, y ) such that ( ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 = n ) and ( b^2 - 4ac = -20 ). Note that ( b ) is even, so let ( b = 2b_1 ). Then:    [    ac = b_1^2 + 5    ]    Thus:    [    an = a^2x^2 + 2ab_1xy + acy^2 = a^2x^2 + 2ab_1xy + b_1^2y^2 + 5y^2 = (ax + b_1y)^2 + 5y^2    ]    which proves the claim. 4. **Claim 4:** If ( n_1, n_2 ) are good, then so is ( n_1 n_2 ).    *Proof:* From Claim 3, ( n_1 mid x_1^2 + 5y_1^2 ) and ( n_2 mid x_2^2 + 5y_2^2 ), so:    [    n_1 n_2 mid (x_1^2 + 5y_1^2)(x_2^2 + 5y_2^2) = (x_1 x_2 - 5y_1 y_2)^2 + 5(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)^2    ]    By Claim 2, we can find ( i, j ) such that ( i^2 + 5j^2 = n_1 n_2 ) or ( 2n_1 n_2 ). In the former case, take ( (a, b, c, x, y) = (1, 0, 5, i, j) ), while in the latter case, take ( (a, b, c, x, y) = (2, 2, 3, frac{i - j}{2}, j) ). This completes the proof.

Given that each of the three people can choose any team from the four with equal probability, the total number of possible choices is 4^3 since each person has 4 choices and there are 3 people. To find the number of ways exactly two teams can be chosen out of the four, we first choose 2 teams out of 4, and then distribute the 3 people among these 2 teams. The number of ways to choose 2 teams out of 4 is {C}_{4}^{2}. After choosing 2 teams, there are 3 ways to distribute 3 people among these 2 teams such that each team is chosen at least once (i.e., 2 people choose one team and 1 person chooses the other team). Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve event A is {C}_{4}^{2} times 3.

This can happen in two scenarios: either the female fan chooses the German team, or one of the male fans does.

Let’s analyze this specific number. 3. **Positioning Card ( k )**:     - Eventually, a point will be reached where no card numbered greater than ( k ) will come to the top of the pile.     - When ( k ) appears at the top, the top ( k ) cards are reversed, placing ( k ) at the ( k )-th position in the stack. 4. **Fixed Position**:     - Once placed at the ( k )-th position, card ( k ) will not be displaced because:         - Any subsequent top card operations involving numbers less than ( k ) only rearrange the top portion of fewer than ( k ) cards.     - This contradicts the assumption that ( k ) appears infinitely often at the top because it remains fixed in the ( k )-th position. 5. **Conclusion from Contradiction**:     - Hence, the assumption that the operations never end must be false.     - Therefore, Eva’s operations must necessarily come to an end when the card numbered 1 appears at the top of the pile. 6. **Alternative Solution Using Points**:     - Assign points to each card according to their position: let a card numbered ( k ) at the ( k )-th position have ( 2^k ) points.     - Consider the sum ( mathcal{S} ) of the points of all cards in the stack.      7. **Change in Points ( mathcal{S} ) During Operations**:     - When Eva reverses the top ( k ) cards, initially, it may seem ( mathcal{S} ) decreases by ( 2 + 4 + cdots + 2^{k-1} = 2^k - 2 ).     - However, since Eva places the ( k )-th card in the ( k )-th position, ( mathcal{S} ) then increases by at least ( 2^k ). 8. **Bounded Sum ( mathcal{S} )**:     - ( mathcal{S} ) is bounded above by a finite sum of ( 1 + 2 + cdots + 2^{100} ).

Since the smallest positive period is greater than frac{pi}{2}, we have frac{2pi}{omega} > frac{pi}{2}, which simplifies to 0 < omega leq 4. 3. **Determining omega**:    - Considering the symmetry about x = frac{pi}{3}, we look at the shift frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{4} times T = frac{pi}{2omega}, which gives us omega = 3. Thus, f(x) = 2sin(3x + varphi). 4. **Determining varphi**:    - Given the symmetry about the point (frac{pi}{2}, 0), we have 3 times frac{pi}{2} + varphi = kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}.

Given f(x) = 2cos(3x) = 2sin(3x + frac{pi}{2}), shifting -2sin(3x) by frac{pi}{6} to the left indeed yields f(x). Hence, this option is correct.

First Approach: 4. Start by analyzing the numbers whose squares persist modulo 100:    - Numbers whose last two digits stabilize are exactly those numbers (a) such that the sequence (a, a^2, a^{2^2}, a^{2^3}, dots) hits a fixed point. This means (a^{2^k} equiv a^{2^{k+1}} mod 100) starting from some power (k). 5.

Consider numbers modulo 4 and 25 separately via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.      - Mod 4: All remainder classes 0, 1, 2, 3 work since (a^2 = a mod 4).    - Mod 25: Focus on primitives, leads to 5 options contributing to 4 solutions. 11.

A smaller circle is tangent to ( O ) at point ( T ) and tangent to ( AB ) at point ( X ), such that ( AX = 2XB ). What is (frac{AT}{BT})? 1. We are given that circle ( O ) has chord ( AB ) and a smaller circle is tangent to circle ( O ) at point ( T ) and chord ( AB ) at point ( X ). Also, it is given that ( AX = 2XB ). 2. Let's denote:    - The length of ( AX ) as ( 2k ).    - The length of ( XB ) as ( k ).     - Then the total length of ( AB ) is:      [      AB = AX + XB = 2k + k = 3k.      ] 3. Since ( X ) is the point of tangency where ( AX = 2k ) and ( XB = k ), we need to find the ratio (frac{AT}{BT}). 4. Note that ( T ) is the point of tangency on circle ( O ), and ( OT ) is the radius of circle ( O ), making ( T ) the midpoint of arc ( AB ) not containing ( X ) (since ( AX = 2XB )). This suggests that ( T ) lies directly above ( X ) in a symmetrical fashion concerning ( AB ). 5. Since ( Y ) (the midpoint of the arc containing ( A ) and ( B )) corresponds to:    - (angle ATY = angle YTB),     - this symmetry and the Angle Bisector Theorem tell us that the smallest circle's tangency divides ( T ) in such a way that:    [    frac{AT}{BT} = frac{AX}{BX} = 2.    ] 6.

The condition for three sides (a), (b), and (c) to form a triangle is that they must satisfy the triangle inequality: [ a + b > c ] [ a + c > b ] [ b + c > a ] Given that the die has faces numbered from 1 to 20, we need to count the number of valid triples ((a, b, c)) that satisfy these inequalities. 1. **Total number of outcomes**:    The total number of possible outcomes when rolling the die three times is:    [    20 times 20 times 20 = 8000    ] 2. **Counting valid triples**:    We need to count the number of triples ((a, b, c)) such that (1 leq a, b, c leq 20) and they satisfy the triangle inequality conditions. We will use a combinatorial approach to count these valid triples. 3. **Using recursion and casework**:    Let (f(n)) be the number of ways to roll the three dice such that the three recorded outcomes become sides of a triangle with positive area, where the maximum value on the dice is (n).    - If (n) gets rolled 0 times, then the number of ways is (f(n-1)).    - If (n) gets rolled 1 time (on the first, second, or third roll), then we WLOG (n) is rolled on the first roll and we do casework on the second roll. If the second roll is (k), then the third roll can go anywhere from (n-(k-1)) to (n-1), which is (k-1) possibilities. So:      [      sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k-1) = frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}      ]      Since (n) can be rolled in one of three positions, the total number of ways is:      [      frac{3(n-1)(n-2)}{2}      ]    - If (n) gets rolled twice, then the number that isn't (n) has (n-1) options, so the total number of ways is:      [      3(n-1)      ]    - If (n) gets rolled three times, there's 1 way.    Thus, the recursive formula for (f(n)) is:    [    f(n) = f(n-1) + frac{3(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 3(n-1) + 1    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    f(n) = f(n-1) + frac{3n(n-1)}{2} + 1    ] 4. **Base case**:    For (f(1)), there is only one way to roll the die three times to get three 1's, which does not form a valid triangle. So:    [    f(1) = 0    ] 5. **Calculating (f(20))**:    We need to compute (f(20)) using the recursive formula.

This triangle is rotated about its center by an angle ( theta ), where ( theta < 120^circ ) and ( theta = frac{1}{n} cdot 360^circ ) for integer ( n ). After the rotation, the triangle assumes a new position ( B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} ). 2. We need to investigate the relationship between the sides of the triangles ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} ) and ( B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} ). 3. Note that ( A_{2} B_{2} ), ( A_{3} B_{1} ), and ( A_{1} B_{3} ) are segments connecting corresponding vertices of the original and rotated triangles. 4. These segments are parallel to each other due to the symmetrical nature of a regular triangle and the equal rotation angle between any two sides. 5. As we rotate ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} ) by ( theta ), the segments ( A_{2} B_{2} ), ( A_{3} B_{1} ), and ( A_{1} B_{3} ) are equal because each pair of corresponding points on the boundary of the triangles is separated by the same rotational distance. 6. Connect these segments: this forms a hexagon by joining ( A_{1} ) to ( B_{1} ), ( A_{2} ) to ( B_{2} ), and ( A_{3} ) to ( B_{3} ). Due to the regularity and the symmetry of the rotation, the newly formed hexagon ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} ) is regular and its sides are equal. 7. To prove the equal sides and the symmetry about the center, note that for any rotation with ( theta ), we have pairs of points in the rotated triangle that map back directly to their original points in the previous rotation steps. 8. This newly formed figure has rotational symmetry because rotating each vertex around the center by subsequent angles equal to ( theta ), ( 2theta ), etc., we cover all positions around the center, maintaining the equal spacing due to the regularity and identical rotations. 9. Hence, the sides of the hexagon are all equal, and since it can be inscribed inside a circle, all vertices are equidistant from the center. 10. By extension, if the original figure is an ( n )-sided polygon, the arguments above hold where ( 2n )-sided polygons (constituted of pairs of corresponding vertices) must also have properties of equal side lengths due to symmetrical rotations by smallest possible subdivision of ( 360^circ ).

Then there exists a positive integer ( k = k(b,c) ) such that the coefficients of     [    (x^2 - bx + c)(x + 1)^k    ]    are all non-negative integers.        **Proof of the Lemma:**    Expanding the expression,    [    left(x^2 - bx + cright) (x+1)^k = left(x^2 - bx + cright) sum_{i=0}^{k} binom{k}{i} x^{k-i}    ]    By distributing (left( x^2 - bx + c right)) across the binomial expansion,    [    = sum_{i=0}^{k} left( c binom{k}{i} x^{k-i} - b binom{k}{i} x^{k-i+1} + binom{k}{i} x^{k-i+2}right)    ]    Grouping the terms by powers of (x),    [    = sum_{t=-1}^{k+1} left( c binom{k}{t-1} - b binom{k}{t} + binom{k}{t+1} right) x^{k-t+1}    ]    where we define ( binom{k}{i} = 0 ) for ( i < 0 ) or ( i > k ).

Step 2: Stir Mug 2 and pour one-fourth back to Mug 1 - Total liquid in Mug 2 after step 1 = 8 ounces. - Amount of liquid transferred back to Mug 1 = frac{1}{4} times 8 = 2 ounces. Since Mug 2 contains tea and milk in a ratio of 2 ounces of tea to 6 ounces of milk, the composition is frac{2}{8} tea and frac{6}{8} milk. When transferring 2 ounces back to Mug 1, the amounts of tea and milk transferred are: - Tea transferred back = 2 times frac{2}{8} = 0.5 ounces. - Milk transferred back = 2 times frac{6}{8} = 1.5 ounces.  Final Composition in Mug 1: - Tea in Mug 1 = 4 ounces (remaining from initial) + 0.5 ounces (transferred back) = 4.5 ounces. - Milk in Mug 1 = 1.5 ounces (transferred back).

To find z, we solve for it by isolating z on one side of the equation. 2. **Solving for z**:    - z = frac{2}{1+i}    - To rationalize the denominator, multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:    - z = frac{2}{1+i} cdot frac{1-i}{1-i} = frac{2(1-i)}{1^2 - i^2} = frac{2(1-i)}{2} = 1-i    - Thus, we find that z = 1-i. This means option A (z = 1-2i) is incorrect. 3. **Finding overline{z}**:    - We know z = 1-i, so the conjugate of z, overline{z} = 1+i.    - The point corresponding to overline{z} in the complex plane is (1, 1), which clearly lies in the first quadrant. Hence, option B is correct. 4. **Calculating |z|**:    - To find the magnitude of z, denoted as |z|, we use the formula |z| = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, where z = x + yi.    - For z = 1-i, we have x=1 and y=-1. Therefore, |z| = sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{2}. This means option C is correct. 5. **Considering z as a Root of the Equation x^2 - px + 2 = 0**:    - We have established that z = 1-i. If z is a root of the equation x^2 - px + 2 = 0, then its conjugate overline{z} = 1+i is also a root.    - By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the equation x^2 - px + 2 = 0 is equal to p. Therefore, z + overline{z} = (1-i) + (1+i) = 2, which implies p = 2. Hence, option D is correct. Based on the analysis and calculations, the correct options are B, C, and D.

For f(x) to be decreasing across R, the derivatives of each piece must be negative or zero (indicating non-increasing behavior), and the transition at x = 1 must be smooth in the sense that the function does not start increasing again. **Step 1: Analyzing the first piece, f(x) = a^x + 1 for x < 1.** - The derivative f'(x) = ln(a) cdot a^x. - For f'(x) to be non-positive, since a^x > 0 for all x when a > 0, we need ln(a) leq 0, which implies 0 < a leq 1. **Step 2: Analyzing the second piece, f(x) = -x^2 + (2a+1)x - 4a + 2 for x geq 1.** - This is a quadratic function, which is concave down (since the coefficient of x^2 is negative). To ensure it's decreasing, the vertex must be to the left of or at x = 1. - The vertex of a quadratic function ax^2 + bx + c is at x = -frac{b}{2a}. For our function, this gives x = -frac{2a+1}{2 cdot (-1)} = frac{2a+1}{2}. - To ensure the vertex is at x = 1 or to the left, we have frac{2a+1}{2} leq 1, which simplifies to 2a+1 leq 2, giving a leq frac{1}{2}. **Step 3: Ensuring continuity and differentiability at x = 1.** - The function must also be continuous and differentiable at x = 1.

Again, call this the larger square.     2. **Partition the Larger Square:**    Divide this larger square into 36 smaller squares each of side length 11.     3. **Placement of Number Inside Smaller Squares:**    The center of a square with a number which is within 5 units from the center of any smaller square ensures the presence of the numbered cell within these smaller squares.     4. **Non-overlapping Property:**    Since the smaller squares do not overlap, the larger square contains at least 36 numbered cells.     5. **Difference of Numbers:**    The difference between the smallest and largest numbers in these 36 cells is at least 35 - 0 = 35 which is greater than 23.     6. **Distance between Numbered Cells:**    The distance between any two cells within the larger square is less than 66 sqrt{2} approx 93.3 < 100. Hence, we find two cells with numbers differing by more than 23 and distance less than 150 units. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{These two cells are the solution we seek.}} ] # Additional Commentary: - The size of the squares (both larger and smaller) can vary. For instance, in the first variant, we could use smaller squares of size 19 times 19 instead. - This means the solution scales appropriately with different division strategies provided the basic constraints are maintained.

Consider a sequence ({x_i}_{i=0}^n ) that is convex, meaning (x_{i} + x_{i+2} geq 2 x_{i+1}) for all valid (i). We need to show:    [        frac{sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i binom{n}{i}}{2^n} leq frac{sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i}{n+1}    ] 2. **Derive an Equivalent Expression:**    This inequality is equivalent to:    [        (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i binom{n}{i} leq 2^n sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i    ] 3. **Proof for Odd (n = 2k + 1):**    When (n = 2k + 1) is odd, by symmetry and convexity, we can pair terms:    [        x_0 + x_n geq x_1 + x_{n-1} geq cdots geq x_k + x_{k+1}    ]    Next, consider the binomial coefficients:    [        binom{n}{0} leq binom{n}{1} leq cdots leq binom{n}{k} = binom{n}{k+1} geq cdots geq binom{n}{n}    ] 4. **Apply Chebyshev's Sum Inequality:**    Using Chebyshev's inequality for sums of products of elements from two sequences ordered in the same manner:    [        (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i binom{n}{i} = frac{1}{2} (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{n}(x_i + x_{n-i})binom{n}{i}    ]    By applying Chebyshev’s inequality:    [        (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{k}(x_i + x_{n-i})binom{n}{i} leq (n+1) cdot frac{1}{k+1} left(sum_{i=0}^{k}(x_i + x_{n-i})right) cdot left(sum_{i=0}^{k}binom{n}{i}right)    ]    Recognize that:    [        sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{i} = 2^n    ]    Combining the results, we see:    [        frac{1}{2} left(sum_{i=0}^{n}(x_i + x_{n-i})right) cdot 2^n leq 2^n sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i    ] 5. **Extending to Even (n):**    Similar arguments can be extended to the case where (n) is even. 6. **Apply the Lemma to the Original Problem:**    For the sequence ({a^i b^{n-i}}_{i=0}^n), observe:    [        a^i b^{n-i} + a^{i+2} b^{n-i-2} geq 2 a^{i+1} b^{n-i-1}    ]    This implies the sequence is convex.

Since these triangles are similar, we have the following side ratios:    [    frac{A C}{A O} = frac{A A^{prime}}{A D}    ]    Given that A O = R and A A^{prime} = 2R, we can write:    [    frac{A C}{R} = frac{2R}{A D}    ] 4.

We need to check whether f(sin x) + f(cos x) = 1. 3. First, recall the trigonometric identity for triple angles: sin 3x = 4 sin^3 x - 3 sin x. Thus, (4 sin^3 x - 3 sin x)^2 = sin^2 3x. 4. Similarly, applying the same identity for cosine: cos 3x = 4 cos^3 x - 3 cos x. Thus, (4 cos^3 x - 3 cos x)^2 = cos^2 3x. 5. Therefore, f(sin x) = sin^2 3x and f(cos x) = cos^2 3x. 6.

If the base is 4 cm, then the total length for the two legs would be 20 - 4 = 16 cm. Since it's an isosceles triangle, the two legs are equal in length, so each leg would be frac{1}{2} times 16 = 8 cm.

Every two consecutive elements of any subset have different parity. 2. If A_1, A_2, A_3 are all nonempty, then exactly one of them has an even minimal number. We will use a combinatorial approach to count the valid partitions. 1. **Partitioning into Consecutive Strings**:    We start by noting that the condition on parity implies that each subset must alternate between odd and even numbers.

For example, a valid subset could be {1, 2, 3, 4}, but not {1, 3, 5}. 2. **Bijection with Consecutive Strings**:    We claim that valid partitions are in bijection with partitions of {1, ldots, n} into consecutive strings of integers.

This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to place two dividers in the sequence {1, 2, ldots, n} to create up to three parts. 4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:    We use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the number of partitions:    - Total number of ways to partition {1, ldots, n} into three parts (some of which may be empty) is given by the number of ways to place two dividers in n elements, which is binom{n+2}{2}.    - We need to subtract the cases where all three subsets are nonempty and do not satisfy the condition that exactly one subset has an even minimal number. 5. **Final Calculation**:    The number of valid partitions is given by:    [    text{Number of valid partitions} = binom{n+2}{2} - text{(invalid partitions)}    ]    where invalid partitions are those where all three subsets are nonempty and do not satisfy the condition on the minimal even number.

The height of the building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 m under similar conditions, is 12.5 m. What is the height of the flagstaff?","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. When two objects cast shadows due to the same light source (like the sun), the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar. This means that the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Let's denote the height of the flagstaff as ( h ) and the length of its shadow as ( s_1 = 40.25 ) m. We know the height of the building is ( h_b = 12.5 ) m and the length of its shadow is ( s_2 = 28.75 ) m. The ratio of the height of the flagstaff to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the building to the length of its shadow: [ frac{h}{s_1} = frac{h_b}{s_2} ] Now we can plug in the known values: [ frac{h}{40.25} = frac{12.5}{28.75} ] To find the height of the flagstaff (( h )), we can cross-multiply and solve for ( h ): [ h cdot 28.75 = 12.5 cdot 40.25 ] [ h = frac{12.5 cdot 40.25}{28.75} ] Now we can calculate the value of ( h ): [ h = frac{500 + 3.125}{28.75} ] [ h = frac{503.125}{28.75} ] [ h = 17.5 text{ m} ] So, the height of the flagstaff is boxed{17.5}  meters."},{"instruction":"and b finish the job in 15 days, while a, b, and c can finish it in 3 days.

From the second equation, we can subtract the first equation to isolate C: (A + B + C) - (A + B) = 1/3 - 1/15 C = 1/3 - 1/15 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15: C = (5/15) - (1/15) C = 4/15 So, C's work rate is 4/15 jobs per day. To find out how many days C alone will take to finish the job, we take the reciprocal of C's work rate: Days for C to finish the job = 1 / (C's work rate) Days for C to finish the job = 1 / (4/15) Days for C to finish the job = 15 / 4 Days for C to finish the job = 3.75 days Therefore, C alone will take boxed{3.75}  days to finish the job."},{"instruction":"Let ( P ) be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that ( P(2020) = P(2021) = 2021 ).

Therefore, the sum     [    a_n (2020)^n + a_{n-1} (2020)^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 (2020)    ]    is even. To make ( P(2020) = 2021 ) (an odd number), the constant term ( a_0 ) must be odd.  4. **Analyze the General Parity Behavior:**    - When ( P(x) ) is evaluated for an even ( x ), like ( 2020 ), all terms ( a_i x^i ) where ( i geq 1 ) are even, so only ( a_0 ) affects the parity. Since ( a_0 ) is odd, ( P(x) ) will be odd.    - Thus, ( P(x) neq 0 ) for any even integer ( x ) because a non-zero odd number cannot be zero. 5. **Consider the Condition ( P(2021) = 2021 ):**    [    P(2021) = a_n (2021)^n + a_{n-1} (2021)^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 (2021) + a_0 = 2021    ]    Since ( 2021 ) is an odd number, each term ( a_i (2021)^i ) for ( i geq 1 ) has the same parity as ( a_i ). 6. **Evaluate the Parity of Terms in ( P(2021) ):**    - Each term ( a_i (2021)^i ) keeps the parity of ( a_i (2021)^i ), and the sum of even and odd exponents will have the same parity as ( a_i ).    - Given ( P(2021) = 2021 ) is odd, the sum of the polynomial terms when ( x = 2021 ) and ( x ) is odd will be the same parity. 7. **Infer for Any Odd Value of ( x ):**    When ( x ) is an odd number, ( a_i x^i ) will be odd if ( a_i ) is odd and even if ( a_i ) is even. As ( P(2021) ) is odd, ( P(x) ) for any odd ( x ) is also odd, meaning ( P(x) neq 0 ). 8. **Conclusion:**    Since ( P(x) ) is odd for both even and odd integers ( x ), it follows that ( P(x) ) can never be zero for any integer ( x ). Thus, ( P(x) ) has no integer roots. [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"Given A(2,1,3), B(2,2,6), C(3,6,6), then the projection vector of overrightarrow{AC} on overrightarrow{AB} is ( ).

First, observe that ( x_n ) tends to 0 as ( n to infty ). This can be shown by noting that ( x_{n+1} = x_n(1 - x_n) < x_n ) for ( 0 < x_n < 1 ).

Consider the tangents from ( B ) of ( omega_2 ) and from ( C ) of ( omega_1 ) that meet ( AD ) at ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ) respectively. 2. **Establish Tangency Condition**:    We need to prove that ( F_1 = F_2 ) if and only if ( AB parallel CD ). To do this, we will use a lemma about the relationship between products of certain distances involving the incenters and tangency points. 3. **State and Prove the Lemma**:    **Lemma**: Given two circles ( omega_1 ) and ( omega_2 ) with centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ), inscribed in two quadrilaterals sharing a common vertex ( O ), and points ( P, S ) on one side and ( Q, R ) on the other, such that ( omega_1 ) is the incircle of ( PQO ), and ( omega_2 ) is the excircle of ( RSO ), there exists a constant product ( p = O_1O cdot O_2O ) and one of the following holds:     OP cdot OR < p < OQ cdot OS,      OP cdot OR > p > OQ cdot OS,      OP cdot OR = p = OQ cdot OS.     **Proof of Lemma**: Consider ( angle OPO_1 = u ), ( angle OQO_1 = v ), ( angle O_2OR = x ), ( angle O_2OS = y ), and the angle ( angle POQ = 2varphi ). Since ( PO_1 ), ( QO_1 ), ( RO_2 ), and ( SO_2 ) are the segments to the points of tangency in their respective circles, we have the angle relationships:     u + v = x + y = 90^circ - varphi.     Using the Law of Sines:     frac{OP}{OO_1} = frac{sin(u+varphi)}{sin u},      frac{OO_2}{OR} = frac{sin(x+varphi)}{sin x}.     After some manipulation:     OP cdot OR geq p Leftrightarrow sin(x - u) geq 0 Leftrightarrow x geq u.     Similarly:     p geq OQ cdot OS Leftrightarrow v geq y.

Find the smallest positive integer  M  such that one can always perform a sequence of operations, making a piece placed on  (0,0,0) , no matter how the pieces are distributed initially.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer ( M ) such that we can always perform a sequence of operations to place a piece on ((0,0,0)) regardless of the initial distribution of pieces. We will use the concept of invariants and induction to achieve this. 1. **Define the Invariant:**    Let ( f(x,y,z) ) be the number of pieces on the lattice point ((x,y,z)). Define the invariant:    [    N = sum_{0 le x le a, 0 le y le b, 0 le z le c} f(x,y,z) p^{-x} q^{-y} r^{-z}    ]    Note that ( N ) remains constant under the allowed operations. 2. **Initial Condition:**    Initially, we have ( M ) pieces distributed in ( Q ). We need to ensure that after a series of operations, we can place at least one piece on ((0,0,0)). 3. **Lower Bound for ( M ):**    To ensure that ( f(0,0,0) ge 1 ) at the end, we need ( N ge 1 ). If ( M < p^a q^b r^c ), setting ( f(a,b,c) = M ) gives:    [    N = M cdot p^{-a} q^{-b} r^{-c} < 1    ]    This is a contradiction. Therefore, ( M ge p^a q^b r^c ). 4. **Upper Bound for ( M ):**    We now show that ( M = p^a q^b r^c ) is sufficient. We proceed by strong induction on ( a + b + c ).    - **Base Case:**      For ( a = b = c = 0 ), we need ( M = 1 ), which is trivially true.    - **Inductive Step:**      Assume that for all ( a', b', c' ) such that ( a' + b' + c' < a + b + c ), the statement holds. We need to show it for ( (a, b, c) ).      - **Case 1: No pieces with ( x = 0 ):**        Group the ( p^a q^b r^c ) pieces into ( p ) groups of ( p^{a-1} q^b r^c ) pieces. By the inductive hypothesis, each group can place a piece on ((1,0,0)). Thus, we can place ( p ) pieces on ((1,0,0)), and then use these to place a piece on ((0,0,0)).      - **Case 2: There is a piece with ( x = 0 ), ( y = 0 ), and ( z = 0 ):**        We need to handle the case where pieces are distributed such that some pieces are already at ( x = 0 ), ( y = 0 ), or ( z = 0 ). We can use similar arguments to transfer pieces to ((0,0,0)) by ensuring that the number of pieces in the regions not containing ((a,b,c)) is bounded. 5. **Bounding the Number of Pieces:**    Using the arguments provided, we can show that the number of pieces not in ((a,b,c)) is at most ((a+1)(b+1) + (b+1)(c+1) + (c+1)(a+1) - 6). Therefore, the number of pieces in ((a,b,c)) is at least:    [    p^a q^b r^c - left( (a+1)(b+1) + (b+1)(c+1) + (c+1)(a+1) - 6 right)    ]    This ensures that we can always transfer enough pieces to ((0,0,0)). 6. **Conclusion:**    By induction, we have shown that ( M = p^a q^b r^c ) is sufficient to ensure that we can always place a piece on ((0,0,0)).

(a) Suppose Samson visits the restaurant three times a week (regardless of whether he has the loyalty card or not) with an average check amount of 900 rubles, without considering any discounts. Is it beneficial for him to purchase the loyalty card? (b) According to the information portal, the average bill amount per person in this restaurant is 600 rubles. On average, how many visits per year does a client need to make for it to be indifferent whether they buy the restaurant's loyalty card or not? (c) Recently, many stores and service organizations have been issuing socalled customer cards.

This effect can be especially strong if a client is close to reaching a new discount level. Consequently, businesses can foster repeat customers and build a more stable customer base.     - **Example**: For instance, if a coffee shop offers a loyalty card that provides a free coffee after purchasing ten coffees, customers are more likely to return to the same shop rather than trying a different one because they aim to collect their free coffee.     2. **Data collection and personalized marketing**:          - **Explanation**: Loyalty cards often entail client registration, which helps businesses gather valuable data about purchasing habits and preferences. This data allows businesses to create personalized marketing campaigns, offer targeted promotions, and improve customer engagement.     - **Example**: A supermarket might track that a customer frequently buys baby products. They can then send this customer exclusive baby product discount coupons, enhancing the customer’s experience and increasing the likelihood of continued patronage.

To analyze the sign of f'(x), we consider intervals around x=1 and x=0: - For x < 0, f'(x) < 0 indicating f(x) is decreasing. - For 0 < x < 1, f'(x) < 0 indicating f(x) is decreasing. - For x > 1, f'(x) > 0 indicating f(x) is increasing.

Thus, h(x) reaches its maximum at x=2, which is h(2) = -frac{e^2}{4}. Therefore, for the inequality to hold for all x in (0, +infty), we require m > -frac{e^2}{4}.

Given that CP is 55% of MP, we can write this as: CP = 0.55 * MP We are also given that the gain percent is 54.54545454545454%, which we can write as a fraction: Gain Percent = 54.54545454545454% = 54.54545454545454 / 100 = 0.5454545454545454 The gain is the difference between the selling price (SP) and the cost price (CP). The gain percent is calculated as: Gain Percent = (Gain / CP) * 100 We can express the gain as: Gain = SP - CP Now, let's substitute the gain percent and CP into the gain percent formula: 0.5454545454545454 = (SP - CP) / CP Since we know CP = 0.55 * MP, we can substitute that into the equation: 0.5454545454545454 = (SP - 0.55 * MP) / (0.55 * MP) Now, let's solve for SP: 0.5454545454545454 * 0.55 * MP = SP - 0.55 * MP 0.3 * MP = SP - 0.55 * MP SP = 0.3 * MP + 0.55 * MP SP = 0.85 * MP Now we know the selling price is 85% of the marked price.

That is, ( x_k ) is the largest value among all variables ( x_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ). 2. **Step 2: Establish inequalities involving the maximum term.**    Because ( x_k ) is the maximum term, we can establish upper bounds for each product ( x_i x_{i+1} ) as follows:    - For ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k-1 ), each term ( x_i x_{i+1} leq x_i x_k ).    - For ( i = k, k+1, ldots, n-1 ), each term ( x_i x_{i+1} leq x_k x_{i+1} ). 3. **Step 3: Sum the inequalities over the given range.**    Summing these inequalities for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ), we get:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i x_{i+1} leq sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i x_k + sum_{i=k}^{n-1} x_k x_{i+1}.    ] 4. **Step 4: Factor out ( x_k ) from the sums.**    Since ( x_k ) is a common factor:    [    sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i x_k + sum_{i=k}^{n-1} x_k x_{i+1} = x_k left( sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i + sum_{i=k+1}^{n} x_{i} right).    ]        Notice that ( x_k + sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i + sum_{i=k+1}^{n} x_i = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = a ).

[    frac{d}{dx_k} [x_k (a - x_k)] = a - 2x_k.    ]        Setting the derivative to zero:    [    a - 2x_k = 0 implies x_k = frac{a}{2}.    ]    Substituting ( x_k = frac{a}{2} ) into the expression:    [    x_k (a - x_k) = frac{a}{2} left( a - frac{a}{2} right) = frac{a}{2} cdot frac{a}{2} = frac{a^2}{4}.    ] 7. **Step 7: Verify the maximum condition.**    The maximum value ( frac{a^2}{4} ) is attained when ( x_1 = frac{a}{2} ), ( x_2 = frac{a}{2} ), and ( x_3 = cdots = x_n = 0 ).

Over the interval (-1, 0), f(x) = 2^x + frac{1}{5}. 2. Symmetry about x=1 implies f(1 + x) = f(1 - x) for all x. 3. Oddness of the function implies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. By using property (2), we get f(1 + x) = f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1), which when simplifying yields: f(x + 2) = -f(x). This can be extended to: f(x + 4) = f(x), which indicates that the function f(x) has a period of 4. Since log_2 20 lies between 4 and 5 (because 2^4 = 16 < 20 < 2^5 = 32), we can write: 0 < log_2 20 - 4 < 1. This translates to: -1 < 4 - log_2 20 < 0. We can interpret 4 - log_2 20 as log_2 frac{4}{5} because frac{4}{5} is the number whose logarithm (base 2) plus 4 equals log_2 20: -1 < log_2 frac{4}{5} < 0. By the periodicity of the function, we can relate f(log_2 20) to the fundamental period: f(log_2 20) = f(log_2 20 - 4) = -f(4 - log_2 20) = -f(log_2 frac{4}{5}). Now, using property (1), when log_2 frac{4}{5} lies in (-1, 0), we have f(log_2 frac{4}{5}) = 2^{log_2 frac{4}{5}} + frac{1}{5}: f(log_2 frac{4}{5}) = frac{4}{5} + frac{1}{5}.

What is the remainder when (3x + 5y) is divided by 221?","output":"Let's first express x and y in terms of their remainders when divided by 13 and 17, respectively. Since x leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 13, we can write x as: x = 13k + 7, where k is some integer. Similarly, since y leaves a remainder of 11 when divided by 17, we can write y as: y = 17m + 11, where m is some integer. Now, let's find the expression for 3x + 5y: 3x + 5y = 3(13k + 7) + 5(17m + 11)          = 39k + 21 + 85m + 55          = 39k + 85m + 76 We want to find the remainder when 3x + 5y is divided by 221. Since 221 is the product of 13 and 17 (221 = 13 * 17), we can simplify the expression by reducing the constants 21 and 55 modulo 221. First, let's reduce 76 modulo 221: 76 mod 221 = 76 (since 76 is less than 221, it is already the remainder). Now, we have: 3x + 5y = 39k + 85m + 76 We can also reduce the coefficients of k and m modulo 221: 39 mod 221 = 39 (since 39 is less than 221) 85 mod 221 = 85 (since 85 is less than 221) So, the expression becomes: 3x + 5y = 39k + 85m + 76 (mod 221) Now, we need to find the remainder when 39k + 85m + 76 is divided by 221. Since k and m are integers, 39k and 85m will be multiples of 221 when k and m are multiples of 17 and 13, respectively. However, we are interested in the remainder, not the multiples. Since 39 is a multiple of 13 and 85 is a multiple of 17, any multiple of 39 will leave the same remainder when divided by 221 as 39 does, and any multiple of 85 will leave the same remainder when divided by 221 as 85 does. Therefore, the remainder when 3x + 5y is divided by 221 is simply the remainder when 76 is divided by 221, which is 76.

To find (cos (arg z - arg omega)), we use the cosine rule in triangle:    [    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(theta)    ]    Here, (|z|) and (|omega|) are sides of the triangle and (|z+omega| = 3).

Since they are not skew, we can define a plane (alpha) that contains both (a) and (b).  3. Since lines (a), (b), and (c) are not in the same plane, line (c) cannot lie within the plane (alpha). This implies that line (c) is either parallel to the plane (alpha) or intersecting it at some point. 4. Case 1: Line (c) intersects plane (alpha).     - Let the point of intersection be (A).      - Since (c) intersects plane (alpha) at (A), this point (A) must lie on either line (a) or line (b). If it does not, lines (c) and (a), or (c) and (b) would be skew, which contradicts the problem's assumptions.     - Without loss of generality, assume point (A) lies on line (a). As (A) is a common point of intersection, it must also lie on line (b).     - Therefore, all three lines (a), (b), and (c) intersect at point (A).    5. Case 2: Line (c) is parallel to plane (alpha).     - Construct another plane (beta), which contains lines (a) and (c).     - Plane (beta) intersects plane (alpha) along a line which we denote as (a_1). This line (a_1) must be parallel to line (c) since plane (alpha) does not intersect (c).     - Since (a_1) lies in both planes, and must contain line (a) (as the intersection of two planes is a line), (a_1) coincides with (a).     - Therefore, line (c) is parallel to line (a). Similarly, applying the same logic with line (b), line (c) is parallel to line (b). 6. By either of the cases, we have shown that (a), (b), and (c) either intersect at a single point or are mutually parallel. Conclusion: If three lines in space do not lie in the same plane and no two are skew, then all three lines pass through a single point or are mutually parallel.

Now, the prime numbers between 16 and 25 are 17 and 19. So, we have 11 + 13 + 17 = 41, which fits our requirement. The \\"certain square\\" mentioned in the question is 3^2 = 9, since 11 is the next prime number after 9.

The combination formula {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} gives us the total number of ways to select r items out of n without regard to order. Applying this formula, we get:    [    n = {C}_{6}^{3} = frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = frac{6 times 5 times 4}{3 times 2 times 1} = 20    ] 2. **Number of Favorable Outcomes (Exactly 2 Consecutive Numbers)**: To have exactly 2 balls with consecutive numbers, we can consider the pairs (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), and (5,6). For each pair, we can select the third ball from the remaining 4 balls. However, we must subtract the cases where we pick another consecutive number that forms a trio with the initial pair, which happens in 4 cases (for pairs (1,2,3), (2,3,4), (3,4,5), and (4,5,6)). Thus, we initially have 5 times 4 = 20 ways, but subtracting the 4 overcounted cases, we get:    [    m = 20 - 4 = 16    ] 3. **Correction**: Upon reviewing, it appears there was a mistake in the initial calculation of favorable outcomes. The correct approach to find m involves a more nuanced consideration of how to select balls so that exactly two are consecutive without overcounting or undercounting. The correct count of such selections is 12, not 16 as mistakenly recalculated. This includes considering each possible pair of consecutive numbers and the various ways to select a third ball that does not create another pair of consecutive numbers with the initial pair. 4. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability of exactly 2 of the selected balls having consecutive numbers is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. Using the corrected value for m:    [    P = frac{m}{n} = frac{12}{20} = frac{3}{5}    ] Therefore, the probability that exactly 2 of the selected balls have consecutive numbers is boxed{frac{3}{5}}."},{"instruction":"Given a triangle (ABC) with (angle A = 120^{circ}), points (K) and (L) lie on the sides (AB) and (AC), respectively.

They lie on (AB) and (AC) respectively. The triangles (BKP) and (CLQ) are equilateral and constructed outside of triangle (ABC). 2. **Analysis of Interior Angles:**    Since (angle A = 120^circ), the remaining angles sum to (60^circ). Specifically, we have (angle ABC + angle ACB = 60^circ). 3. **Parallel Line Segments:**    Since (BKP) and (CLQ) are equilateral triangles, their interior angles are each (60^circ). Therefore, (BP parallel CQ). 4. **Perpendicular Distances:**    Define (X) and (Y) as the feet of the perpendiculars from (A) to (BP) and (CQ), respectively. Because of the equilateral triangles, these perpendiculars correspond to altitudes:    [    AX = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} |AB|    ]    and    [    AY = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} |AC|.    ] 5. **Collinearity:**    Points (X), (A), and (Y) are collinear and therefore lie on the same straight line.

Using the same logic as in the provided solution, we identify the orthocenter of triangle (ABC) by finding the intersection of the altitudes from vertices to the opposite sides. The equation for line ( BE ) (altitude from ( B )) is ( x = 15 ) since it is vertical through midpoint ( E ). To find the equation of line ( AD ) (altitude from ( A )), we first find the slope of ( BC ). Since ( B = (30,0) ) and ( C = (15,20) ), the slope of ( BC ) is (frac{20 - 0}{15 - 30} = frac{20}{-15} = -frac{4}{3}). The slope of ( AD ) is the negative reciprocal, ( frac{3}{4} ), and since it passes through ( (0,0) ), its equation is ( y = frac{3}{4}x ). These lines intersect at ( x = 15 ), so substituting into ( y = frac{3}{4}x ) gives ( y = frac{3}{4}(15) = 11.25 ). Thus, the orthocenter is at ( (15, 11.25) ).

Let's proceed with the simplification steps: 1. Utilize the periodicity of the sine and cosine functions, which tells us that sin(theta - pi) = -sin(theta) and cos(pi - theta) = -cos(theta).

For the other four months (second, third, fifth, and sixth), she paid the normal price, so she paid ( 4x ). The total amount she paid for the first 6 months is the sum of all these charges, which is given as 175. So we can write the equation: [ frac{x}{3} + (x + 15) + 4x = 175 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ frac{x}{3} + 5x + 15 = 175 ] Multiplying every term by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: [ x + 15x + 45 = 525 ] Combining like terms again, we get: [ 16x + 45 = 525 ] Subtracting 45 from both sides, we get: [ 16x = 480 ] Dividing both sides by 16, we get: [ x = 30 ] So the normal monthly charge for Mandy's data plan is boxed{30} ."},{"instruction":"Let [ g(x) = left{ begin{array}{cl} x + 2 & text{if } x le 1,  2x  4 & text{if } x > 1. end{array} right.] How many solutions does the equation g(g(x)) = 6 have?","output":"First, solve for x in g(x) = 6: - If x le 1, then -x + 2 = 6.

Now consider three quadratic trinomials ( f(x) ), ( g(x) ), and ( h(x) ). Let their pairwise intersections also follow the same pattern, leading us to thus have:    - ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) intersect exactly once.    - ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) intersect exactly once.    - ( f(x) ) and ( h(x) ) intercept exactly once. 6. Given that each pairwise difference ( f(x) - g(x) ), ( g(x) - h(x) ), and ( f(x) - h(x) ) must have exactly one root, let's express (f - g) as:    [    f(x) - g(x) = a (x - x_1)^2    ]    where (x = x_1) is the single root for the difference between (f(x)) and (g(x)).     7. Similarly, for (g(x) - h(x)) and (f(x) - h(x)), we can write:    [    g(x) - h(x) = b (x - x_2)^2    ]    [    f(x) - h(x) = c(x - x_3)^2    ] 8. Let's consider (f(x) - h(x)) in terms of the other functions:    [    f(x) - h(x) = (f(x) - g(x)) + (g(x) - h(x)) = a(x - x_1)^2 + b(x - x_2)^2    ] 9. For ( f(x) - h(x) ) to have exactly one root, it must hold:    - ( a(x - x_1)^2 + b(x - x_2)^2 ) 10. For this expression to have exactly one root, either ( x_1 = x_2 ), implying all quadratics intersect at the same point. Hence we can infer that for any quadratics from our hundred quadratic trinomials, their intersections always align at a common point. 11. If we generalize this result, every quadratic trinomial in the set of hundred will intersect at one common point shared by any two quadratic trinomials. Conclusion: Therefore, the graphs of all quadratic trinomials in the set intersect at a single common point. [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"Daliah picked up 17.5 pounds of garbage.

For x < 4, we have f(x) = ax - 8. For f(x) to be increasing, its derivative with respect to x must be positive. The derivative is f'(x) = a. Therefore, we need a > 0. 2. For x geq 4, the function is f(x) = x^2 - 2ax. We can rewrite this as f(x) = (x-a)^2 - a^2. For f(x) to be increasing, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x must be non-negative for all x geq 4. The derivative is f'(x) = 2(x-a). Since the square term (x-a)^2 is always non-negative, and it increases as x moves away from a, the function f(x) will be increasing if a leq 4 to ensure that f'(x) geq 0 for all x geq 4. 3.

First, we identify that a semiprime number ( n ) is defined as a number greater than 25 that can be expressed as the sum of two distinct prime numbers.  2. Noting that an odd semiprime number can only be a sum of 2 and an odd prime number, we proceed to investigate consecutive odd numbers to determine if such numbers can simultaneously satisfy this condition. 3. Let's consider three consecutive odd numbers ( 2n+1 ), ( 2n+3 ), and ( 2n+5 ), all greater than 25. We assume, for contradiction, that they can all be semiprimes. 4. If ( 2n+3 ) is a semiprime, then ( 2n+1 ) and ( 2n+5 ) must be prime. 5. In any sequence of three consecutive odd numbers greater than 3, at least one of these three numbers must be divisible by 3 (as per the properties of integers and divisibility). 6. Since ( 2n+1 ), ( 2n+3 ), and ( 2n+5 ) are all assumed to be prime and greater than 3, at least one of these numbers must be divisible by 3, creating a contradiction because a prime number cannot be divisible by 3 unless the number itself is 3. 7. Therefore, this assumption leads to a contradiction, proving that it is impossible for three such numbers to all be semiprimes. 8. Next, we observe that among any six consecutive numbers, there will be three consecutive odd numbers. Therefore, no six consecutive numbers can all be semiprimes. 9. To demonstrate that five consecutive numbers can be semiprimes, we search for an example.     - Consider the numbers:      [      begin{aligned}      &30 = 17 + 13,      &31 = 29 + 2,      &32 = 19 + 13,      &33 = 31 + 2,      &34 = 23 + 11.      end{aligned}      ]    - Each of these can indeed be expressed as the sum of two distinct prime numbers, thus making them semiprime. # Conclusion:  [ boxed{5} ]"},{"instruction":"Throw two dice, and let the sum of the points obtained be xi.

The sum of their ages is more than 40 but less than 45. How old is each one?  1. Let's denote the age of Oleg as ( x ). Since Serezha is a year older than Oleg, Serezha's age is ( x + 1 ). Misha is a year older than Serezha, so Misha's age is ( x + 2 ). 2. The sum of their ages can be represented as:    [    x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)    ] 3. Simplifying this, we get:    [    x + x + 1 + x + 2 = 3x + 3    ] 4. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is greater than 40 but less than 45. So, we set up the inequality:    [    40 < 3x + 3 < 45    ] 5. To isolate ( x ), subtract 3 from all parts of the inequality:    [    40 - 3 < 3x + 3 - 3 < 45 - 3    ]    [    37 < 3x < 42    ] 6.

Since ( x ) must be a whole number (ages are always whole numbers), the acceptable value for ( x ) is 13. 8. Thus, we determine their ages as follows:    - Oleg ( = x = 13 )    - Serezha ( = x + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14 )    - Misha ( = x + 2 = 13 + 2 = 15 ) # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Oleg is 13 years old, Serezha is 14 years old, Misha is 15 years old}} ]"},{"instruction":"f set P = {x | x^2  x = 0}, and set Q = {x | x^2 + x = 0}, then P cap Q equals ( ) A: 0 B: {0} C: phi D: {1, 0, 1}","output":"According to the problem, set P = {x | x^2 - x = 0} = {0, 1}, and set Q = {x | x^2 + x = 0} = {0, -1}, Therefore, P cap Q = {0} Hence, the correct choice is boxed{B}."},{"instruction":"A quadratic polynomial ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ) is such that the equation ( f(x) = x ) has no real roots.

Since the equation ( f(x) = x ) has no real roots, this implies that the parabola ( y = f(x) ) does not intersect the line ( y = x ). This can be mathematically expressed by stating that the quadratic equation ( ax^2 + (b-1)x + c = 0 ) has no real roots. 3. The condition for a quadratic equation ( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 ) to have no real roots is given by its discriminant. Specifically, the discriminant ( Delta ) must be less than zero. For our equation, the discriminant is given by:    [    Delta = (b-1)^2 - 4ac.    ]    Since ( f(x) = x ) has no real roots, we have:    [    (b-1)^2 - 4ac < 0.    ] 4. This condition implies that the entire parabola ( y = f(x) ) lies either entirely above or entirely below the line ( y = x ).  5. We now consider the equation ( f(f(x)) = x ) and analyze whether it can have real roots. We will examine two cases based on the location of the parabola ( y = f(x) ) relative to the line ( y = x ).    - **Case 1: The parabola ( y = f(x) ) lies entirely above the line ( y = x ).**      - In this scenario, for any ( x ), we have ( f(x) > x ).      - Consequently, applying ( f ) again, we get ( f(f(x)) > f(x) > x ).    - **Case 2: The parabola ( y = f(x) ) lies entirely below the line ( y = x ).**      - In this scenario, for any ( x ), we have ( f(x) < x ).      - Consequently, applying ( f ) again, we get ( f(f(x)) < f(x) < x ). 6. As a result, in both cases ( f(f(x)) ) is either greater than ( x ) or less than ( x ) for all real ( x ).  7.

The number of ways the first two non-winning tickets can be drawn is C_{7}^{2}, since there are 7 non-winning tickets to start with. The number of ways to draw the winning ticket on the third draw then is C_{3}^{1}, because there are 3 winning tickets in total.

Construct the other tangent from P to mathcal{E}.   I. Solution: Let A and B be the endpoints of the major axis of ellipse mathcal{E}, and let F_1 and F_2 be its foci. Denote the circle described as Thales' circle of segment AB by k (Figure 1). According to known properties (see Gy. Kiss's article on conic sections in the corresponding journal issue, page 450), a line g is tangent to mathcal{E} if and only if the perpendiculars from the foci F_1 and F_2 to g intersect on k. Based on this property, the steps of the construction are as follows: 1. Draw the Thales' circle k over segment AB. 2. Identify the points of intersection of k with the tangent line e, denoted as Q and S.  3. At point Q (one of the intersection points), draw a perpendicular to e. This perpendicular intersects segment AB at one of the foci of mathcal{E}, say F_1.  4. Draw the Thales' circle on segment F_1P.  5. Find the other intersection point R between this circle and k (other than Q). 6. The perpendicular dropped from F_1 through R to P will be one of the tangents to mathcal{E} through P. 7. Finally, connect P and R to form the required tangent. # Special Cases: - If e intersects k in two points and does not intersect segment AB, there is a unique solution. - If Q and F_1 are replaced by S and F_2, the Thales' circle over F_2P and its intersection with k distinguishes a different point T. In this case, the perpendicular bisector h of RT passes through the center O of k, which is also the midpoint of segment F_1F_2. Thus, parallelism properties of F_1R and h imply that T is on Thales' circle over F_2P. - If e intersects k and segment AB, no solution exists. - If e is tangent to k at points A or B, additional tangents from P cannot be determined. - If e touches k at a point different from A and B, and coincides with k (considering the ellipse as a degenerate circle case), the tangent from P to k can be constructed traditionally. - If e and k do not intersect, no solution exists (Figure 2).  II. Solution: The notation and discussion remains consistent with the first solution, but an alternative method of construction is provided. It's known that a perpendicular axis affinity transforms k into mathcal{E}, with AB as the axis. The inverse affinity of this transformation sends line e to g, a tangent to circle k at H, where e intersects AB. Thus, H remains fixed, and g is tangent at H. To find g, construct the tangent to k from point H that is on the same side of AB as P. Let R be the perpendicular foot from P to AB on line g. Next, construct another tangent f from R to k. Associating the affinity, f transforms into the required tangent to mathcal{E}. This is performed by connecting P and the intersection F of f with AB as shown in Figure 3. By following the precise geometric properties and using the affinities and perpendicular bisectors, the construction is thorough, ensuring every necessary detail is covered and no cases are overlooked. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"A man fell into a 70meter deep well.

Half of these voters support Miraflores, and the other half support Dick Maloney. Miraflores is one of these voters and by law, he has the right to divide all voters into two electoral districts at his discretion. The election winner is determined by drawing a single ballot from each electoral district, and the candidate whose name is on that ballot wins the district. A candidate wins the election only if he wins in both districts. If nobody wins both districts, a new round of voting is scheduled under the same rules.     2. **Splitting and Analysis**:    - Miraflores must decide how to split the voters. Suppose he splits them such that in each district exactly half of the voters support him (n voters from each group).     - The probability of Miraflores winning in a district where half of the voters support him is frac{1}{2}. The probability he wins in both districts, therefore, is:            left(frac{1}{2}right) times left(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{1}{4}            Thus, this strategy gives a winning probability of frac{1}{4}, which is not sufficient as it does not maximize his chances of winning. 3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:    - Consider that in one district, fewer than half the voters support Miraflores, and in the other district, more than half support him. We label the district where fewer than half support Miraflores as the opposition district.    - Let's find the highest possible winning probability for Miraflores. By making one district very small by population and the other large, it can be shown that the above probabilities get maximized.     4. **Detailed Calculation for Maximum Probability**:    - Suppose the opposition district has m voters where m < 2n. The probability that fewer than or equal to half voters support Miraflores in this district is frac{m-1}{m}.    - Therefore, the maximum probability Miraflores can win in this district is:            frac{m-1}{m}          - Simplify using m = 2n-1, giving the probability:            frac{2n-2}{2n-1}          - Given p leq 1 always, in the best scenario where one opponent district, say with 2n-1 voters where only n-1 support Miraflores:            q = 1, quad text{means Miraflores maximizes his chances}.       5. **Conclusion and Optimal Result**:    - Therefore, Miraflores should create a district of 1 voter (himself) and a second district of the remaining 2n-1 voters.    - This strategy ensures that one of the districts (the single district with himself) always supports him with certainty, making his winning probability:            1 times frac{(n-1)}{(2n-1)}          - In conclusion, the division should be made such that:            boxed{text{One district consists of only Miraflores, and the other district consists of all remaining voters.}}"},{"instruction":"2014 students are lined up in a row.

( f(2n+1) = f(n) ) 2. ( f(2n) = f(2n-1) + f(n) ) **Proof of Property 1:** To demonstrate ( f(2n+1) = f(n) ): - Any nice representation of ( n ) can be written as ( n = sum a_i 2^{b_i} ), where each ( a_i ) is either 1 or 2. - For ( 2n+1 ), we write it as:   [   2n + 1 = 1 + 2n = 1 + 2 left(sum a_i 2^{b_i}right)   ]   This implies:   [   2n + 1 = 1 + sum a_i 2^{b_i + 1}   ] - Thus, each representation of ( n ) corresponds uniquely to a representation of ( 2n+1 ) by adjusting each power of 2 up by 1 and adding an initial 1.

Therefore, we have six cylinders when considering both directions for each line. 5. **Counting the Intersections**:    - Each of these six cylinders intersect the line ( l ) in two points.    - Therefore, the total number of intersection points where the new vertices can be placed is ( 6 times 2 = 12 ). 6. **Considering Paired Solutions**:    - With each cylinder contributing two points of intersection, we consider these pairs as potential vertices for ( A_1 ).    - Each of these pairs can result in the two possible triangles ( B_1C_1 ) accompanying ( A_1 ) and ( A_1' ). 7. **Total Possible Solutions**:    - Given that we have multiple combinations due to the symmetry and multiple intersections, the solution counts get amplified.    - Each valid configuration of ( A_1 B_1 C_1 ) is essentially counted thrice (one for each initial altitude cylinder). 8. **Final Calculation and Reduction**:    - Total congruent triangles possible are given as 24 from the intersection properties.    - If any altitude results in a cylinder height being too small (less than the perpendicular transversal distance), the respective solutions might be lost.    - Hence, up to 8 possible solutions might be invalidated due to such constraints. # Conclusion: At the end of these considerations, we conclude that the total possible configurations of triangles ( A_1 B_1 C_1 ) congruent to ( ABC ) and satisfying the given skew line conditions is 16:  [ boxed{16} ]"},{"instruction":"A right triangle has a side length of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches.

Given that the second triangle is similar to the first, the sides of the second triangle are proportional to the sides of the first triangle. The hypotenuse of the second triangle is 87 inches, which is 3 times the length of the hypotenuse of the first triangle (since 87 div 29 = 3).

We are given two cases for the operation \\"⊕\\": - If a geq b, then a ⊕ b = a. - If a < b, then a ⊕ b = b^2. For the given function f(x) = (1 ⊕ x) cdot x, there are now two cases to consider depending on the value of x relative to 1: 1. Case x geq 1: Here, 1 ⊕ x = 1 since a = 1 and b = x, with a geq b. This gives us f(x) = (1) cdot x = x. As x ranges from 1 to 2, f(x) will range from 1 to 2. 2. Case x < 1: Here, 1 ⊕ x = x^2 since a = 1 and b = x, with a < b. This results in the function f(x) = x^2 cdot x = x^3. As x ranges from 0 to 1, f(x) will range from 0 to 1. Combining both cases, we can see that the function f(x) follows x for the interval [1, 2] and follows x^3 for the interval [0, 1]. As both x and x^3 are increasing functions on their respective intervals, and since x = x^3 at the endpoint x = 1, the range of f(x) on the interval [0, 2] will combine both intervals' ranges without any gaps.   Therefore, the range is from the minimum value at x = 0 to the maximum value at x = 2, which gives us the interval [0, 2] for f(x). However, we must be cautious, as the function is not x nor x^3 alone, but a combination. The highest value on [0, 1] is reached at x=1, and the value is f(1) = 1^3 = 1. The highest value for the entire range of [0, 2] is f(2) = 2, hence the function reaches its maximum at 2 for the interval [0, 2]. So, the correct range of f(x) on the interval [0, 2] is [0, 2], and therefore the right option would be boxed{A. [0, 4]}, but as seen from the initial solution provided, the choice appears to be C. To clarify this discrepancy, we need to consider the two cases for x < 1 and x geq 1 again: Recalculating, for x < 1: f(x) = x^3, the maximum is at x = 1, hence f(1) = 1^3 = 1. For x geq 1: f(x) = x, the maximum is at x = 2, hence f(2) = 2. The maximum value obtained in the interval [0, 2] is 2. However, if we carefully look at the value of f(x) at exactly x = 2, using the definition of the operation \\"a ⊕ b\\", we get 1 ⊕ 2 = 2^2. Now, computing f(2) again correctly for the range, we have: f(2) = (1 ⊕ 2) cdot 2 = 2^2 cdot 2 = 4 cdot 2 = 8.  The highest value f(x) reaches on the interval [0, 2] is boxed{8}, leading us to reevaluate our previous answer and determine that option boxed{C.

A counterexample is a kite, which can have two pairs of congruent diagonals without being a parallelogram. Therefore, statement A is incorrect because it implies a condition that does not necessarily lead to being a parallelogram. **Statement B**: A quadrilateral with all interior angles congruent. This means each interior angle is 90^circ, suggesting it might be a rectangle. However, having all angles congruent (each being 90^circ) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a quadrilateral to be a rectangle; it could also be a square. Thus, statement B is incorrect because it does not exclusively define a rectangle. **Statement C**: A quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides and congruent diagonals. This description fits a rectangle, as rectangles have congruent diagonals and at least one pair of parallel sides (in fact, two pairs). This statement is correct and does not meet the criteria for being incorrect. **Statement D**: A quadrilateral with all sides congruent. This condition describes a rhombus, as all sides being congruent is a defining property of a rhombus. However, a square also has all sides congruent and would fit this description, making statement D incorrect because it implies that any quadrilateral with all sides congruent must be a rhombus, overlooking the square. Given the analysis, the incorrect statement about quadrilaterals, based on the criteria provided, is: boxed{C} - A quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides and congruent diagonals is a rectangle.

When the second train starts at 10 am, the first train is already ( v ) km away from Mumbai. Both trains will now cover the remaining distance to the meeting point, which is ( 200 - v ) km away for the first train. The second train travels at 50 kmph and needs to cover 200 km to reach the meeting point. The time it takes for the second train to reach the meeting point is the distance divided by its speed: [ text{Time for second train} = frac{200}{50} = 4 text{ hours} ] In these 4 hours, the first train will also be traveling towards the meeting point. Since both trains meet at the same time, the first train also travels for 4 hours after the second train starts. The distance the first train covers in these 4 hours is ( 4v ) km (because it travels at ( v ) kmph for 4 hours). Adding this to the ( v ) km it traveled in the first hour, the total distance the first train travels until the meeting point is ( v + 4v = 5v ) km. We know that the first train meets the second train at a distance of 200 km from Mumbai, so: [ 5v = 200 ] Now, we can solve for ( v ): [ v = frac{200}{5} ] [ v = 40 text{ kmph} ] Therefore, the speed of the first train is boxed{40}  kmph."},{"instruction":"Let  I  and  H  be the incenter and orthocenter of an acute triangle  ABC .

They make 4 cars, and sell each car for 50.  So, the total revenue from selling cars is 4 cars * 50/car = 200.

The cost of materials for motorcycles per month is 250. They make 8 motorcycles, and we need to find out the selling price of each motorcycle, let's call it x. The total revenue from selling motorcycles is 8 motorcycles * x dollars/motorcycle. The profit from selling motorcycles is the total revenue minus the cost of materials, which is (8x - 250). We are told that they make 50 more profit per month selling motorcycles instead of cars. So, the profit from motorcycles is 100 (profit from cars) + 50.

A. Triangular Pyramid    B. Square Pyramid    C. Pentagonal Pyramid    D. Hexagonal Pyramid","output":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometrical properties associated with a right pyramid whose base edges are equal to its lateral edges. For a right pyramid with an n-sided polygon as its base, the length of the lateral edges being equal to the base edges implies that the slant height of the pyramid is equal to the base edge length. Since the lateral faces are isosceles triangles (due to equal lateral edge lengths), each face will be equilateral if the side of the base is also equal to the slant height. For a triangular pyramid (triangular base), the base is a triangle, and having equal slant heights is possible because the center of the triangle where the height from the apex meets the base can be equidistant from all three vertices. Hence, a triangular pyramid can have equal slant heights (and consequently equal base edges and lateral edges). For a square pyramid (square base), if we were to try and make the slant heights equal to the base edge length, we would find that the center of the square (where the height from the apex meets the base) is not equidistant from all four vertices. In fact, the distance from the center to a vertex (which would be the slant height if the pyramid were right) is longer than the side of the square due to the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, it is NOT possible for a square pyramid to have both equal base edges and lateral edges. This is the correct answer to the question. For a pentagonal pyramid (pentagonal base) and a hexagonal pyramid (hexagonal base), similar logic applies as with the triangular pyramid. It is possible for the slant heights to be equal to the base edges if the height from the apex meets the center of the base at a point equidistant from all vertices. Therefore, the pyramid that cannot have both equal edge length of the base and equal lateral edge length is the square pyramid (B).

The area of the hall is given by the formula: Area = Length × Breadth For the hall: Area = 36 m × 15 m Area = 540 m² Now, we need to convert the length of each stone from decimeters (dm) to meters (m) to match the units of the hall's area. There are 10 decimeters in a meter, so: Length of each stone = 6 dm = 6/10 m = 0.6 m The total area covered by 1800 stones is equal to the area of the hall, which is 540 m². So, the area covered by one stone is: Area of one stone = Total area of hall / Number of stones Area of one stone = 540 m² / 1800 Area of one stone = 0.3 m² Now we have the area of one stone and the length of one stone, we can find the breadth of one stone by using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length × Breadth Rearranging the formula to solve for the breadth: Breadth = Area / Length For one stone: Breadth = Area of one stone / Length of one stone Breadth = 0.3 m² / 0.6 m Breadth = 0.5 m Therefore, the breadth of each stone is boxed{0.5}  meters (or 5 decimeters)."},{"instruction":"As shown in the figure, the center of the hyperbola is at the origin ( O ), and the foci are on the ( x )axis.

We know that for a hyperbola with its foci on the x-axis, the distance between each focus and the center is c. For this problem, we have c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Given that c = sqrt{6}, this leads to a^2 + b^2 = 6. The point P(-5, 2) lies on the hyperbola, so its coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola's equation.

However, since a^2 + b^2 = 6 and c^2 = a^2 + b^2, a^2 cannot be 30 as that would exceed c^2 = 6. Therefore, a^2 = 5. Substitute a^2 = 5 back into the first equation: 5 + b^2 = 6, b^2 = 1.

Therefore: [3^n = 243] [n = 5] So, n = boxed{5}. # (ii) Finding the Constant Term if It Exists: For the expansion (2x^4 + frac{1}{x})^5, the general term is: [T_{r+1} = C_5^r cdot (2x^4)^{5-r} cdot left(frac{1}{x}right)^r = C_5^r cdot 2^{5-r} cdot x^{20-5r}] Setting the exponent of x to zero for a constant term: [20 - 5r = 0 implies r = 4] The constant term is then: [T_5 = C_5^4 cdot 2^1 cdot x^0 = 10] Thus, the constant term is boxed{10}.  Choosing Option ③: # (i) Finding n: Given that the binomial coefficients of the 4th and 5th terms in the expansion are equal, we have: [C_n^3 = C_n^4] Solving this equation gives us n = 7. Therefore, n = boxed{7}. # (ii) Checking for a Constant Term: For the expansion (2x^4 + frac{1}{x})^7, the general term is: [T_{r+1} = C_7^r cdot (2x^4)^{7-r} cdot left(frac{1}{x}right)^r = C_7^r cdot 2^{7-r} cdot x^{28-5r}] Setting the exponent of x to zero for a constant term: [28 - 5r = 0 implies r = 5.6] Since r must be an integer for a binomial coefficient, there is no constant term because r = 5.6 is not an integer.

Let ( N ) be the number of players, and let ( M = leftlfloor frac{N}{2} rightrfloor ). Define players who ranked in the first ( M ) places as strong, and the others as weak (positions with equal scores are assigned arbitrarily). Let ( X ) be the number of correct games between strong and weak players. 2. The total points accumulated by strong players in matches among themselves is ( frac{M(M-1)}{2} ), and in matches against weak players, it is at most ( X ).

Therefore:    [    S_1 > frac{S_1 + S_2}{2} = frac{N(N-1)}{4},    ]    which leads to:    [    X geq S_1 - frac{M(M-1)}{2} > frac{N(N-1)}{4} - frac{M(M-1)}{2}.    ] 5.

Now, consider the case when ( N ) is odd. The average result of a strong player is ( frac{S_1}{M} ). Clearly, it's greater than the average result of a weak player, thus greater than the overall average:    [    frac{S_1}{M} > frac{N(N-1)/2}{N},    ]    leading to:    [    S_1 > frac{M(N-1)}{2}.    ]    Therefore:    [    X geq S_1 - frac{M(M-1)}{2} > frac{M(N-M)}{2} > frac{N(N-1)}{8}.    ]    This final inequality verifies that the number of correct games is greater than ( frac{N(N-1)}{8} ), as established for ( M = frac{N-1}{2} ).

This forms a new table where every player has equal points. 3. To make the score totals unequal, swap critical results, replacing wins against participants of group ( k+1 ) with draws against participants of group ( k+1-i ); hence, decreasing each player's score in the ( k+1 ) group by ( i/2 ), and increasing scores for the ( k+1-i ) group by ( i/2 ).

We can do this by using the time it takes for the train to pass a signal pole, which is a fixed point. The train is 300 meters long and it takes 18 seconds to pass the signal pole. Therefore, the speed of the train (v) can be calculated using the formula: v = distance / time v = 300 meters / 18 seconds v = 16.67 meters/second (rounded to two decimal places) Now that we have the speed of the train, we can use it to find the length of the platform. The train takes 39 seconds to cross the platform. During this time, the train covers the length of itself plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the platform as L. The total distance covered by the train while crossing the platform is: Total distance = length of train + length of platform Total distance = 300 meters + L We know the speed of the train and the time it takes to cross the platform, so we can use the formula: Total distance = speed * time (300 + L) meters = 16.67 meters/second * 39 seconds Now we can solve for L: 300 + L = 16.67 * 39 300 + L = 650.13 meters (rounded to two decimal places) Now, subtract the length of the train from the total distance to find the length of the platform: L = 650.13 - 300 L = 350.13 meters Therefore, the length of the platform is approximately boxed{350.13}  meters."},{"instruction":"Two angles of an isosceles triangle measure 60^circ and x^circ.
