Possible answers: have friends, ignore everyone, study hard Answer:","output":"In the given context, the most plausible action that Aubrey would desire to undertake next is to make new friends at her new school. Missing her old friends indicates her attachment to and appreciation for close social connections in her life. Due to her affection for her old friends, it is unlikely that she would choose to ignore everyone, as it seems contradictory to her personality and social inclinations. Aubrey may also understand the importance and value of friendship in enhancing her school experience, as friends provide a sense of belonging, support, and comfort that can have a significant impact on her emotional, social, and academic well-being. Therefore, the desire to have friends can be considered essential for Aubrey to successfully adapt to her new environment and feel confident in navigating new challenges that may come her way. While it is possible that Aubrey might recognize the need to study hard to excel in her new educational setting, it is likely that her sense of belonging and social support will have a significant influence on her motivation, focus, and perseverance to perform academically. By establishing friendships at her new school, Aubrey can form a strong social foundation, making it easier for her to concentrate on her studies and seek help from others when needed. In summary, Aubrey's next course of action would most likely involve making new friends at her new school. Building new relationships will not only help her overcome the grief of missing her old friends but also provide her with the necessary support system to successfully navigate her academic and extracurricular activities. As a result, she will gradually adjust to her new environment, maintaining a balance between social connections and academic achievements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What does the janitor discover? Title: Harakiri Movie plot: Edo, 1630. Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, HanshirÅ's closest friend performed seppuku and left a letter assigning to HanshirÅ the guardianship of his teenage sonâMotome.

Possible A: jail, floor, front door, reporter, porch  Why is \\"jail\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"The answer \\"jail\\" is aligned with human common sense due to various factors presented in the question. To understand why \\"jail\\" is the most appropriate answer among the options given - jail, floor, front door, reporter, and porch - let's analyze the context provided in the question. Context: The newspaper was his only connection to the outside world while doing time where? 1. Connection to the outside world: The statement mentions a connection to the outside world, implying that the subject is in a situation or place where they are isolated or cut off from the broader society.  2. Doing time: The phrase \\"doing time\\" is a common colloquial expression that refers to serving a sentence in a correctional facility, more specifically, a jail or prison. Considering these factors, we can analyze the given options: a) Jail: Given the limited access to the outside world and the use of the phrase \\"doing time,\\" jail is the most appropriate location fitting the context. In a jail or prison, an inmate's access to the outside world is restricted, and they may rely heavily on newspapers for information and connection to events happening in society. b) Floor: The floor doesn't fit the context as it isn't a location where one serves a sentence or has limited connection to the outside world. c) Front door: Similar to the floor, a front door is not associated with serving time or restricting access to the outside world. d) Reporter: A reporter is a person, not a place where someone serves time or has limited connection to the outside world. e) Porch: While being on a porch may allow for some limited connection to the outside world, it does not align with the phrase \\"doing time,\\" which indicates serving a sentence. Given the contextual analysis of the question, it is clear that \\"jail\\" aligns with human common sense as the most appropriate answer based on the situation described - limited access to the outside world while serving a sentence. This choice reflects an understanding of colloquial expressions like \\"doing time\\" and the implications within the context provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig? ?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Q: What is the process of making atp without oxygen called?   A: Select from: (1). condensation; (2). photosynthesis; (3). Cell Division; (4). fermentation; Answer:","output":"The process of making ATP without oxygen is called fermentation (option 4). Fermentation is an anaerobic process, meaning it occurs in the absence of molecular oxygen, and converts carbohydrates, such as glucose and other monosaccharides, into energy and other byproducts. The energy generated during this process comes in the form of ATP, Adenosine Triphosphate. ATP is the primary molecule that stores and transfers energy within cells. Since fermentation occurs in an anaerobic environment, it is essential for organisms that thrive in oxygen-deprived environments, as well as for multicellular organisms during intense physical activity, which can lead to temporary oxygen deficiency. There are two main types of fermentation: 1. Lactic acid fermentation: This type of fermentation occurs in muscles, bacteria such as Lactobacillus, and fungi. During this process, glucose is converted into lactate. Lactic acid fermentation is responsible for the sour taste in yogurt and the accumulation of lactic acid in muscles during intense exercise, leading to muscle fatigue and soreness. 2. Alcoholic fermentation: This type of fermentation occurs in yeasts and some bacteria. During this process, glucose is converted into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. Alcoholic fermentation is used in the production of alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine, and in baking as the carbon dioxide produced helps to leaven the dough. The fermentation process begins with the breakdown of glucose through a series of chemical reactions called glycolysis, during which glucose is converted into a molecule called pyruvate and a small amount of ATP is generated. After glycolysis, the process diverges depending on the type of fermentation taking place (lactic acid or alcoholic fermentation). In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is converted to lactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase, while in alcoholic fermentation, pyruvate is first decarboxylated to acetaldehyde by pyruvate decarboxylase and then converted to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase. Both of these processes regenerate molecules called NAD+ which can then be used in glycolysis for the generation of ATP. Though fermentation generates less ATP compared to aerobic cellular respiration, it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular energy levels under anaerobic conditions. If oxygen is present, cells tend to switch to aerobic respiration, which generates more ATP and is more efficient. However, fermentation allows cells and organisms to survive and maintain their metabolism during temporary or permanent oxygen limitations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The conversation only provides limited information about their plans to attend a lecture and Becky's need to discuss something with Sam in person near the library.  However, we can still analyze the conversation and make some assumptions about the context and the nature of their discussion. Here is a more detailed analysis: 1. Attending a lecture: From the conversation, we can infer that there might be a scheduled lecture that both Becky and Sam are planning to attend. The nature or topic of the lecture, however, is not clear from the dialogue. 2. Meeting location: Becky suggests that they meet near the library, indicating that the location is likely near their educational institution, such as a college or university campus. 3. Importance of face-to-face communication: Becky insists on speaking with Sam only in person and not through text or phone call. This indicates that the topic she wants to discuss is potentially sensitive, confidential, or personal. 4. Urgency: From the dialogue, the topic Becky wants to discuss might be time-sensitive or of importance, as she does not want to share it through other means of communication and prefers to discuss it before or after the lecture. To summarize, while we cannot deduce the exact topic of conversation between Becky and Sam, we can conclude that it might be related to their academic or personal lives, and is significant enough for them to discuss it in person.

He was abusive and too young to be married with a child. They got divorced shortly after. A couple years later she met a man named Rob. He was fun, loving, kind, great with me, everything she had been looking for. They dated for.. a few months I think? Maybe a year. Then they got married and we moved to Texas. They were married for 5 years and she was just as miserable those 5 years. He was mean, he lied about everything, he was addicted to porn and stole from his job. He was controlling and wouldn’t let anyone else handle money. It was a rough house to grow up in and hard on my mom as she tried to keep me from the abuse. Eventually he cheated on her with one of her best friends and she kicked him out. I didn’t even notice he was gone for a week because he was so absent in my life. He apologized, turned into the man she first met and they tried again. He again cheated on her and she left him again, that time for good. They ended up finalizing the divorce a year later. I remember her telling me that she confronted him about his change of character and he had told her “Everyone puts on an act at first.” As if it was a normal thing. He had depression and I believe he wanted everyone to be just as miserable as he was. After they got divorced he had on and off again relationships, got a girl pregnant and got married, then she divorced him. He lived with his cousin for a while.

Widespread Roman interference in the Greek world was probably inevitable given the general manner of the ascendency of the Roman Republic. This Roman-Greek interaction began as a consequence of the Greek city-states located along the coast of southern Italy. Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule. Although they initially resisted, allying themselves with Pyrrhus of Epirus, and defeating the Romans at several battles, the Greek cities were unable to maintain this position and were absorbed by the Roman republic. Shortly afterwards, Rome became involved in Sicily, fighting against the Carthaginians in the First Punic War. The end result was the complete conquest of Sicily, including its previously powerful Greek cities, by the Romans. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Sicily was won by whom in the First Punic war?","output":"Yes, there is an answer to this question.

However, the sentences are phrased slightly differently. In the first sentence, \\"Moore of Alabama says he will appeal his case to the nation 's highest court,\\" the focus is on Moore, who is communicating his decision to appeal his case. The phrase \\"the nation's highest court\\" refers to the Supreme Court of the United States, which is the country's highest court of law. In the second sentence, \\"Moore has said he plans to appeal the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court,\\" the wording is slightly different, but the meaning remains the same. Moore is still communicating his intent to appeal the case, but this sentence uses the term \\"U.S. Supreme Court,\\" which is a direct reference to the nation's highest court, as opposed to the more general term \\"the nation's highest court\\" used in the first sentence.

England cricketer, James Taylor plays for which county side?","output":"James Taylor, a former English cricketer, played for the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club during his professional career. Born on January 6, 1990, in Nottingham, England, James William Arthur Taylor made his First-Class debut for Leicestershire in 2008, a team he represented until the end of the 2011 season. As a talented batsman, he gained early recognition and earned the opportunity to represent England Lions during this time as well. It was in 2012 when Taylor made the switch to Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, where he went on to script some memorable performances. In 2013, he scored his maiden double-century for Nottinghamshire against Sussex. The following year, he produced another fabulous knock by scoring 291 against Sussex, which is the fourth-highest individual score in Nottinghamshire's history. During his time with Nottinghamshire, Taylor also made his international debut for the England cricket team across all three formats – Test, ODI, and T20I. Unfortunately, in April 2016, Taylor retired from professional cricket at the age of 26 due to a severe heart condition known as Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Though his career was cut short, Taylor has remained associated with cricket. He has since taken up a role as an England national team selector and has also worked as a cricket commentator and analyst.

President Barack Obama declared Friday that Sony \\"made a mistake\\" in shelving the satirical... (Associated Press)      Obama described the hacking case as a \\"very costly, very expensive\\" example of cybervandalism, but did not call it an act of war. In trying to fashion a proportionate response, the president said the U.S. would examine the facts to determine whether North Korea should find itself back on the terrorism sponsors list.      \\"We're going to review those through a process that's already in place,\\" Obama told CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" in an interview to air Sunday. \\"I'll wait to review what the findings are.\\"      North Korea spent two decades on the list until the Bush administration removed it in 2008 during nuclear negotiations. Some lawmakers have called for the designation to be restored following the hack that led Sony to cancel the release of a big-budget film that North Korea found offensive.      Only Iran, Sudan, Syria and Cuba remain on the list, which triggers sanctions that limit U.S. aid, defense exports and certain financial transactions.      But adding North Korea back could be difficult. To meet the criteria, the State Department must determine that a country has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, a definition that traditionally has referred to violent, physical attacks rather than hacking.      Obama also leveled fresh criticism against Sony over its decision to shelve \\"The Interview,\\" despite the company's insistence that its hand was forced after movie theaters refused to show it.      While professing sympathy for Sony's situation, Obama suggested he might have been able to help address the problem if given the chance.      \\"You know, had they talked to me directly about this decision, I might have called the movie theater chains and distributors and asked them what that story was,\\" Obama said.      Sony's CEO has disputed that the company never reached out, saying he spoke to a senior White House adviser about the situation before Sony announced the decision. White House officials said Sony did discuss cybersecurity with the federal government, but that the White House was never consulted on the decision not to distribute the film.      \\"Sometimes this is a matter of setting a tone and being very clear that we're not going to be intimidated by some, you know, cyberhackers,\\" Obama said. \\"And I expect all of us to remember that and operate on that basis going forward.\\"      North Korea has denied hacking the studio, and on Saturday proposed a joint investigation with the U.S. to determine the true culprit. The White House rejected the idea and said it was confident North Korea was responsible.      But the next decision — how to respond — is hanging over the president as he vacations with his family in Hawaii.      Obama's options are limited.

Each year, this butterfly travels about 3000miles to its winter home in central Mexico . How can it fly so far? And why does it make this long and dangerous trip? Scientists still don't have an answer. For many years, people in Mexico wondered where the orange-and-black butterflies came from every winter. Then, in 1937, a scientist started to follow and study the butterflies. For the next 20 years, he discovered that one butterfly started its journey in Canada. Four months later, it arrived in Mexico. The length of the butterflies find their way back to the same place? Another amazing thing is that the butterflies always return to the same area in central Mexico. How do the butterflies find their way back to the same place? This is an interesting question because only every fourth generation makes the trip south. In other words, the butterfly that travels to Mexico this year is the great-great-grandchild of the butterfly that traveled there last year. Each year, four generations of a Monarch butterfly family are born. Each generation of the family has a very different life. The first generation is born in the south in late April. It slowly moves north, reproduces , and then dies. On the trip north,two more generations are born, reproduce, and die. Each of these generations of butterflies is born. This generation has a much longer life. It lives for about eight months. This generation of butterflies makes the amazing journey back to the winter home of its great-great-grandparents. The butterflies spend the winter there, and in the spring they reproduce and then die. Their offspring will be the first generation of the next circle of life. Today, people are still studying the Monarch butterfly. But they are not clear about everything. Answer:","output":"What is the most remarkable aspect of the Monarch butterflies' journey from eastern Canada to central Mexico? A. The Monarch butterflies travel 3,000 miles each year B.

Hans Lundgren was born on 3 November 1957 in Spanga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (nee Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spanga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Angermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren resides in Los Angeles, California. He speaks Swedish and English, as well as smaller amounts of French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, but is not fluent in five languages as has often been reported.  He is an avid football fan. He supported Everton FC when he lived in Europe, but developed more of an interest in international football tournaments (such as the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup) after moving to Los Angeles.  During the 1980s, Lundgren had relationships with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella so much that they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000.  In early May 2009, Lundgren's Marbella home was reportedly broken into by three masked burglars who tied up and threatened his wife, but fled when they found a family photo and realized that the house was owned by Lundgren. Lundgren later stated he believed the intruders to be Eastern European and had asked contacts in Bulgaria to investigate them, but to no avail. After the incident, Lundgren's elder daughter, Ida, suffered from PTSD. His wife was the \\"most traumatized\\", and as of 2011, they are divorced.  Lundgren currently lives in Los Angeles, California. He broke up with his girlfriend, Jenny Sandersson, in 2014 and it was said that they were secretly engaged and married later.","output":"This text is about Hans Lundgren, also known as Dolph Lundgren, a Swedish actor, filmmaker, and martial artist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When it comes, people from around the world, including 5,000 in the small town today, watch this tongue-twisting  small town for a sign from one groundhog that supposedly predicts when that years' spring will arrive. If it's a cloudy day outside when the groundhog _ from its cave, then spring will arrive early that year. However, if it is sunny outside, the groundhog will supposedly be scared by its own shadow, hiding underground for six more weeks of cold weather. Of course, Punxsutawney Phil's prediction is no more able to guarantee the extended forecast than your local weatherman. ABC News reports that an analysis by the National Climate Data Center found that Phil's predictions are more often wrong than right. Philis is also found to have made some unpleasant predictions. Ever since 1887, he has predicted 99 extended winters and just 16 early springs .Nine of the years' predictions were unavailable, according to ABC. The holiday began as a German tradition in 18th century and became even more of a cultural phenomenon after the 1993 film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray. Punxsutawney Phil has become a celebrity in his own right.  Each year, the fatter animal with long teeth is watched by millions as he emerges from a cave in the town he is named after.

Pick your answer from:  (A). yes;  (B). it is not possible to tell;  (C). no;","output":"(B). it is not possible to tell; The scenario presented in the premise depicts a boy wearing a golden crown and a white robe. The hypothesis suggests that the boy is pretending to be a prince. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is an assumption, and it is difficult to determine whether the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise. To clarify, the boy's attire, consisting of a golden crown and a white robe, could signify several possibilities. These include: 1. Cultural dressing: The boy might be wearing the attire because it is traditional or cultural clothing in his community. It could represent a celebration or ceremony, and the attire might have symbolic significance in local customs. In this case, the boy might not be pretending to be a prince. 2. Performance: The attire might belong to a costume the boy is wearing for a theatrical performance or a school play. In this scenario, he may portray a prince as part of a fictional story or historical reenactment, but this does not constitute \\"pretending\\" in the same sense implied by the hypothesis. 3. Personal enjoyment or expression: The boy might have a personal fascination with royal attire, or he could be dressing up for his self-expression. This scenario could support the hypothesis that the boy was pretending to be a prince, but more information would be required to confirm this. It is important to note that there could be other explanations behind the boy wearing a golden crown and white robe.

Answer the following question: Process: - Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock - The wind or water deposits tiny rocks - The rocks become known as sediment - The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top - Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve - Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock.  Question: suppose calm weather patterns happens, how will it affect More rocks will turn into minerals.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"In the given process, wind and water play a critical role in breaking down rocks into smaller pieces and depositing them as sediment. The eventual formation of new rocks from these sediments relies on these weather patterns that contribute to the wearing and transportation of rock particles. Supposing calm weather patterns occur, the frequency and intensity of wind and water erosion processes will be significantly reduced. Calm weather patterns generally translate to less wind, precipitation, and wave activity, which subsequently means that fewer small pieces will be broken off from rocks. This decrease in erosion due to calm weather patterns will directly affect the amount of sediment being deposited and available for the formation of new rocks. As a result of the calm weather patterns, less sediment will be produced, and therefore, fewer layers of sediment will be pressed together by other layers on top. This reduction in the number of layers being compacted will lead to a decrease in the number of new rocks formed, and ultimately, a reduction in the amount of minerals created from these rocks in the given process. To address the second effect mentioned, which involves the dissolving of minerals from the rocks in the sediment and their role in gluing the sediment together into a single rock, the calm weather patterns will have a clear impact. With less sediment being deposited due to the quieter weather conditions, there will be fewer rocks undergoing the process of dissolution and mineralization. This will lead to a reduction in the amount of minerals available to glue the sediment together, thus resulting in fewer new rocks being formed. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of calm weather patterns will have a \\"less\\" effect on the second part of the process mentioned, as it is directly influenced by the amount of sediment being deposited, which in turn is significantly impacted by the weather conditions. The reduction in weather-driven erosion processes will lead to a decrease in sediment production, ultimately resulting in a diminished quantity of minerals being formed from rocks and less new rock formation overall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic.

The Smothers Brothers are Thomas (\\"Tom\\" - born February 2, 1937) and Richard (\\"Dick\\" - born November 20, 1939), American singers, musicians, and comedians. The brothers' trademark double act was performing folk songs (Tommy on acoustic guitar, Dick on string bass), which usually led to arguments between the siblings. Tommy's signature line was, \\"Mom always liked you best!\\" Tommy (the elder of the two) acted \\"slow\\", and Dick, the straight man, acted \\"superior\\". The brothers were both born on Governors Island in New York Harbor, where their father, Thomas B. Smothers, Jr., a West Point graduate and U.S. Army officer, was stationed. Tom was born on February 2, 1937, and Dick was born on November 20, 1939. Major Smothers served in the 45th Infantry Regiment (United States) and died during World War II, while being transported from a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Fukuoka, Japan, to a POW camp in Mukden, Manchukuo. They were raised by their mother in the Los Angeles area.  They graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, and attended San Jose State University. After a brief time in a folk group called the Casual Quintet, the brothers made their first professional appearance as a duo in February 1959 at The Purple Onion in San Francisco. They were a popular act in clubs and released several successful top 40 albums for Mercury Records, the most successful being Curb Your Tongue, Knave! in 1964.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? David Cameron last night joked that ‘assassination’ would be a ‘welcome release’ from the pressure of keeping Scotland in the UK – as the battle over independence raged ahead of tomorrow’s vote. The Prime Minister made the crass remarks at a  Downing Street gathering last night as the polls showed Scotland’s future in the Union hanging by a thread. Mr Cameron also decided against a last-minute campaign trip north of the border today – leaving his former adversary Gordon Brown to do the heavy lifting for the ‘No’ campaign while he dropped off his children at school and  visited a factory in Hampshire to highlight Britain’s plummeting unemployment. ‘The vote tomorrow is whether you want to break and sever every link, and I say let's keep our UK pensions, let's keep our","output":"UK armed forces, let's keep our UK passports, and let's stand together against the challenges the world throws at us,’ Mr Cameron said. In an attempt to counter the pro-independence movement, he emphasized the benefits of maintaining the Union, stating that pooled resources and shared history would be an advantage in the face of global difficulties. However, his lighthearted approach to the subject with the ‘assassination’ remark was met with mixed responses, with some critics arguing it undermined the gravity of the situation. In contrast, supporters of Mr Cameron saw it as a display of wit and a moment of relief during such a tense time. Despite not making a last-minute trip to Scotland, the Prime Minister remained in constant contact with his team and closely monitored the situation, relying on proxy voices like former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to rally support for the ‘No’ campaign. Ultimately, the referendum would decide the fate of Scotland and its place within the United Kingdom, with Mr Cameron and other Union supporters urging the Scottish people to consider the long-term consequences of independence before casting their votes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Given a scientific question and its correct answer, generate supporting facts for the answer. This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Q: Question: Regulatory proteins bind to regulatory elements to control what? Answer: transcription A:","output":"Task: In this task, you need to generate supporting facts that explain how regulatory proteins binding to regulatory elements control transcription. Here are the guidelines on how to do this: 1. Understand the question: The question is about the mechanism by which regulatory proteins control transcription by binding to regulatory elements.   2. Define key terms:     - Regulatory proteins: These are proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression.    - Regulatory elements: These are DNA sequences that influence the expression of one or multiple genes.    - Transcription: It is the process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA, which will then be further processed or translated into a protein. 3. Research and generate supporting facts:    - Fact 1: Regulatory proteins, also known as transcription factors, bind to specific regulatory element sequences in the DNA, allowing them to turn gene expression on or off.    - Fact 2: Transcription initiates when RNA polymerase binds to a specific DNA sequence called the promoter, assisted by regulatory proteins.    - Fact 3: Depending on their function, regulatory proteins can either enhance or inhibit transcription. Activators enhance transcription by recruiting the RNA polymerase to the promoter, while repressors hinder the binding of RNA polymerase, inhibiting transcription.    - Fact 4: In eukaryotic cells, transcription factors can also modify the structure of chromatin, making the DNA more or less accessible to RNA polymerase, thus regulating transcription.    - Fact 5: Regulatory elements and transcription factors are crucial in controlling gene expression, making sure that the right genes are expressed in the correct amount and the right time during an organism's development and in response to environmental stimuli. 4. Use these supporting facts to explain the given answer: - Regulatory proteins bind to regulatory elements to control transcription because they can act as activators or repressors, influencing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, and therefore determine whether a gene will be actively transcribed or not. Their actions are essential in coordinating gene expression in response to various cellular and environmental signals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Plot Summary: Abigail, a well-respected psychiatrist, and Gordon, her childhood friend, dive head-first into a whirlwind of conspiracy, deceit, and supernatural occurrences when their small town is suddenly struck by a wave of inexplicable events. As the town crumbles, their friendship is put to the ultimate test.  Plot:  Act I: Abigail, a highly-touted psychiatrist with a seemingly perfect life, resides in the idyllic coastal town she and Gordon, her childhood friend, grew up in. Abigail has dedicated her career to helping others, and as a result, she is highly respected by her peers and the community as a whole. Gordon, on the other hand, is a struggling writer who often finds solace in the supernatural and has developed an obsession with the occult. One day, a series of inexplicable events begin to unfold in the town. Mysterious disappearances, unnatural deaths, and supernatural occurrences shake the community to its core. Media frenzy and paranoia grip the town as the locals start to point fingers, searching for a source, human or otherwise, to explain these terrifying events. Act II: As the hysteria spreads, Abigail's calm demeanor and concrete reasoning allow her to bat away accusations of any supernatural involvement. However, Gordon's roots in the seemingly obscure occult make him an easy target for the townspeople's suspicion. In an attempt to clear both their names, Abigail and Gordon team up, using their unique skills and insights to delve into the core of the bizarre, dark phenomena engulfing their town. Their investigation uncovers a hidden network of secret societies and dark forces operating in their town, which aims to control the inhabitants for nefarious purposes. Abigail and Gordon discover that the society members participate in sacrificial rituals, made in exchange for their safety and prosperity. They soon narrow down the possible culprits and confront the society's leaders, hoping to expose the truth to the town. In a shocking turn of events, they find out that Abigail's late mentor, Dr. Lancaster, was a core member of this shadowy group. Act III: As the conspiracy unravels, new pieces of evidence start to point toward Abigail's connection to the society. Gordon finds out about Abigail’s mentor's involvement in the group and begins to suspect her motives. Abigail denies any involvement, but doubts begin to seep into their friendship. The trust between Abigail and Gordon starts to recede as Abigail struggles to maintain her innocence. In the climactic confrontation with the secret society's leader, it is revealed that Dr. Lancaster had passed on the leadership mantle to Abigail before his death. Abigail, however, was unaware of this responsibility and had no knowledge of her mentor's dark side. Realizing the web of lies surrounding her, she is left to confront her fate. Feeling utterly betrayed and lost, Gordon turns against Abigail, leaving her to fend for herself against the town's rage and the secret society's deadly ambitions. As their friendship falls apart, Abigail must choose between accepting the leadership role within the secret society or risking everything to fight back, save the town from the darkness, and heal the rift between her and Gordon. The Reckoning of Abigail is a riveting psychological thriller packed with deceit, conspiracy, and the supernatural, forcing two friends to question the very nature of their relationship and morality itself. As old secrets are laid bare, and an entire town's fate hangs in the balance, the plot takes each character on a treacherous journey to expose the truth, even at the cost of their friendship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","output":"Alright, we will solve this math problem together step by step, just like putting puzzle pieces together! We have the equation: 75 * w + 83 * w + 937 - 147 = 0 First, let's add 75 * w and 83 * w together because they both have w.  75w + 83w is like having 75 apples plus 83 apples, for a total of 158 apples. So, we get: 158 * w + 937 - 147 = 0 Now, let's deal with the numbers: 937 - 147.  Imagine you have 937 candies and you ate 147 candies. You will be left with 790 candies. So, our equation now looks like: 158 * w + 790 = 0 Now, we want to get w all by itself. To do this, let's get rid of the 790 by subtracting 790 from both sides: 158 * w = -790 Now we have only one step left. We need to find out what number, when multiplied by 158, will give us -790. To find w, divide both sides by 158: w = -790 ÷ 158 When we divide -790 by 158, we get:  w = -5 And there we have it! The answer is -5. So, w is equal to -5.

As of 2012, there are 26 National Historic Sites of Canada in Winnipeg. One of these, The Forks, attracts four million visitors a year. It is home to the City television studio, Manitoba Theatre for Young People, the Winnipeg International Children's Festival, and the Manitoba Children's Museum. It also features a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) skate plaza, a 8,500-square-foot (790 m2) bowl complex, the Esplanade Riel bridge, a river walkway, Shaw Park, and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. The Winnipeg Public Library is a public library network with 20 branches throughout the city, including the main Millennium Library.Winnipeg the Bear, which would become the inspiration for part of the name of Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn of the Fort Garry Horse. He named the bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg. A. A. Milne later wrote a series of books featuring the fictional Winnie-the-Pooh. The series' illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, displayed in Assiniboine Park.The city has developed many distinct dishes and cooking styles, notably in the areas of confectionery and hot-smoked fish. Both the First Nations and more recent Eastern Canadian, European, and Asian immigrants have helped shape Winnipeg's dining scene, giving birth to dishes such as the desserts schmoo torte and wafer pie.The Winnipeg Art Gallery is Western Canada's oldest public art gallery, founded in 1912. It is the sixth-largest in the country and includes the world's largest public collection of contemporary Inuit art.

The Cardinal informs Lamont (who has had some experience at exorcism, and has been exposed to Merrin's teachings) that Merrin is up on posthumous heresy charges due to his controversial writings. Apparently, Vatican authorities are trying to modernize and do not want to acknowledge that Satan as an actual evil entity exists.Meanwhile, the teenage Regan, although now seemingly normal and staying with her guardian Sharon Spencer in New York while her mother is away on location filming a movie, continues to be monitored at a psychiatric institute by Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher).

Background: Hunter was born in New York City, the son of Gertrude (nee Gelien) and Charles Kelm. His mother, from Hamburg, was a German Roman Catholic immigrant, and his father was Jewish. Hunter's father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) Context: Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song \\"Young Love,\\" which was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.  He had the hit, \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter.  Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, Lafayette Escadrille (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, Gunman's Walk (1958), a film that Hunter considers his favorite role.  Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film Damn Yankees, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.'s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word.  He also starred in They Came to Cordura (1959), with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth. Sidney Lumet starred him opposite Sophia Loren in That Kind of Woman (1959). Question: Did he have any other hits? Answer:","output":"Yes, Tab Hunter had another hit with the song \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK.

Dwight Clark caught the pass thrown by which quarterback known as \\"Joe Cool\\" in the play known simply as \\"The Catch\\"? Answer:","output":"The pass that Dwight Clark caught, famously known as \\"The Catch,\\" was thrown by quarterback Joe Montana. Joe Montana is internationally acclaimed for his American football skills; he is often referred to as \\"Joe Cool,\\" reflecting his under-pressure performance in the football field. This legendary play took place on January 10, 1982, during the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship between the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers. This was a crucial play with just 58 seconds left on the clock. The 49ers were trailing 27-21 against the Cowboys. If the 49ers had failed to score a touchdown, they would have lost the game and their chance at the Super Bowl. The 49ers were on the third down with 3 yards to go for a touchdown from the Dallas Cowboys' 6-yard line. Joe Montana took the snap and rolled to his right. Initially, it appeared as though Montana was going to be sacked or forced out of bounds. However, he ended up throwing the ball toward the back of the end zone. The throw looked like it was going out of bounds. This is when Dwight Clark made his athletic leap, reaching around 10 feet into the air. He managed to catch the football with his fingertips, securing the touchdown. The 49ers won the game with the extra point, taking the score to 28-27. This memorable touchdown came to be simply known as \\"The Catch,\\" and it sealed the 49ers’ victory in what would be a long line of successes during the 1980s. Joe Montana's calm composure under immense pressure gave him his nickname \\"Joe Cool.\\" This pass is a perfect instance demonstrating why he earned this title. His roles in 'The Catch' and his ability to remain emotionally unswerving in high-pressure, high-stakes situations have forever solidified Montana's place in sporting history. This awesomely executed play ultimately led to the 49ers' Super Bowl victory that season and marked the beginning of their tremendous run in the 1980s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Take note of any images, objects, people, or emotions associated with the color red in the dream. This will help provide context for the interpretation. Step 2: Research common meanings of the color red in dreams Research possible meanings of the color red in dreams. Red can symbolize a variety of things including passion, anger, danger, or even positive emotions like love. Understanding the common meanings of the color red can help you narrow down the possible interpretations for your dream. Step 3: Consider your personal associations with the color red Think about your own personal experiences and associations with the color red. These can help you understand the significance of the color in your dream. For example, if you have a significant memory of wearing a red dress to an important event, that memory might be influencing the meaning of your dream. Step 4: Reflect on current emotions or situations in your life Consider any current emotions or situations in your life that may be related to the color red or the overall theme of the dream. For example, if you recently encountered a dangerous or emotionally charged situation, the color red might symbolize that experience in your dream. Step 5: Cross-reference the dream with your dream diary Consult your dream diary for any recurring themes, images, or situations involving the color red. This can help illuminate any patterns or deeper meanings behind the red present in your recent dream. Step 6: Interpret the dream Based on the contextual information from your dream, your research on common meanings of the color red, and your personal associations with the color, interpret your dream as accurately as possible. Keep in mind that dream interpretation is a subjective process, and the meaning of the dream may change as you continue to reflect on its symbolism and significance. Step 7: Review and revise the interpretation as needed As you continue to keep a dream diary, you may discover new insights or patterns related to the color red in your dreams. Be open to revising your interpretation if new information comes to light, and remember that dream interpretation is an ongoing process of personal growth and self-discovery."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Viking metal is a style of heavy metal music characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically seen as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both sung and harsh vocals, a reliance on folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect. Viking metal emerged from black metal during the late 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an opposition to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes in favor of the Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader modern Pagan and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities. Though artists such as Led Zeppelin, Yngwie Malmsteen, Heavy Load, and Manowar had previously dealt with Viking themes, Bathory from Sweden is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums Blood Fire Death (1988) and Hammerheart (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. Enslaved, from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with Hordanes Land (1993) and Vikingligr Veldi (1994). Burzum, Emperor, Einherjer, and Helheim, among others, helped further develop the genre in the early and mid-1990s. As early as 1989 with the founding of the German band Falkenbach, Viking metal began spreading from the Nordic countries to...

Q:Given the following context:  George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856?

But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate  better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his... Options: A Because they can all look grown up in that way.

The writer and a fellow astrometer named Mr. Ogilve travel to the impact site along with several other people to view the mysterious Cylinder. The Cylinder opens and a large, multi-tenticled creature emerges. After a minute, the Martian retreats back into the Cylinder and then a small dish-shaped device appears on the top of the cylinder. The Martians start killing people with a \\"heat ray\\"; a type of weapon that incinerates everyone and everything in its path. Dozens of people, including Ogilve, are burned alive. The writer discovers his house is in range of the Heat Ray and decides to take his wife (Susan Gorforth) and her maid to the comparable safety of her cousins in the nearby town of Leatherhead.

Article: Mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant water, so the first step to reducing the number of mosquitoes on your property is to eliminate as much stagnant water from your property as possible.  Remove any unnecessary basins you may have in your yard, including wheel barrows, buckets, and temporary swimming pools. If these items must remain outside, turn them upside down when not in use. Clear your gutters frequently. They often get clogged with leaves and other debris, which can hold small amounts of water. Even leaves on your lawn can provide enough water for mosquito larvae, so be sure to rake them up promptly. Add topsoil to low areas that tend to accumulate water. In extreme cases, you may need to regrade your yard to improve drainage. If any of your trees have rotted areas where water accumulates, fill the holes with mortar. Sometimes it is not possible to eliminate all standing water. If you have a bird bath or a pond, for example, you can treat the water with larvicides that you can purchase at most gardening or home improvement stores. Most of these products contain either methoprene or Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, neither of which are believed to be toxic to humans, pets, fish, or birds when used appropriately.  Read the directions carefully to determine how often you must reapply the larvicide. Protection can last for a month or more, but it depends on the amount of water being treated. If you have a swimming pool, be sure to treat the water that accumulates on the cover during the off-season. If you have sources of water that cannot be treated, be sure to dump the water out and refill it every few days in order to interrupt the mosquito life cycle. Adult mosquitoes can emerge in less than two weeks after eggs are laid, so never let the water sit for longer than that. If you have items such as outdoor tarps that accumulate small amounts of water, tend to them regularly to ensure that water never stands for more than a few days at a time. If you are aware of possible mosquito breeding grounds that are not on your property, you should report them to the appropriate agency.  Many cities and counties have vector control agencies, which are responsible for controlling the populations of disease-spreading pests. If your area does not have such an agency, report the issue to your local public health department. Whether the area is on public land or private property, the appropriate agency in your area may be able to take steps to remedy the problem. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to reduce the number of mosquitoes in your yard by getting rid of stagnant water where they lay their eggs.

Article: Parents whose children think the latest Nike or Adidas shoes may be better than buying old-fashioned plimsolls   because they encourage a healthier style of running, researchers said. Big companies, like Nike and Adidas, make millions of dollars from selling highly-cushioned shoes  both as fashion and sports shoes. The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way. Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes, it is very difficult to change our technique, even if we remove our shoes, it can raise the risk of injury. Children should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \\"barefoot\\" running style, experts said. Dr Mick Wilknson, who did the research, told the British Science Festival in Newcastle, \\"If I would advise someone on what to give their child, I would say don't go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike, just get them a pair of flexible, flat shoes. Give them basic foot-ware, nothing fancy, nothing particularly cushioned.\\" Running in flat shoes, barefoot, encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running, especially long distances as the human was designed to do. Around the world, and in particular in the US, running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes. Dr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners, he said: \\"Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s, despite claims of improvements in running shoes. That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better.\\" Question: Why are people advised to wear plimsolls? - They have a new fashion - They have better quality. - They are healthier - They are cheaper. A:","output":"People are advised to wear plimsolls because they are healthier. Wearing shoes with thin soles, such as plimsolls, from a young age helps in developing a natural \\"barefoot\\" running style, which encourages the runner to use the front of their foot – a better technique for running, especially for long distances.

Margaret, a once-promising writer, suffers from agoraphobia (fear of open spaces) and manipulates those around her to maintain her isolated and controlled world. Arden, talented and full of dreams, longs to follow in her mother's footsteps as a writer. However, Margaret constantly criticizes and berates Arden's work, using her words as weapons to keep Arden tethered to her. Arden's father left the family years ago, and her only support system is her best friend, Leo, who sees her potential and encourages her to break free from her mother's psychological hold. When Arden is offered a full scholarship to a prestigious writing program in New York City, she initially refuses out of duty to stay and take care of her invalid mother. However, as Margaret's manipulation tactics increase – from feigning illness to accusing Arden of being a heartless daughter – Arden starts to question whether her mother's love is genuine. With Leo's encouragement, Arden seeks help from a therapist who helps her realize the true extent of the emotional abuse she's endured. This leads to an emotional confrontation between Arden and Margaret, where Arden confronts her mother about her behavior and manipulation. Faced with losing her daughter, Margaret is forced to confront the root of her own fears and abusive behavior. Through this process, she reveals to Arden her own abusive upbringing, her literary successes overshadowed by self-doubt, and her belief that she's undeserving of love. Arden, now understanding her mother's pain, challenges her to seek help and begin healing; but she also makes it clear she will not sacrifice her own dreams any longer. With newfound clarity and determination, Arden claims the scholarship and sets off to New York City. Broken Home ends on a bittersweet note as both mother and daughter take the first steps towards independence. Margaret attends her first therapy session, while Arden starts her new life in New York City, ready to chase her dreams and escape the shadow of her toxic home environment. The film concludes with Arden writing a letter of forgiveness to her mother, signifying her liberation from the past and the hope of a better future for both of them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

A higher ratio of these ingredients generally results in a smoother mixture. Once you've adjusted the ingredients and mixed them well, the frosting should be smooth and have a uniform appearance. 2) Add food coloring: To give your frosting a vibrant color, consider incorporating a few drops of food coloring as you beat the ingredients. Be cautious as the more food coloring you use, the darker the color will be. Keep in mind that vanilla extract might create a slightly messier look after ten minutes of beating, so you might want to allow it to simmer longer or stop beating and see if it adds the desired amount of flavor. 3) Achieve the desired consistency: Whip the ingredients continuously until you reach the fluffy and smooth texture that you're aiming for. If your frosting appears too runny, gradually add more powdered sugar to thicken it up. Make sure to mix the powdered sugar thoroughly to prevent any lumps from forming in the frosting. 4) Alternative mixing method: If you don't have a hand mixer or whisk, you can use a fork to beat the sugar, vanilla, and baking soda together until they're well combined. Once you've achieved a smooth mixture, transfer it to an 8 x 8 1/4\\" sized container and cover it with plastic wrap or a lid. Refrigerate the frosting overnight to allow it to set properly.

LCS is a sequence of elements that appears in the same order in both lists (A and B), while not necessarily being consecutive elements. To find the LCS for the given lists, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D matrix (dp) with dimensions (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1). The matrix will store the lengths of LCS for different substrings of A and B. Here are the steps to fill the matrix and find the LCS: 1. Initialize the first row and first column of the matrix dp with 0. This is because if either A or B is an empty list, the LCS length is 0. 2. Loop through the elements of list A (outer loop) and list B (inner loop), comparing the elements at specific positions i and j respectively. 3. If the elements are equal (A[i-1] == B[j-1]), then the LCS includes this element, so we update the dp matrix by adding 1 to the value from the diagonal (dp[i-1][j-1] + 1). 4. If the elements are not equal, then the LCS does not include this pair of elements, and we take the maximum of the previous elements in either row or column (max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])). 5. The value of dp[len(A)][len(B)] will be the length of the longest common subsequence. 6. To find the subsequence itself, we can backtrack through the dp matrix starting from the bottom-right corner, following the appropriate diagonal, left, or up moves depending on the values in the matrix. In the example given, using these steps, we will find the following LCS for lists A and B: ['D', '7133', 'B', 'd', '9235', '2309', 'c', '2707', 'm', 'N', '7615', '1699', 'A']"},{"instruction":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Article: My grandma whom we all called Nanny was a solid, first-generation, Italian immigrant. She came to this country with her family on a tiny ship during World War I when she was only 8 years old. During the trip she survived stormy seas,little food, and an attack by a German U-boat. After getting here,her large family worked hard to build a new life in America. They never had much money but were rich in love. One day,when I was about 5 or 6 years old, my parents and brothers went on a trip. It was just me and Nanny in the house for the weekend. Nanny seemed so happy to be taking care of me all by herself. She made me a special breakfast that first morning. However, all I could do was to complain about how the food was not how Mom always made it. Nanny quietly put down the plate and went into the living room. I followed a minute later and saw that she had tears in her eyes. It was the first time I had ever seen my strong and proud grandmother cry and I was the one who had caused it. I walked over to Nanny, climbed on her lap, and for the first time in my short life I did something else too. I apologized without being told to and asked Nanny to forgive me. She smiled, rubbed my head, and told me I was a good boy even though I didn't feel like one then. That memory just like my Nanny's love will stay in my heart forever. It is a sign of both strength and wisdom. Asking for forgiveness helps us to learn, to grow, and to love.

The equation has two terms with the variable c, -568*c and 514*c. Combine these terms to simplify the equation. 810 = -568*c + 514*c 810 = (-568 + 514)*c 810 = -54 * c Step 2: Isolate the variable c. Now, you need to isolate the variable c on one side of the equation. To do this, you can divide both sides of the equation by -54. 810 / (-54) = (-54*c) / (-54) Step 3: Solve for c.

Step 1: Identify the main point of the statement. The short movie review says, \\"should come with the warning 'for serious film buffs only!'\\" Step 2: Analyze the tone and focus of the statement. In this statement, the critic seems to be emphasizing that the movie is specifically tailored for serious film buffs; meaning that it's potentially not suitable or enjoyable for a more general audience. Step 3: Assess the implication of the statement. The critic's use of the word \\"warning\\" suggests that there is a cautionary element to the review. This implies that the movie may not be universally well-received or enjoyed by everyone. Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment of the statement. Based on my analysis, it appears that the critic has a somewhat mixed or neutral view of the movie. While they acknowledge that the movie might be appreciated by a niche audience of serious film buffs, the language and tone of the review also carry a slightly negative undertone due to the inclusion of a warning. Conclusion: The critic's thinking leans more towards the negative side, as the use of the warning suggests caution for potential viewers who are not serious film buffs. However, the statement also acknowledges that the movie may be well-received by a specific audience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She has no idea that her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), a car salesman, is having an affair with his secretary and that he intends to leave Betty to pursue a relationship with her. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs out of the car dealership. When Betty calls to leave a message about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, her husband tells her to take a different car, as the LeSabre (unknown to Betty) has stolen drugs hidden in the trunk. Two hitmen, Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), show up at the house with Betty's husband. The hitmen torture Betty's husband into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a car, but Wesley scalps him anyway. Betty witnesses the murder and experiences a fugue state, escaping the reality of murder into the comforting fantasy of the soap opera. In her mind, she assumes the identity of one of the characters in the daytime drama, a nurse. That evening, Sheriff Eldon Ballard (Pruitt Taylor Vince), local reporter Roy Ostery (Crispin Glover), and several policemen examine the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems oblivious to the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her. Betty spends the night at her friend's house, sleeping in a child's bedroom with the innocence of a little girl. In the middle of the night, she gets into her car and drives off. Betty's next stop is a bar in Arizona, where the lady bartender talks about her inspiring vacation in Rome, and Betty tells her that she was once engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from A Reason to Love â not the actor who portrays him).

The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

About Explorers Basecamps Photos & Logos Videos FAQ      Explorers            Our Glass Explorer community, which consists of people from all walks of life, actively participates in shaping the future of Glass. With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions. The first Explorers were developers from Google I/O 2012 and people who told us what they would do #ifihadglass. Since then, we've continued to expand the Explorer Program. We’re at the start of a long journey and we’re looking to our Explorers to help us develop this new technology. Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. Reactions range from the curious – “Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – “Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!” Luckily as the Explorer Community grows, so does their collective wisdom. We asked some long-time Explorers for their advice, and here it is: DO’S      Explore the world around you. Glass puts you more in control of your technology and frees you to look up and engage with the world around you rather than look down and be distracted from it. Have a hangout with your friends, get walking directions to a fantastic new restaurant, or get an update on that delayed flight.      Take advantage of the Glass voice commands. Glass can free your hands up to do other things like golfing, cooking, or juggling flaming torches while balancing on a beach ball (but also see Don’ts #2). This is great for looking up how many ounces in a cup while you cook, or taking a one-of-a-kind photo from your unique perspective.      Ask for permission. Standing alone in the corner of a room staring at people while recording them through Glass is not going to win you any friends (see Don’ts #4). The Glass camera function is no different from a cell phone so behave as you would with your phone and ask permission before taking photos or videos of others.      Use screen lock. Glass screen lock works like your smartphone’s screen lock: it passcode-protects your device to help prevent others from using it. If you ever lose your device or have it stolen by a budding online resale entrepreneur, you can turn off Glassware and perform a remote wipe (e.g. factory reset) of the device, removing all your information from the device. All you need to do is go to your MyGlass page on your browser, or the MyGlass App on your phone. Be an active and vocal member of the Glass Explorer Community. The Explorer Program was created in order to have a place where our Explorers can give feedback, share content and communicate with the Glass team. It’s been hugely successful over the past year and this is due to our wonderful group of Explorers. They are constantly sharing their worlds with us and with each other, allowing us to hear and work on all the great feedback and stories our Explorers give us (and, wow, do they give us a lot!).      DON’TS:      Glass-out. Glass was built for short bursts of information and interactions that allow you to quickly get back to doing the other things you love. If you find yourself staring off into the prism for long periods of time you’re probably looking pretty weird to the people around you. So don’t read War and Peace on Glass. Things like that are better done on bigger screens.      Rock Glass while doing high-impact sports. Glass is a piece of technology, so use common sense. Water skiing, bull riding or cage fighting with Glass are probably not good ideas.      Wear it and expect to be ignored. Let’s face it, you’re gonna get some questions. Be patient and explain that Glass has a lot of the same features as a mobile phone (camera, maps, email, etc.). Also, develop your own etiquette. If you’re worried about someone interrupting that romantic dinner at a nice restaurant with a question about Glass, just take it off and put it around the back of your neck or in your bag.      Be creepy or rude (aka, a “Glasshole”). Respect others' privacy and if they have questions about Glass don’t get snappy. Be polite and explain what Glass does and remember, a quick demo can go a long way. In places where cell phone cameras aren’t allowed, the same rules will apply to Glass. If you’re asked to turn your phone off, turn Glass off as well. Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers.                   ||||| Google employees train users in Glass basics at a \\"Basecamp\\" event in Los Angeles in 2013. Philip Montgomery / Google      Google is officially putting the users of its Glass headset on notice with a set of do's and don'ts — not least among which is an unambiguous warning not to be \\"creepy or rude (aka, a \\"Gla**hole).\\"      This isn't the first guide to Glass etiquette — ours came out last May — but it is the first such document from Google. Other than basic tutorials and promotional materials, the company hadn't really weighed in on what you should and shouldn't be doing with the technology.      That's probably because it has been waiting to hear back from its many Glass Explorers, the first cohort of cyber-cyclops to wear the devices out in public. The do's and don'ts are assembled from this group's feedback.      Do use Glass voice commands to look up how many ounces are in a cup while your hands are covered in dough — but don't do that while on a date. Do wear Glass on your morning jog or bike commute — but don't wear it \\"water skiing, bull riding, or cage fighting.\\"      And, of course, don't \\"be creepy or rude\\": \\"Respect others and if they have questions about Glass don't get snappy... In places where cell phone cameras aren't allowed, the same rules apply to Glass... Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other explorers.\\"      Perhaps Google was inspired to publish the list by recent stories of Glass users being asked to leave Seattle bars or ambushed by federal agents in a movie theater. Apparently we still have a lot to learn. ||||| Google, perhaps mindful of some negative reactions to its revolution, offers a dos and don'ts guide. The don'ts mostly revolve around human behavior.      Explorers need etiquette? (Credit: Google)      It's hard being misunderstood.      Sometimes you have to ask yourself: \\"Is it these desperate ingrates who don't see my genius? Or might it be me?\\"      Why did this thought enter my troubled day? Oh, because Google has just released a guide to help its Explorers behave.      In the past, Google has been happy to let its pioneers do their thing. Now, after one or two got a pie in the ear, Google is keen to help the nerds assimilate with the world as it sadly is.      The guide is a series of dos and don'ts. Naturally, the don'ts are more interesting.      The first seems something of a reaction to fears that prolonged use of the device might not be wise. Last week, Google Glass enthusiast Chris Barrett told me how he'd experienced severe headaches when he wore it for any length of time.      The first of Google's new don'ts tells users not to \\"Glass-Out.\\" It explains: \\"Glass was built for short bursts of information and interactions that allow you to quickly get back to doing the other things you love.\\"      And \\"things you love\\" shouldn't include eight hours of creepy photography.      Still, this guide doesn't mention health reasons. Rather: \\"If you find yourself staring off into the prism for long periods of time you're probably looking pretty weird to the people around you.\\"      As if you don't already look pretty weird to the people around you.      While it's helpful of Google's guide to remind people not to wear Glass when playing contact sports, it's clear the company is most concerned about social reaction.      Its third don't reminds Explorers that they will, indeed, be stared at and begs them to be polite.      The last don't seems like the most significant. Don't \\"be creepy or rude (aka, a \\"Glasshole\\").\\"      This might remind the owners of the Lost Lake Cafe in Seattle of the customer who didn't appreciate being asked to take his device off and the fuss that ensued.      Not only was he asked to leave, but the restaurant then described him and his kind as \\"man children stinkin up the joint.\\"      Google seems concerned that Glassholes are stinkin' up the company's hopefully addictive joint. As the guide explains: \\"Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers.\\"      What next?

The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ajola) with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thrilby), a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge.In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headley), executes three rogue drug dealers (Travis Snyders, Chad Phillips) by having them skinned, infused with Slo-Mo and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay (Wood Harris), whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' execution. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, and the Judges fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with miniguns that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. By breaching a damaged outer wall, the Judges become able to call for backup.

Without zoos, most people would never see a real tiger or bear. Secondly, zoos look after the animals very well. The animals are always given food and cleaned on time. In the wild, it is not always possible for an animal to find food, so sometimes it goes hungry. Thirdly, Zoos protect the animals. They give them safe place to live in. In the wild, some kinds of animals are in danger. If there is no zoos, there would be fewer kinds of animals in the world. However, some people think it is unnatural  and unfair to keep wild animals in cages. Some cages are too small for many animals such as bears and tigers. They always look not happy in cages. Wild animals should look for their own food. Anyone would not feel happy if he isn't allowed  to go outside his home and animals don't like it either.

How ‘Clueless’ changed my life I honestly don’t remember the first time I saw “Clueless,” but I know it wasn’t in a theater in 1995, when I was 6 and the PG-13 film, which turns 20 this week, became that summer’s runaway hit. What I can tell you is that I’ve watched it around a bazillion times since then — on VHS, DVD, Netflix — and to it I owe an infant love of fashion that blossomed into a grown-up career. Before “Clueless,” clothes were just things my mom bought to help me not be naked. I had no concept of “fashion” — that is, the system and language of clothing — until Cher Horowitz & Co. showed me the way. One of the most important lessons I learned is in the first two minutes of the film: the famous virtual closet scene. As decadent as Cher’s touch-screen proto-app seemed when I was the 10-year-old owner of maybe five T-shirts, at some point I realized the sequence isn’t as much about the excesses of a Beverly Hills rich girl as it is about giving a damn when getting dressed. The yellow tartan ensemble she ends up choosing reflects effort, an eye for coordination and an attention to detail. Her method is preternatural power-suiting, but the message is simpler: Take pride in your everyday appearance. That unspoken motto shows up in the central narrative as Cher and Dionne’s earnest effort to glamorize the new kid, Tai. “Cher’s main thrill in life is a makeover,” Dee says — and in one jaunty montage we see a grungy misfit turned into a candidate for Most Popular Girl in School. Of course, popularity is hardly the point. From her makeover Tai gains confidence, and I grasped the reality of personal branding. “Clothes don’t make the man”? As if! With the right aesthetic and attitude, you can be anyone you want to be. (Just ask Madonna, Caitlyn Jenner or Marky — err — Mark Wahlberg.) Then there are the designer brands. Via “Clueless” I came to understand labels, and that the names attached to the stuff you put on are of actual people, and they use clothes to communicate ideas. Cher’s white date-night slip, for instance, is Calvin Klein minimalism — and sex-tinged controversy — at its best. That her father, Mel, questions its legitimacy as a dress only furthers the fact. Oh, and Alaïa? Cher was right: the Tunisian-born couturier is way important — and, given his price points, perhaps worth taking a gunshot for. On a surface level, the relationship I have with this female-centric comedy is not exactly the one relished by some of my (real and metaphoric) sisters. I’ve always found shopping a bit tedious, and as a socialized cis boy growing up in the suburbs, there was never a potent drive to wear — at least outside my head — the plaid skirts, sheer shirts, knee-high socks and mini backpacks the film made into trendy must-haves. Thankfully, there was Christian, Cher’s crush, the Cake Boy with timeless style that took a back seat. As a gay man who was closeted until the age of 17, it’s impossible to fully articulate my appreciation for his role — a homosexual teen free of identity struggle, who unabashedly dressed better than the prettiest girls and who was accepted by all of his peers. The voluminous pleated pants and tucked-in tees I champion now are no doubt a subconscious ode to the would-be James Jean. “He always wants things to be beautiful and interesting,” Cher says of her friend in a series of sweet epiphanies at the end. This is why, two decades later, “Clueless” still resonates: I don’t care what anyone says — she was talking about me. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article describes how the movie \\"Clueless\\" significantly influenced the author's life and sparked their interest in fashion. Through the characters, particularly Cher Horowitz, the movie taught the importance of personal branding and investing effort in one's appearance. It also introduced the author to designer brands and their impact on fashion. The presence of Christian, a homosexual character with a strong sense of style, resonated with the author and offered representation and affirmation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options:  *Add a few ice cubes to the laundry machine before starting it to get rid of wrinkles faster.  *Add a few pieces of cat litter to the laundry machine before starting it to get rid of wrinkles faster.","output":"To determine which of these solutions is better for the given goal, I will compare both options and assess their potential effects on wrinkle reduction. Option 1: Add a few ice cubes to the laundry machine before starting it to get rid of wrinkles faster. Step 1: Adding ice cubes to the laundry machine. The ice cubes will quickly melt in hot water (or even warm water) and turn into cold water. Step 2: Assessing the potential effects of cold water on wrinkle reduction. Cold water may help set fabrics in a more relaxed state, which can potentially reduce wrinkles. Additionally, cold water is less likely to shrink clothes, which is a factor when it comes to wrinkling. Option 2: Add a few pieces of cat litter to the laundry machine before starting it to get rid of wrinkles faster. Step 1: Adding cat litter to the laundry machine. Cat litter consists of small pieces that are meant for absorbing liquids and capturing odors, in a controlled environment, such as in a litter box. Step 2: Assessing the potential effects of cat litter on wrinkle reduction. Adding cat litter to the laundry machine doesn't seem to have any direct effect on wrinkle reduction. Moreover, it may actually cause issues like clogging the machine or leaving residue on the clothes. Based on the assessments, Option 1 (adding a few ice cubes to the laundry machine before starting it) seems to be a better solution for the goal of getting wrinkles out of clothes faster. While its effects might not be substantial, it is more likely to contribute positively to wrinkle reduction compared to adding cat litter, which may lead to other issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continental Army. Four years later Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \\"Ghost\\". Benjamin and Gabriel resolve to fight the British, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General Horatio Gates engaging the British Army. Benjamin recognizes the foolishness of the action; sure enough, the Continentals are decisively routed. Benjamin meets his former commanding officer, Colonel Harry Burwell, who makes him colonel of the local colonial militia due to his combat experience. Benjamin is tasked with keeping Lord Cornwallis's regiments pinned south through guerrilla warfare. French Major Jean Villeneuve helps train the militia and promises more French aid. Gabriel asks why Villeneuve and others mention Benjamin's role in something... A:","output":"Benjamin uses a tomahawk to skillfully and brutally kill many soldiers in order to rescue his son, Gabriel, from British forces.

The Daily Mail has uncovered appalling cases of patients dying while on waiting lists or being forced to move to England for life-saving treatment. Over the next few days, our investigation will expose horrifying neglect and a political establishment in denial. Scroll down for video. Health campaigners have demanded an investigation into the Labour-run Welsh NHS. Ed Miliband intends to place running NHS at heart of Labour's election campaign next May - despite the party's dismal record. Despite his party’s dismal record in Wales, Ed Miliband wants to place the running of the NHS at the heart of Labour’s election campaign next May. Yet families whose loved ones have suffered in Welsh hospitals say the situation is even worse than the Mid Staffordshire scandal. The British Medical Association, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru nationalists and Labour MP Ann Clwyd are all demanding an independent inquiry. And a survey out today shows that seven out of ten voters agree. The Mail’s investigation will reveal that:. Yesterday another scandal erupted at the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, where police are investigating claims that staff used furniture to restrain dementia patients. The British Medical Association warned last month that the NHS in Wales was facing ‘imminent meltdown’ and called for an independent investigation. Last year the College of Emergency Medicine wrote to the Welsh health minister warning that casualty units were putting patients at risk. Labour MP Ann Clwyd is among those demanding an independent inquiry into the situation in hospitals. And Sir Bruce Keogh of NHS England wrote to his Welsh counterpart last November warning six hospitals should be probed over ‘persistently high’ mortality rates. Today’s survey, commissioned by the Welsh Conservatives, found that a third of people with recent experience of hospital treatment had encountered problems and nearly one in five felt their concerns were not taken seriously. It found that 71 per cent back an independent inquiry into the NHS and 60 per cent believe their health service has deteriorated over the past five years. Respondents included a retired nurse who complained that senior managers were too afraid to act on bad practice. An orthopaedic consultant who answered the questionnaire said Wales’s NHS was ‘on the verge of becoming a third-world health service’. The research was based on 3,295 responses to a survey posted online and sent to 5,000 homes chosen at random. Gareth Williams has campaigned to expose failings at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University health board in South Wales after his mother Lilian suffered neglect before her death in hospital. ‘I believe the indifference of government ministers in Cardiff is callous,’ said the 54-year-old retired teacher. ‘They can no longer hold up the pretence that there are only isolated concerns in ABMU or Wales. In Wales we are still in denial. I think we are where England was when the Mid Staffs scandal broke.’ Hundreds of patients died through neglect at Stafford Hospital. Mr Williams said he and fellow campaigners have been contacted by seven whistleblower nurses. Miss Clwyd has described how her husband died like a ‘battery hen’ at University Hospital Wales in October 2012. She highlighted high mortality rates at some Welsh hospitals and long waiting times for diagnostic tests. A scandal erupted at the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, yesterday where police are investigating claims that staff used furniture to restrain dementia patients. A spokesman for the Cardiff administration said: ‘The vast majority of people in Wales receive excellent care from our NHS, which is more open, transparent and is subjected to a higher level of scrutiny than any other health service in the UK. If issues are identified, we work quickly to put them right.’ A spokesman for the ABMU health board said: ‘The vast majority of patients receive good quality care – our complaints rate over the past year was 0.15 per cent – but we know that any poor care is unacceptable and we are determined to put things right.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"There are some problems happening in hospitals in Wales, and people are not happy about it. Many patients are not being treated well and some are even dying while waiting for help. A lot of people, including politicians and doctors, want a special group to look into what's going wrong. They also want to fix the problems so that people can get better care when they need it. Most people who live in Wales want this too. Some people worry that the health care system in Wales is getting worse, and they want it to improve so that everyone can be healthy and safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of awakening drains the colors from the surrounding objects , and the less colorful an object is , the harder it is to apply awakening to it . Use of Awakening drains the colors from surrounding objects and the more colorful an object is , the less difficult it is to apply Awakening to it .","output":"Although both sentences convey a similar idea about the relationship between the use of Awakening and the color of surrounding objects, they also have some subtle differences in emphasis and phrasing. Let's compare the two sentences in detail. 1. The use of awakening drains the colors from the surrounding objects, and the less colorful an object is, the harder it is to apply awakening to it. In this sentence, the first part (before the comma) explains that the use of awakening directly causes the colors to be drained from the surrounding objects. The second part of the sentence then introduces a relationship between the color of an object and the difficulty of applying awakening to it. It states that the less colorful an object is, the harder it is to apply awakening, implying that more colorful objects are relatively easier subjects for awakening application. 2. Use of Awakening drains the colors from surrounding objects and the more colorful an object is, the less difficult it is to apply Awakening to it. The first part of this sentence (before the \\"and\\") essentially conveys the same idea as the first part of the previous sentence – that using awakening results in drained colors from nearby objects. The second part of the sentence, however, presents the relationship between the color of an object and the difficulty of applying awakening to it slightly differently. By stating that more colorful objects are less difficult to apply awakening to, the emphasis is placed on the fact that colorful objects are easier to work with, in comparison to the first sentence, which focused on the increased difficulty of working with less colorful objects. To summarize, both sentences establish that using awakening drains colors from surrounding objects and that there is a relationship between an object's color and the ease or difficulty of applying awakening to it. However, the first sentence emphasizes the increased difficulty with less colorful objects, while the second sentence stresses the relative ease of working with more colorful objects.

Article: Bulgaria is famous for its roses and produces about 85 percent of all the rose oil in the world. Rose oil is called liquid gold  and is used in making soaps, chocolates, perfumes   and so on.      The first records about growing roses on Bulgarian land go back many centuries. The Rose Valley developed in the area between the cities of Kazanlak and Karlovo in central Bulgaria.      The roses seem to love the soil and weather there. The rose is the most important plant grown in Bulgaria, which could be called the country on the roses. The rose plantations  in the Rose Valley are the largest in the world.      Much of the population in the Rose Valley works in the rose industry. In Bulgaria, we produce rose oil, rose water and other products. Rose oil is used in high-quality perfumes produced in many countries. The main flower grown is the Kazanlak rose, which is famous around the world.      The oil is prepared by distillation  . Each flower is picked by hand, and you need 3,000 kilos to make one kilo of rose oil. That means about 30 flowers for just one tiny drop oil. So you can understand why it is so expensive and is called liquid gold.      Each year on the first weekend in June, during the harvest, there is a Festival of Rose in Kazanlak with many performances. Judges choose the Queen of Roses as part of the summer festival. After this, she honors the most skillful picker of roses in the harvest.      This festival is an old tradition and goes back more than a century. Today it also includes an International Folklore Festival and attracts many tourists. The festival ends with a concert in the evening. There are also festivals in Karlovo and other towns.

Question: What type of situation is taking place at the grocery store? Movie title: Cobra Movie plot: An armed gunman causes a hostage situation at a Los Angeles grocery store. When negotiations between him and the law fail, Marion Cobretti (codenamed \\"Cobra\\") (Sylvester Stallone), a member of an elite division of the Los Angeles Police Department known as the \\"Zombie Squad\\", is summoned to the scene. Cobretti infiltrates the store, locates, and negotiates with him. During the negotiation, the criminal speaks of the unknown \\"New Order\\", a group of social darwinist radicals that despise modern society and believe in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule the world. Cobretti then kills the gunman by throwing a knife at his abdomen and firing shots at him. As the bodies are removed from the supermarket, Cobretti is admonished by Detective Monte (Andrew Robinson) for his seeming disregard for police procedures and protocols. Harassed by reporters, Cobretti admonishes them for failing to put the safety of potential victims first. Little does everyone realize at the time is that the supermarket hostage crisis is only one of a string of recent and seemingly unconnected acts of violence and murder that have broken loose in Los Angeles, perpetrated by the same supremacist group the supermarket gunman mentioned. After witnessing several individuals going on a spree killing, including the New Order leader, only identified as 'The Night Slasher' (Brian Thompson), model and businesswoman Ingrid Knudsen (Brigitte Nielsen) becomes the group's main target due to her being the only living witness to their crimes. After a failed attempt on her by the group, she is placed under the protective custody of Cobretti and his partner, Sergeant Tony Gonzales (Reni Santoni). Several more attempts are made on their lives by various people connected to the Order. Cobretti theorizes that there is an entire army of killers operating with the same modus operandi rather than a lone serial killer with some associates, but his suggestion is rebuffed by his superiors.

It truly has been my go-to in the past and I am super sad that I am going to stop frequenting this business.   I am not exactly sure what has changed but my last few visits have been anything but pleasant. First, a couple weeks ago I came in for my normal eyebrow wax. Usually I am in and out in a couple minutes with perfectly manicured brows. This time I left with my eyebrows on FIRE. I went to the Albertson's following my appointment and bought some cooling aloe gel for relief but nothing helped. The area ended up breaking out in blisters that last at least a week. I had several people ask me if I had suffered a burn. Yikes! it was not good and extremely painful.   I let the bad eyebrow wax slide and thought maybe it was a fluke accident and went back last night for a mani-pedi. I feel bad because I am not sure the tech who was working on me really understood some of the things I was trying to communicate to her.

I can’t f–kin’ believe I’m gonna be f–kin’ 80.“ So says Larry King, who on a recent Thursday afternoon was sitting under the lights of Keith Olbermann’s ESPN studio in Times Square. “When I was a kid, no one was 80. People died when they were 67.” King doesn’t look 80—or 79, for that matter, since the pivotal birthday arrives on Nov. 19—so much as he looks like Larry King. For 30 years, Larry King has looked like Larry King: aquiline, suspendered (Turnbull and Asser, the same outfit that dresses the English royals), more head than torso. He’s got a mug on the desk, and iced coffee in that mug. Olbermann was out in Atlanta on assignment, hosting TBS’s studio coverage for the MLB playoffs, so ESPN executive editor John Walsh, an old pal, tapped King to fill in for three shows. Thursday, for his last show, his guests are Athletics manager Bob Melvin and Lions running back Reggie Bush, both appearing via satellite, and the co-hosts of ESPN’s First Take, Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith, both in studio. “I’d love to do it again. It’s been a hoot,” King says. When Olbermann hosts, the show airs live at 11 p.m. King’s version instead tapes piecemeal between 3 and 5 p.m. He first tapes the bumpers, the brief segments on either side of a commercial break, then the Melvin remote. After that, he pops on a brown Borsalino and gets to talking about gambling, for his opening monologue. “Last year I had a great run picking games on my Twitter account. I got 2,600,000 followers. I hit 80 percent — with the points!” He tells some wild stories about the 1970s Dolphins, and a pal of his who lost 20 grand on an NFL bad beat. From quick glances at his teleprompter, I can tell that all the color in King’s monologue comes straight from his head. (“I’m flying on a plane with Don Shula…”) Only the skeleton of the story is laid out before him. He finishes the bit with a flourish, tossing a newspaper behind him. (PHOTOS: Broadcast Giant Larry King) “Cal: that work?” King’s asking one of the men in his retinue, Esquire’s Cal Fussman. Fussman wrote two books with King, and brought him the hat today. (An early present for King’s 80th.) Fussman points back with both hands. “Larry’s like John Coltrane. No broadcaster can improvise like he can.” Next comes the Reggie Bush interview. The satellite feed keeps freezing, sticking temporarily on a delayed image of Bush. (Because it’s a Thursday night, the busted video poses a special problem: NFL rules prohibit the use of game highlights while a game plays on another channel.) But King thinks it went well, he tells his producer. He was especially happy with the question he asked about being a running back—”What’s it like, for you, when you see that opening? When you know, there it is?” — even though it elicited a giggle from its subject. To King, it’s a signature question, something no one else would ever ask on television. “We coulda done Bush longer,” King says. “Well, there was the visual problem,” his producer replies. “There was one little glitch.” “No, there were a lot.” “I didn’t notice a lot,” King replies. “I did. It’s not your fault. It’s our fault.” “Why didn’t I see that here?” “I don’t know. You should have. It’s bad.” The producer departs. “God, I said I thought it happened once.” King moves on. He’s got a bunch of typed notecards laid out before him for the Bayless and Smith interview, the last thing he’ll tape for ESPN. The cards are his “blanket.” He plans to freewheel otherwise. He and Smith are friendly; he knows Bayless’s newspaper work well; and he watches their show often. “I love it. They’re a married couple gone astray,” he says. Smith bounds in from makeup, and King greets him with all kinds of hype. “There he is! The dapper Dan! The suave one! My man!” “Larry! How ya doin, buddy? Long time no speak.” “Are you still writing? I think Kornheiser writes once a week for the Post. Does Wilbon still write?” Soon they get to comparing watches. King’s is modest, with a leather band. Smith’s is gaudy as can be. King wants a closer look. “It’s just a Bulova. That’s all it is, Larry.” “A Bulova? Come on. That’s a Rolex.” “No, trust me, when I’m trying to tell you. I don’t make your money, man.” “Bulova? Please. That thing is signaling ships.” But Bayless is taking a while with his makeup, running behind Smith, and King is getting impatient. “Can we get started, guys? I’ve gotta run do an interview from here. I’m doing Brian Williams’ daughter today.” King still does a half-hour interview show on Ora.TV, a venture he started with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. “I’ve never seen Girls. But I hear it’s good!” “Where is Skip? Hey, Cal, do you see Skip? I got a time problem here. Is he comin’?” Smith: “My sisters take a shorter time. Good lord.” Finally Bayless turns up. “Bayless! Thanks for humbling us with your appearance.” They quickly get to taping. It’s a relaxed discussion, detached from the shtick that characterizes First Take. They explain their partnership, how Bayless stood up for Smith when ESPN had soured on him. In Larry King’s presence, they almost turn genuine. When Skip, Stephen A., and Larry have exhausted much of their time together, he wants to ask about something else. King: “Don’t you miss newsprint, though? Real paper?” Smith: “Of course you miss it, but… in two seconds, you can find out what’s going on 3,000 miles away. The newspaper, the print, they’re printing the night before. You’ve got it on your doorstep, but you don’t have the up-to-date news that happened an hour ago or even five minutes ago.” King: “But they’ve got background.” Smith: “And you can use them for background. But you can go online and get background, too.” King, an early pioneer of national talk radio and cable television who makes his living broadcasting online these days and has nearly as many Twitter followers as Jamaica has islanders, isn’t ready to leave print behind. “I miss USA Today. Boy, I had such fun with that once a week. 20 years I did that column.” “It’s sad, isn’t it?” he asks Bayless and Smith. The two scribes-turned-TV-pundits are not so elegiac. King wraps up the segment with a few questions for the pair about surprises in the NFL, and their World Series predictions. Then it’s over, and the three leave the stage. While Smith and Bayless chat with assembled guests, Larry King says his goodbyes and slips off. He’s in a hurry.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"what sense  do the eyes have\\"  Context: \\"The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The eyes possess the sense of vision.

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.  Question: \\"Whose missionary efforts resulted in the spread of Catholicism in Macau?\\" Answer: \\"The Jesuits\\" Is this answer correct? Available options: A. no B. yes...I think the answer is","output":"B. yes The text states, \\"As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries.\\" This indicates that it was the Jesuit missionaries who were actively promoting and spreading Catholicism in Macau.

Ahmed Merabet is reportedly a Muslim whose parents came from North Africa. The Charlie Hebdo attackers shot him in the head as he lay wounded in the street. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Tragic Loss of Ahmed Merabet: A Heroic Muslim Policeman during the Charlie Hebdo Attack On January 7, 2015, the world was shaken as two masked gunmen targeted the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, France. In a horrific act of violence, the attackers killed a total of twelve people and injured eleven others. Among the victims was Ahmed Merabet, a 42-year-old Muslim police officer who has since become a symbol of bravery, tolerance, and unity in the face of terror. His tragic death exemplifies the complexity of religion and identity within acts of terrorism, as well as the broader issues of belonging and loyalty. Ahmed Merabet was a dedicated police officer, serving at the 11th arrondissement police station for eight years. He proudly wore his uniform, applying his knowledge and skills to safeguard the citizens of Paris. To his friends and family, Merabet embodied a loving, open-minded individual who sought to bridge the gap between different communities. Born in Livry-Gargan in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, Merabet's parents hailed from North Africa, symbolizing the rich tapestry of cultures woven together in France. As a practicing Muslim, he reconciled his religious beliefs with his commitment to law enforcement, dispelling the stereotype often perpetuated that Islam is incompatible with Western values. To many, Merabet served as a poignant reminder that terrorism does not define an entire faith, community, or ethnicity. The gruesome video of Merabet's death circulated online, further fueling shock and outrage as the attackers callously executed him while he lay wounded on the pavement. The cold-blooded and heartless nature of his killing stands as a stark reminder of the brutality and savagery shown during the Charlie Hebdo attack.  Despite the senseless violence employed by those claiming to act in the name of their religion, Merabet's memory lives on as a testament to the core values of unity, brotherhood, and humanity that are at the heart of Islam. It is crucial to not let the actions of extremists dictate the narrative or overshadow the strength and resilience demonstrated by individuals like Merabet. Unity was explicitly displayed when, in the aftermath of the attack and Merabet's death, the hashtag #JeSuisAhmed (“I Am Ahmed”) trended on social media, alongside #JeSuisCharlie (“I Am Charlie”). The global population—including fellow Muslims—stood in solidarity with the families and communities of the victims, collectively denouncing extremism and violence under the banner of a shared humanity. Ahmed Merabet's sacrifice carries a powerful message—that we must guard against allowing the actions of a few to vilify or isolate entire communities. His life serves as a reminder that within every faith and culture, there are those who strive for a world based on tolerance, understanding, and love. As we look to honor Merabet's memory, let us recognize the importance of fostering cross-cultural dialogue and inclusivity, shunning any attempts to sow division or animosity. Ahmed Merabet's legacy is an eternal symbol of humanity's shared values, transcending the barriers of religion, ethnicity, and nationality. His spirit of harmony serves as both a challenge and a call to action, urging us to confront hate and intolerance with acts of kindness, compassion, and unity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix.

Summarize this article: Diana Nyad's 110-mile swim from Cuba to Florida has generated positive publicity and adoration for the 64-year-old endurance athlete _ along with skepticism from some members of the small community of marathon swimmers who are questioning whether she accomplished the feat honestly.

(Associated Press)      On social media and the online Marathon Swimmers Forum, long-distance swimmers have been debating whether Nyad got a boost from the boat that was accompanying her _ either by getting in it or holding onto it _ during a particularly speedy stretch of her swim. They also question whether she violated the traditions of her sport _ many follow strict guidelines known as the English Channel rules _ by using a specialized mask and body suit to protect herself from jellyfish.      \\"When you know how hard it is, you kind of want those details,\\" said Andrew Malinak, a Seattle long-distance swimmer who crunched the data available from the GPS positions tracked on Nyad's website and concluded that he didn't trust what he saw.      Nyad's navigator and one of the swim's official observers told The Associated Press this weekend that Nyad didn't cheat and that she was aided during the rapid part of her swim by a swift current. And neither Nyad nor her team ever said she would follow English Channel rules, developed for swimming the waters between England and France. Those rules outlaw neoprene wetsuits and contact with a support boat. Nyad wore a full non-neoprene bodysuit, gloves, booties and a silicone mask at night, when jellyfish are a particular problem, and removed the suit once she got over the reef on her approach to Key West.      According to Nyad's team, she finished the swim Monday afternoon after roughly 53 hours in the water, becoming the first to do so without a shark cage. It was her fifth try, an endeavor apparently free from the boat troubles, bad weather, illnesses and jellyfish encounters that have bedeviled Nyad and other swimmers in recent years.      Nyad's progress was tracked online via GPS by her team, and some critics say they think information is missing.      Many wonder about a roughly seven-hour stretch when Nyad apparently didn't stop to eat or drink, recalling her 2012 attempt when she got onto the boat for hours during rough weather. Nyad eventually got back into the water to try finishing, but her team was criticized for delaying the release of that information to the public.      Malinak said the hours-long spike in Nyad's speed after 27 hours of swimming is particularly questionable _ she went from her normal pace of roughly 1.5 mph to more than 3 mph, then slowed down again as she approached Key West.      Nyad's spokeswomen did not immediately return telephone calls this weekend, but her navigator and Janet Hinkle, one of the official observers for the swim, told the AP that Nyad didn't cheat.      Navigator John Bartlett said the increased speed was due to the fast-moving Gulf Stream working in her favor, nothing more.      \\"At some points we were doing almost 4 miles an hour,\\" Bartlett said. \\"That's just the way it works. If the current is in your favor at all, that explains it.\\"      The data collected by Bartlett and two observers will be submitted to three open-water swimming associations and the Guinness World Records for verification, Bartlett said.      An oceanographer not affiliated with Nyad's team said the swimmer couldn't have picked a more perfect current to get from Havana to Key West.      Mitch Roffer of Melbourne-based Roffer's Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service Inc. said he got an email questioning whether Nyad's swim was a hoax, so he decided to look at the charts for himself. What he saw convinced him that she could do it.      \\"Many times that current runs west-east and you're constantly fighting the current if you're swimming north. In this case, it was in the shape of an S, and the angle was almost exactly from Havana to Key West,\\" Roffer said.      Janet Hinkle, a Key West boat captain and acquaintance of Nyad's, was called to be an observer for the swim when Steve Munatones, a former U.S. national open-water coach, was unable to make it. \\"I can say unequivocally she swam every stroke without question,\\" Hinkle said.      Critics have said Hinkle was too close to Nyad to be an independent observer of her swim. Hinkle has in the past helped Nyad by providing housing for her when the swimmer stayed in the Florida Keys, but she said she remained on the periphery of Nyad's team. \\"I think anyone who knows me knows me as a person of high integrity. I believe that's why Diana asked me, and I took my job very seriously,\\" Hinkle said. \\"She was giving her all and I would give her my best.\\"      Since none of the various open-water swimming associations dictate how someone should swim from Cuba to Florida _ officially accomplished only by Nyad and Susie Maroney, who used a shark cage _ Nyad just had to follow generally accepted rules about not getting out of the water or using equipment such as fins.      Australian Chloe McCardel followed English Channel rules in her attempt to swim the Florida Straits in June. She had to be pulled from the water after 11 hours after being stung jellyfish.      \\"Generally the rules are: You walk in, you swim across and you walk out, and you do it under your own power,\\" said Munatones, who consulted with Nyad for this swim and observed her attempts in 2011 and 2012.      The elaborate, full-body suit and protective mask Nyad wore to protect herself from venomous jellyfish actually weighed her down, Munatones said.      \\"To put that on is like putting on a wedding gown in the ocean,\\" he said. \\"It's different from the English Channel rules, but the water is different from the English Channel.\\"      To many, it seems Nyad hasn't exactly endeared herself to those in the marathon swimming community. Some consider her primarily concerned with gaining the spotlight instead of helping others advance the sport.      At her post-swim news conference on Tuesday, Nyad admitted that she had not been rooting for McCardel and that she was miffed some members of her team would jump ship to work for a competitor.      McCardel said she was disappointed to hear Nyad call those crew members \\"traitors.\\"      \\"One of the greatest things, I believe, about international marathon swimming is how people across the world support crew for and mentor each other. I wouldn't change this aspect of our sport for the world!\\" McCardel posted on her Facebook page.      ___      Follow Jennifer Kay on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/jnkay. ||||| “They want to know how the facts came down so they can understand it. They have every right to ask all these questions, and we have every intention to honor the accurate information.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Her swim was not documented by independent news media, as were her previous attempts. Nyad acknowledged that the news media had wearied of the story because she had failed so often. Nor did members of Nyad’s crew take continuous video of the swim, a strange decision to some marathoners.      “If I was doing a swim that had never been done before and everyone thought impossible, I’d have a video camera on me continuously,” said Evan Morrison, the San Francisco founder of Marathonswimmers.org, an online community of more than 700 athletes.      But Steven Munatones, a former marathon swimmer and swimming official who has served on Nyad’s earlier crews, said he had no doubts.      “I am 100 percent satisfied based on the GPS data, marine information, written information and personal interviews that she did the swim,” said Munatones, of Huntington Beach, Calif.      Munatones said he intended to review all the data from Nyad’s crew with a panel of other swimming experts, including the president of the Catalina Channel Swimming Federation, so they could answer all the questions being raised. The federation president, Forrest Nelson, said he had agreed.      Munatones’s involvement has added to the pique voiced by some marathon swimmers — a notoriously independent lot who cross waterways of 10 miles or more. Several have asked how Munatones and Nyad’s official observers could be impartial, because they all knew Nyad before the swim and Munatones had served on her previous crews. (Munatones says he considers observers part of any swimmer’s crew, a contention that many would fault.)      Marathoner online forums have buzzed with speculation as to whether Nyad got a power boost by climbing aboard her boat. (She says no.) They have posited that by helping her don a protective silicone mask for jellyfish and a special suit to ward off stings, her crew helped her in ways that other channel associations would prohibit. (Nyad says the crew never buoyed her, and thus the swim was “unassisted.”)      The biggest source of grousing pertains to Nyad’s speed and distance covered and the amount of push she got from the currents. Her previous attempts were undone by bad weather and uncooperative currents, which tend to sweep eastward toward the Bahamas. Nyad is a plodder; she says she averages less than 2 miles per hour. She swam at 1.7 m.p.h. when she left Cuba on Aug. 31 and again when she neared Key West.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      One marathon swimmer, Andrew Malinak of Seattle, used Firebug, a Web development tool that inspects code, to glean Nyad’s GPS data from the swimmer’s official Web site. He surmised that Nyad was traveling at an increasingly speedy clip on the swim’s second day — from 2 m.p.h. to more than 6 m.p.h. around 31 hours into the swim. After her crew made the data available with time stamps, Malinak revised his work and said that Nyad’s top speed was nearly 4.5 m.p.h. for a stretch. The pace was inconsistent, he said, with surges and then valleys, plunging her times to 2 m.p.h.      “The rapid increase and two subsequent rapid decreases in her speed, combined with the already fast pace, still leave me skeptical of her swim’s authenticity,” said Malinak, a geotechnical engineer in Seattle, who has swum around Manhattan.      Photo      Fellow swimmers have asked if it is possible that Nyad was on a boat when those surges happened.      Nyad and some on board her flotilla said no. Her navigator, John Bartlett, a custom boat builder in the Florida Keys, says the fast water flows were predicted by a Connecticut physical oceanographer. Some of the fastest currents unfolded around noon on the swim’s second day, moving at 3.8 knots, close to 4 m.p.h.      “They’re always that fast in the axis, the center of the flow,” said Bartlett, who crewed for Nyad on earlier attempts.      “I didn’t record our speed per se at given moments,” Bartlett said about his written logs. “I was doing an average speed — calculated from the beginning.”      Bartlett said that currents varied, and that the team had worked Nyad sideways and northward through the currents, a technique called crabbing. “Everyone is saying, Wow, she was going fast; how is that possible?” Bartlett said. “The currents were going fast.”      The currents eased up to 1.4 knots on Day 3, but the direction was more northern, and thus more helpful to Nyad.      “That’s how the speed increased,” Bartlett said. “The direction of the current was better.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Nyad said: “We were definitely traveling north at a faster speed than what I can do on my own. I just got lucky.”      Besides getting fair weather, with just a short squall to slow her, Nyad also benefited from great currents, which she hit at the ideal time, said Mitchell Roffer, a biological oceanographer and owner of Roffer’s Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service in West Melbourne, Fla. Roffer, who independently checked the currents after the swim when the criticisms mounted, said Nyad was swept along by a moving gyre, a large counterclockwise rotating current that moves from the Gulf of Mexico into the Keys, taking Nyad on a fast ride. It forms less than once a month, he said.      “She hit it at the ideal time,” Roffer said. “Rather than angle and have to fight it, in this case she actually rode with the current.”      Bartlett, her navigator, cautioned the people crunching numbers. GPS data culled by Malinak from what was recorded by spot trackers set on the deck of the escort boat is far less reliable than the information from the professional GPS units Bartlett used. The spot trackers are “designed to be a convenience so the public can watch the progress, but they’re not infallible and not precise,” he said. “If there’s a discrepancy between what I have on paper and the spot trackers, you can just disregard the spot trackers.”      Critics say the observers — typically people who have never met the athlete — are unknown in the swimming community, odd for such a high-profile event. Munatones was supposed to observe the swim.      On earlier outings with Nyad, Munatones said he “did everything including getting sponsors, organizing the crew, blogging, and jumping in the water and helping feed her.” But when the team decided that the conditions were perfect, Munatones was on a plane to Tokyo. Nyad said she had to scramble to find two substitutes, both Key West locals who did not have a history of swimming or observing record crossings.      One, Janet Hinkle, a licensed Key West boat captain, said she got the call at the last minute. She said she had met Nyad in 2011, providing her with a home to live in before a swim. Hinkle had never observed any swim, but she said she got tips from Munatones and said she was unbiased.      “I believe she asked me because I would be an objective observer,” Hinkle said. She said she never observed Nyad getting on board the boat during the swim or being pulled by a craft.      Nyad’s fans have called the critics “haters” who are jealous. Nyad has long been a lightning rod among swimmers who object to the publicity she seeks and the tactics she employs — like letting her crew remove her stinger suit and apply lotions. Many swimmers say those violate the most common rules of the sport, those followed by English Channel swimmers.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “Nyad owes the swim world a look at her data and absolute transparency about how she was able to cross a waterway that has crippled other, younger swimmers,” said Bonnie Schwartz, a New York City resident who crossed the English Channel in 2005. “We’re her peers. She’s not above us.” |||||","output":"Diana Nyad, a 64-year-old athlete, swam 110 miles from Cuba to Florida.

Step 3: Determine whether the perturbation hypothesis is related to the process. In this case, the perturbation hypothesis (less acid rain) does not seem to have a direct connection to the kidney's waste removal process. Acid rain is an environmental phenomenon resulting from air pollution, and its effects are generally more related to ecological systems and structures. Step 4: Evaluate the potential indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the process. Although acid rain is not directly related to the waste removal process in the kidneys, there could be indirect effects. For example, if acid rain affects the quality of drinking water or food sources, it might have consequences for human health, leading to changes in the waste produced by the body. However, this is a speculative connection and would require further research to establish a definitive link.

To be sure you aren't ingesting any dirt or pesticides, always wash produce before you prepare it. If the lettuce is marked “ready-to-eat,” the FDA has certified that it is clean and can be eaten as it is, but some experts recommend washing it again when you get home.  Remove the outer layers of leaves, until you get to a layer where you can't see any visible dirt or wilted edges. Grasp the entire head of lettuce and run it under running water. Gently scrub the exterior of the lettuce with your fingers to remove any traces of dirt or pesticides. Do not soak your lettuce in a sink filled with water – this will not remove the dirt. The stalk of the lettuce tends to be tough and can have a bitter taste. Remove the pale, hard tip of the head and discard it. Also discard any of the outer leaves that appear wilted or discolored. Put the lettuce on a clean chopping board and use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the head in half, through the root (or stalk). A classic chef's knife with an 8 to 10 inch (20 – 25 cm) blade is recommended for chopping lettuce and most other vegetables. Set each half of the lettuce, cut side down, on the cutting board. Slice each half in half, through the root (stalk). Place the lettuce quarter-section on the cutting board with the outer leaves against the board and the cut edges facing up.  Position the knife at the far, right edge of the lettuce and begin cutting with a back and forth sawing motion until you reach the cutting board. Move over approximately 1/4-inch and begin sawing again. The last piece of the head segment may be too small to slice safely. Reposition the small piece on the cutting board so that it lays flat, and finish slicing. Move onto the other half of the lettuce if a lot of shredded lettuce is desired. Slice only what you will need for your meal, and return the remaining uncut portions of lettuce to the refrigerator. Shredded lettuce will brown and wilt more quickly than lettuce that is left intact.

John and Miriam are vampires, although not in any traditional sense; lacking fangs, they use ancient Egyptian pendants to cut open the jugulars of their victims.The center of their strange existence is Miriam. She is an immortal being, able to pass along her supernatural qualities to selected human beings that she chooses to be her lovers.

Houston-based Buckeye Pipe Line says it immediately shut down the line Friday evening when it detected a pressure problem.      The fuel spilled into the St. Marys River in Decatur, a community of about 9,500 people roughly 100 miles northeast of Indianapolis.      Local officials say booms were placed in the river to contain the fuel, which was being vacuumed off the water's surface.      Decatur Mayor Kenneth L. Meyer says the cleanup could take weeks.      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it is monitoring air in neighborhoods and businesses near the river.

[ + - ] Video      DECATUR, Ind. (WANE) - More than 8,000 gallons of jet fuel leaked into the St. Marys River in Decatur after a pipeline burst.      Just after 6 p.m. Friday, a pipeline failure was reported around Monmouth Road near the Riverview Bar in Decatur. The pipeline company, Buckeye Pipe Line Company, confirmed Saturday that the leaked resulted in a spill of around 195 barrels (8,190 gallons) of jet fuel into the St. Marys River.      A safety warning was issued Friday night from the Decatur Police Department, and residents in Decatur were warned to avoid the area and avoid smoking or using open flames near the river.      The pipeline was shut down immediately, and crews from Buckeye's Emergency Response Team were continuing to clean up the area and remediate any environmental impact. On Wednesday, crews were still on the scene working to clear fuel from the river.      Officials are booming the river at W 900 N in Adams County to stop the spread of the leak, and also at the Allen County line. Private contractors were also called in to assist.      The company said it was working with public safety officials as well as state and federal authorities to address the situation quickly and safely.      Adams County EMA Director John August said the Environmental Protection Agency came from Indianapolis to check the air quality. August said residents could smell something but there won't be any danger. Drinking water was not contaminated in Decatur because this won't affect well water, only river water, he added.

Math Problem Solve 1540 = 883*r - 743*r for r.","output":"Okay, let's solve this step by step. We have a math problem: 1540 = 883*r - 743*r. First, let's see what we are dealing with. We have three numbers: 1540, 883, and 743. We also have a letter, \\"r\\", which is something we need to find. To solve this, we can begin by looking at the two parts that have \\"r\\" in them: 883*r and -743*r. What we can do is add the \\"r\\"s together! So, let's think of it like this: If you have 883 apples and you take away 743 apples, how many apples do you have left? That would be 883 - 743, which equals 140 apples. Now, we have 140 apples (or in this case, 140*r) as a result. So, our new equation looks like this: 1540 = 140*r. Now, to find what \\"r\\" is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 140. So, we need to find out how many times 140 can fit into 1540. Let's do some division: 1540 ÷ 140 = 11. So now we know that \\"r\\" is 11! Final answer: r = 11."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The first part says \\"Girl wearing black headscarf walks in desert.\\" That means the girl has a black headscarf on her head, and she's walking in a place with lots of sand called a desert. Now, the second part says \\"The girl is walking outside.\\" That means she's not inside a building, but outside in the fresh air. To know if the first part is true, you need to check two things: (1) is the girl wearing a black headscarf? and (2) is she walking in the desert? If both of these things are happening, then the first part is true. But if only one or none of them are happening, then the first part isn't true. The second part only tells us that the girl is walking outside, but it doesn't say anything about the black headscarf or the desert.

Answer:","output":"The customer appears to be very dissatisfied with the purchase, based on the content of the review given. From the review, we can derive several reasons why it's evident that the customer is displeased. First, the reviewer uses terms like \\"worthless\\" to describe the book, which clearly suggests strong dissatisfaction. Second, the reviewer points out that half of the book's content is described as \\"empty introduction\\" which the reviewer felt served no useful purpose, particularly for a beginner. This expresses dissatisfaction towards the organization and content of the book, and disappointment due to the failure to meet the expected utility. Further, the reviewer deems the examples provided by the author as unusable, denoting that the book did not provide the practical, hands-on learning experience they were hoping for. This demonstrates dissatisfaction with the book's ability to fulfill its educational purpose. Also, the reviewer indicates that the book is not suitable for experts either, implying that the content doesn't appear advanced or challenging enough for those with a high level of knowledge in the field.  Lastly, the reviewer also mentions about the presence of bug full source from the book's associated website, causing additional inconvenience while trying to use supplements provided for the book. The reviewer ends by saying the learning curve is nonexistent since \\"you won't learn anything\\". All these points strongly reflect a level of dissatisfaction with the book.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who has devised and elaborate scheme against Lufton with Pindalest?, using the article: Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The full name of the person who has devised an elaborate scheme against John Lufton with Jake Pindalest is Tate Riling.

Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Where is Bir Tawil located?","output":"Bir Tawil is located between Egypt and Sudan in Northeast Africa. It is a small, uninhabited piece of land that covers an area of approximately 800 square miles, or 2,060 square kilometers. Despite its position on African soil, it is a peculiar case of a territory that is unclaimed by any state. This unique situation is due to a historical dispute over the border delineation between Egypt and Sudan.  Known for its arid desert landscape, Bir Tawil is of little strategic or economic value, even to its neighboring countries, and so it has remained as a terra nullius, unclaimed by any recognized sovereign nation. Bir Tawil's specific location falls just south of the 22nd parallel north, making it geographically distinct from both Egypt's and Sudan's mutually claimed territory of Hala'ib, which lies to the northeast. An interesting fact about this unclaimed territory is that even though neither Egypt nor Sudan exercises any authority or administration over this land, several individuals from various parts of the world have declared their own claims to 'kingship' or 'ownership' of Bir Tawil, mainly for symbolic or artistic reasons, but these assertions, however, are not recognized by the international community. Even though Bir Tawil isn't permanently inhabited or developed due to its harsh desert conditions, it serves as a unique example of disputed taxonomy and political geography in our modern world. Despite being sandwiched between two nations, it remains unrecognized and unclaimed, becoming an exception in terms of global political boundaries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The win ensured that the team's La Liga title hopes, albeit slim, were kept alive as they continue to chase the leaders in the Spanish top-flight. The match began with Real Madrid, knowing full well the importance of this encounter to their title aspirations, starting strong and dominating the initial proceedings. However, Granada, currently battling at the lower end of the La Liga table, displayed great resilience and were determined not to give up without a fight. The home side remained steadfast in their defensive duties, frustrating Real's attackers while launching their own counter-attacks with intent. The breakthrough finally arrived in the 56th minute when the ever-reliable Karim Benzema, Real Madrid's talismanic forward, found the back of the net after a well-placed pass from the impressive Federico Valverde. It seemed at this point that the visitors would take control of the match, but Granada had other plans. Against the run of play, a combination of defensive errors and a tenacious effort from the home side saw Granada striker Jorge Molina pounce on the opportunity to level the score in the 71st minute, setting up a nervy final 20 minutes for both teams. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, sensing the urgency of the situation, brought on crucial reinforcements in the form of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Isco, in an attempt to unlock Granada's stubborn defense. However, it was left to Luka Modric, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner, to deliver the decisive blow. In the 85th minute, he collected a loose ball outside the box and unleashed a powerful, curling shot that left Granada goalkeeper Rui Silva with no chance as it sailed into the top corner. The visiting Real Madrid contingent erupted in joy, fully aware of the importance of Modric's stunning strike. As the full-time whistle blew, Real Madrid walked away with a vital 2-1 victory which kept their fading La Liga title hopes alive. While the odds might still be against them, this result sends a clear message that Los Blancos are not giving up their pursuit of another league trophy without a spirited fight. Meanwhile, Granada will take heart from their spirited and dogged display, knowing that replicating such performances in their remaining matches could well see them avoid the treacherous drop to the second division. In conclusion, the match between Granada and Real Madrid was a thrilling contest that showcased the tenacity, determination, and quality of both teams. Luka Modric's late goal was the highlight of the evening and an apt reflection of Real Madrid's unwavering commitment to their La Liga title ambitions. As the season reaches its climax, the fascinating battle at both ends of the table continues to offer nail-biting finishes and memorable moments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best performances to date. Mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues. However, he does more than that in this stand-up performance, which took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today. In this hour long performance, Mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration, what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion of Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by Jesus, and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia even discusses whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke. Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which at many times gets him trouble with his critics. For example, he does go somewhat far (and he admits it) with a joke regarding Pope John Paul II and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now.  Mencia's main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as Americans. If you enjoy this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, his show on Comedy Central. Now, what is this review like?

SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the earth. On 17 July, a piece of 4 kilometers wide comet enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared. Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a piece of object in space. The dinosaurs couldn't live through the cold climate that followed and they died out. Will we meet the same end? Question: Why can't the northern half of the earth escape for long? Options: A: Because the land is covered with water. B: Because the light and heat form the sun cannot reach the earth. C: Because people there cannot live at the temperature of zero. D: Because wars break out among countries. A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Why can't the northern half of the earth escape for long?\\" is B: Because the light and heat from the sun cannot reach the earth.

This implies that the sun's light and heat cannot reach the Earth, which affects global temperatures and crop growth. As a result, the adverse effects of the comet's impact, including the extreme cold and lack of food, will eventually affect the northern half of the Earth as well.

News article: Fossil by fossil, scientists over the last 40 years have suspected that their models for the more immediate human family tree — the single trunk, straight as a Ponderosa pine, up from Homo habilis to Homo erectus to Homo sapiens — were oversimplified. The day for that serious revision may be at hand.      The discovery of three new fossil specimens, announced Wednesday, is the most compelling evidence yet for multiple lines of evolution in our own genus, Homo, scientists said. The fossils showed that there were at least two contemporary Homo species, in addition to Homo erectus, living in East Africa as early as two million years ago.      Uncovered from sandstone at Koobi Fora, badlands near Lake Turkana in Kenya, the specimens included a well-preserved skull of a late juvenile with a relatively large braincase and a long, flat face, which has been designated KNM-ER 62000 (62000 for short). It bears a striking resemblance to the enigmatic cranium known as 1470, the center of debate over multiple lineages since its discovery in the same area in 1972.      If the 62000 skull showed that 1470 was not a single odd individual, the other two specimens seemed to provide a vital piece of evidence that had been missing. The specimen 1470 had no mandible, or lower jaw. The new finds included an almost complete lower jaw (60000) — considered to be the most complete mandible of an early Homo yet found — and a part of another lower jaw (62000).      The fossils were collected between 2007 and 2009 by a team led by Meave and Louise Leakey, the mother-and-daughter paleoanthropologists of the Koobi Fora Research Project and members of the famous African fossil-hunting family. Dr. Meave Leakey is the wife of Richard Leakey, a son of Louis and Mary Leakey, who produced the early evidence supporting Africa’s central place in early human origins. Mr. Leakey divides his time between Stony Brook University on Long Island, where he is a professor of anthropology, and the Turkana Basin Institute in Kenya.      After looking “long and hard” for fossils to confirm the intriguing features of 1470’s face and show what its teeth and lower jaw were like, Dr. Meave Leakey said this week, “At last we have some answers.”      The real crux of matter, said Susan C. Antón of New York University, a member of the team, is how the discovery shapes the interpretation of 1470’s place in the early world of Homo. “These fossils are anatomically like 1470, and we now have some teeth,” she said. “We are more certain that 1470 was not a one-off, and not everything 1470 is big.”      In their first formal report, Dr. Leakey and her colleagues wrote in the journal Nature, “These three specimens will greatly aid the reassessment of the systematics and early radiation of the genus Homo.”      They, however, chose not to assign the fossils to any existing or new species until more analysis is conducted on contemporary hominids. The 1470 specimen was two million years old; the new face and fragmentary jaw are 1.9 million to 1.95 million years old; the better-preserved lower jaw is younger still, at 1.83 million years old.      Fred Spoor, a member of the discovery team who directed the laboratory analysis, said in a news teleconference that the research showed clearly that “human evolution is not this straight line it was once thought to be.” Instead, East Africa, he said, “was quite a crowded place, with multiple species” with presumably different diets.      Dr. Spoor is a paleoanthropologist at University College London and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. The lab work was supported by the institute. The fieldwork was financed by the National Geographic Society, and the dating of the fossils, mainly by Craig S. Feibel of Rutgers University, was supported by the Leakey Foundation.      Although a few specialists in human origins questioned whether the still sparse evidence was sufficient to back the new conclusions, Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the new discovery, concluded, “This new material certainly substantiates the idea, long gathering ground, that multiple lineages of early Homo are present in the record at Koobi Fora.”      Dr. Tattersall continued, “And it supports the view that the early history of Homo involved vigorous experimentation with the biological and behavioral potential of the new genus, instead of a slow process of refinement in a central lineage.”      Bernard Wood of George Washington University, who has studied the early Homo fossil record, wrote in a companion article in Nature, “In a nutshell, the anatomy of the specimens supports the hypothesis of multiple early Homo species.” ||||| Our family tree may have sprouted some long-lost branches going back nearly 2 million years. A famous paleontology family has found fossils that they think confirm their theory that there are two additional pre-human species besides the one that eventually led to modern humans.      A team led by Meave Leakey, daughter-in-law of famed scientist Louis Leakey, found facial bones from one creature and jawbones from two others in Kenya. That led the researchers to conclude that man's early ancestor had plenty of human-like company from other species.      These would not be Homo erectus, believed to be our direct ancestor. They would be more like very distant cousins, who when you go back even longer in time, shared an ancient common ancestor, one scientist said.      But other experts in human evolution are not convinced by what they say is a leap to large conclusions based on limited evidence. It is the continuation of a long-running squabble in anthropology about the earliest members of our own genus, or class, called Homo _an increasingly messy family history. And much of it stems from a controversial discovery that the Leakeys made 40 years ago.      In their new findings, the Leakey team says that none of their newest fossil discoveries match erectus, so they had to be from another flat-faced relatively large species with big teeth.      The new specimens have \\"a really distinct profile\\" and thus they are \\"something very different,\\" said Meave Leakey, describing the study published online Wednesday in Nature.      What these new bones did match was an old fossil that Meave and her husband Richard helped find in 1972 that was baffling. That skull, called 1470, just did not fit with Homo erectus, the Leakeys contended. They said it was too flat-faced with a non-jutting jaw. They initially said it was well more than 2.5 million years old in a dating mistake that was later seized upon by creationists as evidence against evolution because it indicated how scientists can make dating mistakes. It turned out to be 2 million years old.      For the past 40 years, the scientific question has been whether 1470 was a freak mutation of erectus or something new. For many years, the Leakeys have maintained that the male skull known as 1470 showed that there were more than one species of ancient hominids, but other scientists said it wasn't enough proof.      The Leakeys' new discoveries are more evidence that this earlier \\"enigmatic face\\" was a separate species, said study co-author Fred Spoor of the Max Planck Institute in Germany. The new bones were found between 2007 and 2009 about six miles (10 kilometers) away from the old site near the fossil-rich Lake Turkana region, Leakey said.      So that would make two species _ erectus and the one represented by 1470.      But it's not that simple. The Leakey scientific team contends that other fossils of old hominids _ not those cited in their new study _ don't seem to match either erectus or 1470. They argue that the other fossils seem to have smaller heads and not just because they are female. For that reason, the Leakeys believe there were three living Homo species between 1.8 million and 2 million years ago. They would be Homo erectus, the 1470 species, and a third branch.      \\"Anyway you cut it there are three species,\\" study co-author Susan Anton, an anthropologist at New York University. \\"One of them is named erectus and that ultimately in our opinion is going to lead to us.\\"      Both of the species that Meave Leakey said existed back then went extinct more than a million years ago in evolutionary dead-ends.      \\"Human evolution is clearly not the straight line that it once was,\\" Spoor said.      The three different species could have been living at the same time at the same place, but probably didn't interact much, he said. Still, he said, East Africa nearly 2 million years ago \\"was quite a crowded place.\\"      And making matters somewhat more confusing, the Leakeys and Spoor refused to give names to the two non-erectus species or attach them to some of the other Homo species names that are in scientific literature but still disputed. That's because of confusion about what species belongs where, Anton said.      Two likely possibilities are Homo rudolfensis _which is where 1470 and its kin seem to belong _ and Homo habilis, where the other non-erectus belong, Anton said. The team said the new fossils mean scientists can reclassify those categorized as non-erectus species and confirm the earlier but disputed Leakey claim.      But Tim White, a prominent evolutionary biologist at the University of California Berkeley, is not buying this new species idea, nor is Milford Wolpoff, a longtime professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan. They said the Leakeys are making too big a jump from too little evidence.      White said it's similar to someone looking at the jaw of a female gymnast in the Olympics, the jaw of a male shot-putter, ignoring the faces in the crowd and deciding the shot-putter and gymnast have to be a different species.      Eric Delson, a paleoanthropology professor at Lehman College in New York, said he buys the Leakeys' study, but added: \\"There's no question that it's not definite.\\" He said it won't convince doubters until fossils of both sexes of both non- erectus species are found.      \\"It's a messy time period,\\" Delson said.      ___      Seth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Scientists have discovered three new fossil specimens that provide compelling evidence for multiple lines of evolution in the Homo genus.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity.  I am facing a new situation today: David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which field would have lower potential energy, field C or field D?

Sentence 1: \\"US Special Forces troops are training Colombian soldiers at military bases in the region to protect the pipeline, which transports crude from Colombia's second-biggest oil field.\\" In this sentence, the main points are: 1. US Special Forces troops are providing training to Colombian soldiers. 2. This training is taking place at military bases within the region where the pipeline is located. 3. The purpose of the training is to protect the pipeline. 4. The pipeline transports crude oil from Colombia's second-biggest oil field. Sentence 2: \\"U.S. Special Forces troops are training Colombian soldiers at military bases in the region to protect the pipeline.\\" The main points in this sentence are: 1. US Special Forces troops are providing training to Colombian soldiers. 2. This training is taking place at military bases within the region where the pipeline is located. 3. The purpose of the training is to protect the pipeline. Comparing the two sentences, we can notice three main similarities: 1. In both sentences, the US Special Forces troops are the ones training Colombian soldiers. 2. The location of the training is the same in both cases: military bases within the region. 3. The purpose of the training is to protect the pipeline in both instances. However, there is one significant difference between the two sentences: 1. The first sentence provides additional context about the pipeline, indicating that it is used to transport crude oil from Colombia's second-biggest oil field. This information is not present in the second sentence. Overall, the two sentences have similar meanings in that they both communicate the fact that US Special Forces are training Colombian soldiers to protect a pipeline in the region.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (January 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Hazzard County is having a reunion festival, which includes a Toughman-style contest, and a rattlesnake chili cookoff, along with several other events. Uncle Jesse is the grand marshal of the reunion and at the same time, is facing a lawsuit filed by Mama Josephine Maxx for access across Duke property to the Hazzard swamp where she intends to build a theme park. However, Jesse refused access, not wanting to see the swamp destroyed. However, this has made the rest of the townsfolk angry with him, as the new theme park means new jobs, and revenue for Hazzard County. Driving from Washington, D.C., the Congressman representing Hazzard County in Washington, Cooter Davenport, arrives first and goes back to the Duke farm with Jesse, where Jesse is barbecuing ribs for everyone. Shortly thereafter, a car pulls up. Jesse recognizes it as Bo due to the sound of the motor. Bo has gotten a ride from a friend as he, having returned to the professional racing circuit and has come back for the reunion, has wrecked his car (again, according to Jesse). Bo introduces the girl who brought him home and after she leaves, Cooter says she was so good looking, it hurt and Bo joked with him, saying the girl wasn't bad either. Then Daisy arrives on a motorcycle. Daisy has been at graduate school getting a PhD in ecology after a bitter divorce. Then shortly after Luke, who has become a smokejumper for the forestry service, arrives on a fire truck. Luke stops to kiss one of his fellow firefighters, whom Cooter at first thinks is another guy, and wondering out loud how long Luke has been away from Hazzard.

If the Governor General of Canada is unable to give assent, it can be done by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It is not actually necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons, whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker. If each house of parliament is notified seperately, what regulation applies?","output":"When each house of parliament is notified separately about the granting of assent to a bill by the Governor General of Canada or his deputy, certain regulations apply. Firstly, both houses must be notified on the same day. The method of notification differs between the two houses. For the House of Commons, should it not be in session at the time, notification can be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons. This serves as an official record that the House of Commons has been apprised of the granting of the assent. Meanwhile, for the Senate, it must be in session for the notification to take place. Further, the Governor General's letter has to be read aloud by the speaker in the Senate. This ensures that all the members of the Senate are aware of the granting of the assent. This approach is the alternative to the method in which the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament. Despite the two methods available, if the parliament is not apprised of the granting of assent, the bill will not be considered to have become law.

(nee Haring) and Donald Tyler Rohrabacher. He attended elementary school locally, and during his college years, he lived in Sunset Beach. Rohrabacher graduated from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes Estates, California, attended Los Angeles Harbor College, and earned a bachelor's degree in history at California State University, Long Beach in 1969. He received his master's degree in American Studies at the University of Southern California. Rohrabacher doubts that global warming is caused by humans. During a congressional hearing on climate change on February 8, 2007, Rohrabacher mused that previous warming cycles may have been caused by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by \\"dinosaur flatulence\\": \\"In fact, it is assumed at best to be unproven and at worst a liberal claptrap, trendy, but soon to go out of style in our new Congress.\\" Politico and the New York Times reported that on May 25, 2011, Rohrabacher expressed further skepticism regarding the existence of man-made global warming and suggested that, if global warming is an issue, a possible solution could be clear-cutting rain forests, and replanting. These reports sparked strong criticism by some scientists, including Oliver Phillips, a geography professor at the University of Leeds. They noted the consensus that intact forests act as net absorbers of carbon, reducing global warming. In response, Rohrabacher stated,  Once again those with a global agenda have created a straw man by misrepresenting the position of their critics. I do not believe that CO2 is a cause of global warming, nor have I ever advocated the reduction of CO2 through the clearing of rainforests or cutting down older trees to prevent global warming. But that is how my question to a witness during my subcommittee hearing on May 25th is being reported. I simply asked the witness, Dr. Todd Stern, who is a supporter of a global climate treaty that would dramatically hurt the standard of living for millions of human beings, if he was considering a policy that would address naturally emitted carbon dioxide, which makes up over 90% of emissions. To suggest that I'm advocating such a radical approach instead of simply questioning the policy is a total misrepresentation of my position.  Rohrabacher does not believe that global warming is a problem. At a town hall meeting with the Newport Mesa Tea Party in August 2013, Rohrabacher said \\"global warming is a total fraud\\" and part of a \\"game plan\\" by liberals to \\"create global government\\".

Article:Insolvency experts have predicted that more people who are short of money are going to turn to payday lenders - who can be found on the High Street and the internet - for a short-term loan. Some debt charities and consumer groups have warned that such lenders can lure the unwary into taking on debt that balloons out of control. An official study in 2010 said they provided a legitimate, useful, service that helped to cover a gap in the market. But in early 2013, the Office of Fair Trading said that there was widespread irresponsible lending in the industry. And by the end of the year, the government said there was \\"growing evidence\\" in support of a cap on the cost of a loan, including the fees and interest rates. How do payday loans work? Typically someone will borrow a few hundred pounds from a payday loan firm for a short time, to tide them over until they receive their next wage or salary cheque. The borrower will usually offer a post-dated cheque to the lender to cover the eventual repayment of the money borrowed, plus interest. The cash is often emergency borrowing to pay an urgent unexpected bill, or rent or utility bills. How many people use them? There are no official figures on how many people use this sort of borrowing. But Consumer Focus estimated last year that 1.2 million people took out 4.1 million loans in 2009. In 2008, Â£900m was was taken out in the form of payday loans, according to the Office of Fair Trading in a formal review of all \\"high-cost\\" credit businesses in 2010. But it said the value of the loans was growing rapidly. As a result of its most recent inquiries, which led to an interim report in November 2012, the OFT thinks that as much as Â£1.8bn a year may now be being lent by payday lenders. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said that about two million people in the UK used payday loans. Who uses them? The OFT found that the typical borrower of a payday loan was \\"more likely to be a young male, earning more than Â£1,000 monthly, and in rented accommodation. Many are unmarried with no children\\". But the borrowers are not normally unemployed or without a bank account. They sometimes see the short-term loan as a sensible alternative to running up an unauthorised bank overdraft. Some have turned to these lenders because household budgets are being squeezed and banks have restricted their credit offers. How many firms offer them? The OFT said in November 2012 that there were about 240 payday loan firms altogether in the UK, with the top 50 accounting for most of the lending. Its previous research suggested there were about 2,000 High Street payday loan shops, some of which are part of large national chains, such as The Money Shop. Some were also pawnbrokers as well, operating out of the same premises. There were also thought to be more than 100 online firms offering cash too, which were much more expensive. Across the whole consumer credit industry there are 72,000 lenders, the PAC says, but this includes credit card firms and door-to-door lenders. Are they regulated? Yes. Any lender, whether it be a big High Street bank or a one-outlet payday loan shop needs a consumer credit licence from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). What is the problem? The loans are very expensive with very high rates of interest. But in the eyes of the borrower that is often not relevant. What matters is the cash cost of repaying the loan. That can be acceptable to the borrower if the payday loan is more convenient than an overdraft, or some other sort of arranged loan, and is taken for just a few days. The problem for a borrower starts to build up quickly if he or she cannot in fact repay the loan as planned, and it gets extended, or rolled over. The interest then builds up rapidly and can soon swamp the size of the original loan. Should anything be done? Despite the negative publicity surrounding payday loan firms, the OFT said in 2010 that these and other high-cost credit businesses - such as pawn brokers or home-credit lenders - should not have their interest charges restricted. It concluded that they provided a useful service for some people who would not otherwise be able to borrow legitimately and who might thus be forced to borrow from illegal loan sharks. But it changed its tune in its November 2012 report specifically on payday lenders. It referred the industry to the Competition Commission and has told individual lenders to improve how they deal with customers. However, the PAC was scathing of the OFT's record, accusing it of being \\"timid and ineffective\\" in regulating the sector in a report published in May 2013. The Consumer Finance Association, a trade body representing some payday lenders, says some of the biggest firms have signed up to a code of conduct. However, the government has proposed going further with a cap on payday loan interest rates and charges. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, will make recommendations on how this should work. Previously the government had said such a cap was not needed. More information is available from a series of charities about how to cope with debt problems. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses how insolvency experts predict that more people short of money will turn to payday lenders for short-term loans. Debt charities and consumer groups warn that these lenders can trap individuals in uncontrolled debt. Although a 2010 study deemed payday lenders to provide a legitimate, useful service, the Office of Fair Trading found irresponsible lending to be widespread in the industry by 2013. Payday loans typically involve borrowing a small amount of money for a short time, to be repaid upon receiving the next wage or salary cheque. Approximately 1.2 million people took out 4.1 million payday loans in 2009, a number that continues to increase. Payday borrowers usually have bank accounts and employment, with the average borrower described as a \\"young male, earning more than £1,000 monthly, and in rented accommodation.\\" The UK has around 240 payday loan firms, with 2,000 High Street payday loan shops and over 100 online firms also offering cash. Payday loan firms must have a consumer credit licence from the Office of Fair Trading, and although they have high interest rates, they can be seen as convenient alternatives to other borrowing methods. However, problems for borrowers arise if the loan cannot be repaid as planned, leading to rapidly increasing interest rates. The government has proposed a cap on payday loan interest rates and charges, leaving the Financial Conduct Authority to make recommendations on implementation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System.  - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth .  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, .  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers.  Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.  - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9).  - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.  - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space.  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973.  - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus.   - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence.  - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.  - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva.  - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover.     What object entity has the relation of 'location' with the subject 'biblis tholus'?

Willem Westerhof found 17 vulnerabilities in inverters, which convert electricity produced by the panels so it can be used on the grid. He said internet-connected inverters could be targeted by hackers. One manufacturer said that only \\"a small fraction\\" of its devices were affected. After discovering vulnerabilities in devices produced by a range of manufacturers, Mr Westerhof carried out a field test near Amsterdam on two inverters made by SMA. He told the BBC the test showed it would be possible for an attacker to remotely control the devices and alter the flow of power. Because energy equipment on the grid needs to balance supply with demand, overloading the system could result in a power cut. \\"If an attacker does that on a large scale, that has serious consequences for the power grid stability,\\" said Mr Westerhof. Energy researcher Iain Staffell, at Imperial College London, told the BBC, \\"It's certainly a risk to electricity supply and could stress grid operations.\\" However, he did not believe it could cause blackouts and he pointed out that a large number of inverters would have to be attacked at once for any significant effect to occur. SMA responded by pointing out the limitations to such an attack: \\"The security of our devices has highest priority for SMA in all respects,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"We already assessed the mentioned issues on a technical basis and [are working] intensively on the correction.\\" It added that it would publish further responses to Mr Westerhof's research in the coming days and that it was working on a report about the security of its products with the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre. Asking users to change passwords was a way of pushing liability away from the manufacturer, said cyber-security researcher Tom van de Wiele, at F-Secure. \\"The vulnerabilities are real,\\" he said, though he agreed with SMA that not all inverters would be open to attack. \\"Just because you bought one of their products and a solar array, [it does not mean] that you are vulnerable.\\" He added that he had seen similar security issues in other industrial products. Mr Westerhof discovered the security flaws while working on his undergraduate thesis and detailed the research in a talk at the SHA2017 security conference in the Netherlands on Monday. He said he had decided not to release full details of potential attacks on the inverters, to avoid encouraging malicious hackers. \\"Solar producers should seek to isolate the products from the internet ASAP,\\" said Dave Palmer, director of technology at cyber-security company Darktrace. \\"And [they should] also review their physical access security to reduce the risk of a local attack from someone physically breaking into their facilities.\\" Summary:","output":"A researcher found that hackers could target internet-connected inverters, which are used to convert electricity from solar panels for use on the grid, potentially causing power cuts and stressing grid operations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He served as the head football coach at The College of William & Mary (1969-1971), North Carolina State University (1972-1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977-1983), the University of Minnesota (1984-1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986-1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999-2004), compiling a career record of 249-132-7. Holtz's 1988 Notre Dame team went 12-0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 20 rankings. Context: After two seasons as a commentator for CBS Sports, Holtz came out of retirement in 1999 and returned to the University of South Carolina, where he had been an assistant in the 1960s. The year before Holtz arrived, the Gamecocks went 1-10, and the team subsequently went 0-11 during Holtz's first season. In his second season, South Carolina went 8-4, winning the Outback Bowl over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes. The eight-game improvement from the previous year was the best in the nation in 2000 and the third best single-season turnaround in NCAA history. It also earned National Coach of the Year honors for Holtz from Football News and American Football Coaches Quarterly. In his third season, Holtz's success continued, leading the Gamecocks to a 9-3 record and another Outback Bowl victory over Ohio State. The nine wins for the season were the second highest total in the history of the program. Under Holtz's leadership, the Gamecocks posted their best two-year mark in school history from 2000 to 2001, going 17-7 overall and 10-6 in SEC play.  After consecutive 5-7 campaigns in 2002 and 2003, Holtz finished his South Carolina tenure on a winning note with a 6-5 record in 2004. Holtz's time in Columbia saw the resurrection of Gamecock Football, as the program had only one bowl win and no Top 25 finishes in the ten years before his hire. Upon his exit, USC had posted AP Top 25 finishes in 2000 and 2001 (#19 and No. 13 respectively) and had made consecutive New Year's Day bowls for the first time in its history. Holtz finished his six-year tenure at South Carolina with a 2-4 record versus his former team, Arkansas, beating the Razorbacks in Columbia, SC in 2000 and 2004.  In 2005, the NCAA imposed three years probation and reductions in two scholarships on the program for ten admitted violations under Holtz, five of which were found to be major. The violations involved improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control. No games were forfeited, and no television or postseason ban was imposed. Holtz issued a statement after the sanctions were announced stating, \\"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal.\\" Question: What other note worthy games did he coach with South Carolina? Answer:","output":"Louis Holtz coached many noteworthy games while at South Carolina, but let me tell you about a couple important ones that kids like you would enjoy hearing about! 1. Outback Bowl in 2001: In just his second season at South Carolina, Coach Holtz led the team to the Outback Bowl against a strong Ohio State team. Everyone thought Ohio State would win, but surprise! South Carolina won the game, 24-7. It was a big accomplishment for the team and Coach Holtz. 2. Outback Bowl in 2002: South Carolina had another great season and went to the Outback Bowl again, facing Ohio State for the second time. Like in a movie, history repeated itself and South Carolina won the game again, this time 31-28. It was a close and exciting game, and it made Coach Holtz even more popular. These are just two examples of the memorable games that Coach Holtz coached while at South Carolina. He helped turn the football program around and made it better, making lots of fans happy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Determine the effects of an increased frequency of hurricanes - More storms will likely occur in the area, leading to more wind and water erosion. - Longer-duration storms can cause more significant erosion as they have more time to break off pieces of rock. Step 3: Evaluate the second effect mentioned (deposition of tiny rocks) - With an increase in storms and longer-lasting storms, there is a higher likelihood of wind and water carrying and depositing tiny rocks. Step 4: Analyze the influence of the perturbation on the second effect - Since the frequency of hurricanes and storm duration both increased, the perturbation would likely lead to more deposition of tiny rocks.

They both want to know about the Third Reich and if there was a First and Second one. Let me explain that for you. The Third Reich is a term that refers to a period in Germany's history, when they were under the rule of a very bad leader named Adolf Hitler. This was a very sad time because Hitler and his friends, called Nazis, were very mean and did terrible things to many people. This happened a long time ago, between 1933 and 1945. Now, about the First and the Second Reich. Yes, there were two earlier times in Germany's history called the First and Second Reich. The First Reich, also called \\"Holy Roman Empire,\\" was a big powerful group of lands and people that lasted from a long, long, time ago (800 A.D.) up to 1806. The Second Reich was between 1871 and 1918, when Germany was united under one leader and became a strong country. So, the terms First, Second, and Third Reich are like chapters in Germany's history book.

However, if the exhausted  runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his head was cut off Shades of that spirit spread over today's conversations. Once a friend and I packed up some peanut, butter and sandwiches for an outing. As we walked light-heartedly out the door, picnic basket in hand, a smiling neighbor looked up at the sky and said, \\"Oh boy, bad day for a picnic. The weatherman says it's going to rain.\\" I wanted to strike him in the face with the peanut butter and sandwiches. Not for his stupid weather report, but for his smile. Several months ago I was racing to catch a bus. As I breathlessly put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter, the sales agent said with a broad smile. \\"Oh that bus left five minutes ago.\\" Dreams of head cutting! It's not the news that makes someone angry. It's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered. Everyone must give bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude. A doctor advising a patient that she needs an operation does it in a caring way. A boss informing an employee he didn't get the job takes on a sympathetic tone. Big winners know, when delivering any bad news, they should share the feeling of the receiver. Unfortunately, many people are not aware of this. When you're tired from a long flight, has a hotel clerk cheerfully said that your room isn't ready yet? When you had your heart set on the toast beef, has your waiter merrily told you that he just served the last piece?

Well when the hubbs wanted to come up to watch our Mets take in the Blue Jays at Stade Olympique I made it a point to come here for dinner.  I do have to say Jewish Deli is my #1 favorite type of food. The reason for this has to come from my Grandmothers next door neighbor who IMHO made the best sour dill pickles EVER!!!!  But I digress, but will get to their pickles in a bit.  Let me start off with the place. We get there and it is tiny with maybe 8 tables I could see that were chocked full of people. Also facing the food was a bar that had stools you could sit at. When we got there (9 on a Saturday night) the only two places to sit were at the bar which were fine by us. Now as I have said before I love Deli food so when it comes to the meat I am a little picky.  I do prefer a more fatty cut of meat and they deliver. You have your choice of three levels of fattiness which is a nice option as not everyone enjoys the fatty part of brisket.  The fries are amazing as they are whole potatoes that look like they are cut in house. An order is large enough to split although I tried valiantly to not hog them all but failed miserably.  Ok now the star of the meal for me was the pickles. They were so good that I let the husband have the rest of the fries so that I could have his pickle. Putter is the brand name of them and I really wish that they had them on this side of the border. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be characterized as predominantly positive. This is derived from the reviewer's enthusiastic and detailed feedback about her dining experience.  Starting from her itemized dining experience, she goes on to mention her love for Jewish Deli food, setting up an anticipation for the quality of the smoked meat sandwich she will experience in Montreal. Once she arrives at the restaurant, she vividly describes the ambiance which is filled with diners and a bar. She also appreciates the option to choose levels of fattiness for the meat sandwich, pointing to her preferences and the establishment's flexibility.  Her absolute admiration for the fries and pickles served is also a critical part of her positive experience. Her confession of hogging most of the fries and bartering for her husband's pickle indulges the audience in a playful food experience. While she did not explicitly give a rating or definitive positive adjective, her vivacious narration of the food and atmosphere, alongside her anticipation and satisfaction, unmistakably imply a positive sentiment. However, it's worth noting that the review is also slightly nostalgic and personal, given her mention of her Grandmother's pickles and the special preference for Jewish Deli, which adds warmth and a personal touch to her positive review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Ideally, you want at least 6 players per team for a competitive game. However, if you're playing with a group of friends, keep the same number of players on each side.  You should have 2 rows of players, with the first row closest to the net and the back row closest to the rear boundary of the court. The player in the back right corner will serve the ball. You can rotate players around the court so that you will have a new server for each service game. If you are rotating players out, rotate clockwise -- looking at the net, the player closest to it on the right side would rotate out, allowing for many players to play. Toss a coin or form an agreement to find out who will begin the game. If you serve from in front of the line it will be a point for the other team.  This is known as a foot fault. The ball has to go over the net (but it can touch), and it has to land within the court for the serve to be good.  The player on the right-hand side at the back of the court serves. Each player will only receive one service attempt per serve rotation; you may serve as many times as you can get the ball in the other teams court. The ball is good even if it lands on a line. Thus the rally has begun! A typical play will be bump, set, spike -- but as long as it goes over within three hits, it's good.  Technically, you can hit the ball with any part of your body so long as the ball does not come to a rest. Players may go over the lines, but the ball may not. If a player on your team hits it out of bounds, you may run to retrieve it -- successfully so if it doesn't touch the ground. This could be because of any one of the following:  The ball hits the ground. This can cause the serving team to score 1 point for their team.  If the ball hits the ground on the side of the serving team, then the other team has the opportunity to serve. If the ball hits the ground on the side of the receiving team, then the serving team can serve again. The point is awarded to the team that did not allow the ball to hit the ground.   The ball goes out of bounds. The team that hits the ball out of bounds loses the point. Someone touches the net. If a player on one team touches the net, then the opposing team picks up a point. Someone's foot goes under the net. When this happens, the opposing team receives the point. Someone hits the ball 2 consecutive times. Players can't strike the ball twice in a row, unless a strike is in the block. A block does not count as a touch. A team hits the ball 4 or more times without sending it over. 3 is the maximum. Catching the ball without bumping it on the acceptance from play. Letting the recipient team receive the ball bump from anything besides their arms or hands can cause the serving team to pick up a point. Returning the ball without allowing the ball to cross over the top of the net will score one point for the serving team. The team that won the last point gets to serve the ball. If you're rotating, rotate now.  If your team has the ball, it's common for the rows to back up a bit. The idea here is to get ready for an attack. If you don't have the ball, move forward. The idea instead here is to make the attack. Teams who produce an error or send the ball out-of-play will automatically send the ball over to the other team to serve. No extra score must be added to the \\"new\\" serving team. NO penalty may be given in any situation where the ball touches the net then goes over to the other side to be played. The ball continues to be live and playable (unless it comes back towards the recipient team on the volley). You can decide how many points you will allow for each game. For instance, you can start a new game when a team earns 15 points.  Recent rules state that regulation games go to 25 points, with the third game (in a set of three) going to 15. Sometimes, games may take the form of ending with a certain time limit but this must be agreed upon - generally, this time limit will be eight minutes, but may be longer or shorter dependent on situation for the game. A standard match is three games long. Each team should switch sides at the start of a new game. The loosing team during each service should have the chance to serve in the next game of the match.  A game must be won by two points. 25-26 will not cut it; it must be 25-27. Because of this, close games can go on much longer.

Voting is a civic duty Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"Voting as a civic duty has been a widely debated and discussed concept throughout recent history. The idea of civic duties refers to the responsibilities every citizen has towards their country and its democratic system. Voting, in this context, is often seen as a crucial way for individuals to contribute to and maintain the functioning of a democratic society. The following evidence supports the claim that voting is a civic duty: 1. Upholding democratic principles: In a democratic society, one of the fundamental principles is the right to participate in the decision-making process. Voting is an expression of this right. When citizens exercise their right to vote, they are actively participating in the democratic processes and contributing to the decision-making that affects their lives. By voting, individuals help ensure that these democratic principles are preserved and respected. 2. Representation and accountability: Voting gives citizens the opportunity to express their voice and choose their representatives. Elected officials are accountable to their constituents and are expected to serve the best interests of the people who voted them into office. When citizens participate in the voting process, they help to ensure that their needs and interests are considered by those in power. Moreover, high voter turnout can lead to greater political efficacy and responsiveness from elected officials. 3. Voting as an act of social responsibility: Part of being a responsible member of society is being informed about and involved in the issues that directly or indirectly affect one's life. Voting allows citizens to get informed about current events and policies and, in turn, contribute to their country's overall well-being. Therefore, voting may be seen as an aspect of social responsibility, wherein individuals contribute collectively to the decision-making process based on their knowledge and opinion. 4. Strengthening political institutions: When citizens regularly participate in elections and abide by the rules and regulations surrounding voting, they help build and maintain trust in the political institutions. High voter turnout is considered a sign of a healthy democracy, demonstrating that citizens are engaged and have confidence in the system. Consequently, voting can play a role in maintaining the credibility and legitimacy of a country's political system. 5. Encouraging political engagement and civic education: Voting, as a civic duty, is often accompanied by discussions, debates, and education on various issues, candidates, and policies. This fosters a well-informed and civically conscious population that is more likely to engage actively in the political process. Citizens are encouraged to be critical thinkers, evaluate candidates and political parties, and make informed choices based on their research and judgment. 6. Historical and global context: Throughout history, many groups have fought for and gained the right to vote. This right has not always been accessible to everyone, and exercising it is an acknowledgement of the sacrifices made by those who fought for this right. Voting is also an expression of solidarity and support for democratic processes around the world. In many countries, people are still fighting for the ability to vote, and participating in elections is a way to affirm our shared commitment to democracy across the globe. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that voting is indeed a civic duty, as it upholds democratic principles, promotes representation and accountability, emphasizes social responsibility, strengthens political institutions, fosters political engagement and civic education, and recognizes the historical and global context of the right to vote. By participating in elections, citizens play a vital role in the functioning and maintenance of a democratic society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Where does the Tramp end up in the end? Movie plot title: City Lights Movie plot: The officials of a city unveil a new statue, only to find The Tramp sleeping on it. They shoo him away and he wanders the streets, destitute and homeless, and is soon tormented by two newsboys. He happens upon a beautiful Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill), not realizing at first that she is blind, and buys a flower. Just when she is about to give him his change, a man gets into a nearby luxury car and is driven away, making her think that the Tramp has departed. The Tramp tiptoes away. That evening, the Tramp runs into a drunken Millionaire (Harry Myers) who is attempting suicide on the waterfront. (It is later mentioned that his wife has sent for her bags.) The Tramp eventually convinces The Millionaire he should live. He takes the Tramp back to his mansion and gives him a change of clothes. They go out for a night on the town, where the Tramp inadvertently causes much havoc. Early the next morning, they return to the mansion and encounter the Flower Girl en route to her vending spot. The Tramp asks The Millionaire for some money, which he uses to buy all the girl's flowers and then drives her home in the Millionaire's Rolls-Royce.After he leaves, the Flower Girl tells her Grandmother (Florence Lee) about her wealthy acquaintance. When the Tramp returns to the mansion, the Millionaire has sobered and does not remember him, so has the butler order him out. Later that day, the Millionaire meets the Tramp again while intoxicated, and invites him home for a lavish party. The next morning, having sobered again and planning to leave for a cruise, the Millionaire again has the Tramp tossed out.Returning to the Flower Girl's apartment, the Tramp spies her being attended by a doctor. Deciding to take a job to earn money for her, he becomes a street sweeper.

Answer:","output":"In the end of City Lights, the Tramp manages to acquire the necessary funds to pay for the Flower Girl's eye surgery. The surgery is successful, and she regains her sight. Some time later, the Tramp is released from prison after serving a term for theft, as he had stolen money from the Millionaire to help the Flower Girl. Homeless, destitute, and looking quite disheveled, the Tramp wanders the streets again. The Flower Girl, now with her vision restored and running her own flower shop, does not recognize the Tramp, as she had never seen him before. However, she has always been grateful to her mysterious benefactor for paying for her surgery, and she hopes to someday meet and thank him. As fate would have it, the Tramp stumbles upon the Flower Girl's shop, and she kindly offers him a flower and some money out of pity for his appearance. As the Tramp accepts the flower and the money, the Flower Girl begins to recognize his mannerisms and touches his hand, realizing that this man is her benefactor. The Tramp, initially surprised and nervous about how the Flower Girl would react upon knowing the truth, is taken aback by her warm and grateful response.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.  Paragraph :  The more an elastic object is stretched or compressed, the greater its elastic potential energy is.  Question:   What will happen to the amount of elastic potential energy in Jim's rubber band if he expands it more potential energy or less potential energy? A:","output":"If Jim expands the rubber band more, the amount of elastic potential energy within the rubber band will increase. This is due to the fact that as the rubber band is stretched further, the elastic object (in this case, the rubber band) undergoes a greater amount of deformation. This increased deformation leads to an increase in the amount of stored energy within the rubber band's molecular structure. The elastic potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its deformation, according to Hooke's Law. Hooke's Law states that the force needed to extend or compress a spring by a certain distance is proportional to that distance, and is represented by the formula F = kx, where F is the force, k is the spring constant (a measure of the object's elasticity), and x is the displacement or change in dimension of the object. As a result, when Jim stretches the rubber band more, this increases the displacement (x) in the formula, which in turn increases the force (F) required to maintain the rubber band's new shape. Since elastic potential energy (E) is given by the formula E = (1/2)kx^2, increasing the displacement (x) will cause an increase in the elastic potential energy stored within the rubber band. Therefore, the answer is that if Jim expands his rubber band more, the rubber band will have more elastic potential energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Cardigan, Aberaeron and New Quay councils have already decided not to pay for CCTV coverage from April. Ceredigion council decided to stop funding the system to save £150,000. It was part of its aim to plug a budget deficit of £9.6m during the next financial year. The local authority then asked the five community councils if they were willing foot the bill from 1 April. Following the decision on Monday night, Aberystwyth town and Ceredigion county councillor, Ceredig Davies, said: \\"It was completely unfair of the county council to expect Aberystwyth town council to pay for CCTV coverage in the town. \\"We decided not to pay for the service because we felt that this was a matter for the local authority and the police to pay for the eight cameras in Aberystwyth.\\" Lampeter town councillors will discuss future provision of the town's six cameras on Thursday. The Mayor, Dorothy Williams, said the council was prepared to pay up to £15,400 for a 12-month contract to continue CCTV coverage in the town. It has contributed £7,500 towards the town's CCTV system during the last financial year. She added: \\"We have started discussions with Trinity St David's University in Lampeter regarding setting up a monitoring system there.\\" Aberystwyth: 8 Lampeter: 6 Cardigan: 4 Aberaeron: 3 New Quay: 2 Source: Dyfed-Powys Police One supervisor and two operators based at Aberystwyth have monitored the 23 town centre surveillance cameras in the county but that will cease on 1 April. \\"We have been told that we would have to pay almost £22,000 if we are on our own so we will have to wait and see what happens at Thursday night's meeting,\\" said Mrs Williams. Last week Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire councils were asked to help fund a review of CCTV services to tackle crime in the Dyfed-Powys area. The force's Police and Crime Commissioner Christopher Salmon said the police and the local authorities would benefit from a \\"more consistent\\" provision of CCTV to tackle crime. He added that the cost of the review would be split between the councils and the force. Officers made 414 arrests with the help of evidence from CCTV footage in Carmarthenshire between April and December 2013 - a 61% increase for the same period the previous year. A Ceredigion council spokesman said that council leader, Ellen ap Gwynn, was in communication with Mr Salmon following earlier discussions on the future delivery of CCTV throughout the region.","output":"The provision of CCTV camera coverage in the town of Lampeter, Wales, is under decision by the town's councillors following Ceredigion council's cessation of funding for the system in an attempt to save £150,000 as part of their aim to alleviate a budget deficit of £9.6 million. Other councils, including Cardigan, Aberaeron, and New Quay, have already decided against independently funding CCTV coverage, taking a stance that such funding should be the responsibility of the local authority and the police. The Ceredigion council had requested five community councils to help finance the CCTV system following the withdrawal of their own funding. However, Ceredig Davies, a town and county councillor for Aberystwyth, criticised the county council's expectation for Aberystwyth to self-fund the CCTV cover for their town, which involves the operation of eight cameras. Discussions are ongoing in Lampeter, with the town council set to discuss funding for its six CCTV cameras. Mayor Dorothy Williams indicated the town council's willingness to contribute a maximum of £15,400 towards a 12-month contract to ensure CCTV coverage continuity. This would mark a financial increase from the previous fiscal year, during which the council input £7,500 towards the local CCTV system. Potential partnerships are also under discussion, including a potential monitoring system set-up with Trinity St David's University in Lampeter. Currently, Aberystwyth's 23 town centre surveillance cameras are monitored by a team of three, although this is set to end on April 1. The cost to continue such a service independently would be a hefty £22,000, prompting hesitant sentiments from Mayor Williams who aims to evaluate the decision in an upcoming Thursday meeting. Last week, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire councils were requested to assist in funding a review of CCTV services tackling crime in the Dyfed-Powys area. This proposition was made by Police and Crime Commissioner Christopher Salmon, who advocates for a \\"more consistent\\" approach to crime prevention via CCTV. Assurances were given that the cost of the evaluation would be distributed between the councils and the police force. This followed the achievement of 414 arrests made with the assistance of CCTV evidence in Carmarthenshire between April and December of 2013 - a 61% increase compared to the same period from the previous year. A spokesperson confirmed that Ellen ap Gwynn, leader of Ceredigion council, is in negotiations with Commissioner Salmon regarding the future of CCTV in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Where was the specific location of the nuclear accident in the USA in 1979????","output":"The specific location of the nuclear accident in 1979 in the USA, widely known as \\"Three Mile Island accident\\", was at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station.  The Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station is situated on Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, in Londonderry Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. This island is located on Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River, which is south of the state's capital, Harrisburg. Opened in 1974 (Unit 1) and 1978 (Unit 2), the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station consisted of two separate nuclear power plants, known as \\"units\\". The actual accident occurred in the second unit (TMI-2). On March 28, 1979, a partial nuclear meltdown took place in the TMI-2 reactor at the nuclear power plant. A combination of equipment malfunctions, design-related issues, and operator errors led to coolant being drained from the reactor core, causing it to overheat and, in turn, caused part of its nuclear fuel to melt. This event marked the most severe nuclear accident in U.S. history. Radiation leak was not substantial outside the plant; however, the event resulted in no immediate deaths or injuries. The long-term effects of the incident on the health of the surrounding population also appear to be minimal, but an increase in cancer and infant mortality rates has been claimed, to some extent, by some reports. Nonetheless, there's no consensus among scientific research whether these increases are directly attributable to the accident or simply random variance. The incident led to sweeping changes in how Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates nuclear power plants, changes in emergency response planning, reactor operator training, and more importantly, it turned nuclear power into a major issue in public debates, influencing and shaping legislation and energy policies, transforming the future of nuclear power in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The French company, best known for its Â£8,000 Birkin bags and Â£300 silk scarves, posted a 13% rise in profits to 1.1bn euros (Â£952m). Chief executive Axel Dumas said Hermes did \\"better than expected\\" last year and was entering 2017 on a \\"solid base\\". However, he said he remained cautious given the \\"uncertain environment\\". The results hint at a wider recovery in the luxury goods market. Last month, its French rival LVMH reported record sales. Hermes said sales of its leather goods and saddlery, which account for half of the group's sales, rose by 14%, aided by the success of the Constance, Halzan, Lindy, Birkin and Kelly bags. Silk and textile sales, which earlier in the year were affected by terror attacks in Europe and slowing sales in China, picked up towards the end of 2016. They ended the year 1% lower. Perfume sales rose by 9%, helped by the launch of new fragrances. However, watch sales slipped 3%, \\"penalised by a still challenging market\\" and a high comparison basis at year-end. Hermes said it would continue with its long-term development strategy. \\"In the medium term, despite growing economic, geopolitical and monetary uncertainties around the world, the group confirms an ambitious target of growth rate for revenue at constant exchange rates,\\" it added. Shares in Hermes slipped 2.45 euros to 426 euros, but have risen more than a third in the past 12 months.

Question: What did Calvinist leadership bring about? Context: Politically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle. Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.

In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s.  The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers.  The number 1293 was also restored to the engine.  In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration.  As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive.  It was purchased by Blount in May 1965, and renumbered 127.  Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change.  The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored.  The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971.  After some repair work, the locomotive was returned...

Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter's mistress. Patsy discovers her new friend's identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea. Meanwhile, Baxter's temper improves under Patsy's influence.

Robert and Nancy get married, forcing Brennan and Dale to live with each other as step brothers. Brennan and Dale dislike each other, blaming the other for interfering with their lifestyles. Brennan plays Dale's drum set and a brawl on the front lawn ensues. They are grounded for a week and they must find jobs within a month or they will be forced out of the house. When Brennan's younger brother Derek, a helicopter leasing agent, comes to visit with his family, he mocks their unsuccessful lives and being spoiled brats, which entices Dale to punch him in the face. Brennan is awed that Dale stood up to Derek, while Derek's wife Alice finds Dale's courage a turn on, beginning a sexual affair between the two.

Stevie Ray Vaughan was born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas. He was an influential American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter.  To provide some context about his musical journey, Stevie Ray Vaughan's passion for music started at an early age, and he eventually formed a band called Triple Threat Revue with vocalist Lou Ann Barton, bassist W.C. Clark, and drummer Fredde Pharoah Walden in 1975. Later, in 1977, the band underwent multiple changes and evolved into Double Trouble, named after the Otis Rush song \\"Double Trouble.\\" With the new band, Vaughan continued to perform around Austin, Texas, and gained widespread recognition as one of the leading musicians in the Texas blues scene. In 1982, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble were discovered by David Bowie and John Hammond, which led to Vaughan playing guitar on Bowie's album \\"Let's Dance\\" and signing a record deal with Epic Records. In 1983, the band's debut album, \\"Texas Flood,\\" was released, earning them both critical acclaim and commercial success. Tragically, Vaughan passed away in a helicopter crash on August 27, 1990, cutting his promising career short. As a result, while the suggested answer provides a glimpse into Vaughan's career, it is not an accurate validation of the question regarding his birth.

Little did we know that we were about to have one of the most amazing dining experiences of our lives! From the moment we stepped inside, everything about [Restaurant Name] screamed quality, comfort, and exceptional service. Our reservation was for 8:00 PM, and we were promptly seated at a cozy, intimate table for two. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with dimmed lighting and soft background music that created the perfect ambiance for our date night. We were greeted by our server, Jane, who was attentive, knowledgeable, and made excellent recommendations throughout the night. She ensured that our water glasses were always full and that our courses were seamlessly served without delays. The menu was diverse, with a wide array of mouth-watering dishes to choose from. We decided to follow Jane's advice and opted for the chef's tasting menu, which was a delightful choice. We started with a heavenly amuse-bouche consisting of a slice of perfectly seared scallop on a bed of creamy cauliflower purée, topped with microgreens. This immediately set the tone for the impeccable food quality we were about to experience. Next, we sampled an appetizer of fresh, succulent oysters that were beautifully presented with a tangy mignonette sauce, followed by a refreshing, zesty watermelon salad that complemented the oysters perfectly. As we moved on to the entrées, we couldn't help but marvel at the expertise and creativity of the chef. Our first entrée was a melt-in-your-mouth sous vide beef tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables, all drizzled with a rich, flavorful demi-glace. The beef was cooked to perfection, with an exquisite, velvety texture that left us craving more. The second entrée, a pan-seared Chilean sea bass served atop a bed of creamy risotto and asparagus, was equally divine. The fish was tender and flaky, with a delicate, buttery flavor that simply melted in our mouths. Finally, our meal concluded with a decadent chocolate lava cake that was accompanied by a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream. The cake was warm, gooey, and bursting with rich, chocolaty goodness, while the ice cream provided a cool, refreshing contrast to the indulgent dessert. In addition to the food, the selection of wines at [Restaurant Name] was impressive, featuring a wide variety of options that catered to different palates and budgets. Our server recommended a medium-bodied pinot noir that paired exquisitely with our meal. Overall, our experience at [Restaurant Name] was truly unforgettable, and it has set the bar exceptionally high for future dining experiences. From the attentive staff and remarkable attention to detail, to the incredible flavors and artful presentation of each dish, we highly recommend [Restaurant Name] to anyone looking for a dining experience that will leave a lasting impression. We will undoubtedly return and can't wait to sample more of the culinary delights that [Restaurant Name] has to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Adam and Jacob were born on November 16, 1992, in Newark, Delaware. They were only about a year and a half old when they starred in \\"Baby's Day Out\\" as Baby Bink. Since identical twins were cast to play the role, the filmmakers were able to work around child labor laws, which limit the number of hours a child can work each day. This allowed the film to progress at a smoother pace without overworking a single child actor. \\"Baby's Day Out\\" tells the story of Baby Bink, a wealthy baby who gets kidnapped by three bumbling criminals (played by Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano, and Brian Haley). Throughout the movie, Baby Bink continuously outsmarts his captors and embarks on a thrilling adventure across Chicago, following the story of his favorite book, \\"Baby's Day Out,\\" while the kidnappers, police, and his family attempt to catch up with him. The film did not receive favorable reviews from critics upon its release but has since become a cult classic, particularly loved by younger audiences who were captivated by the resourceful and cute protagonist, Baby Bink.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In sign of Chinese frustration with North Korea, ‘Daily Show’ clip mocking Kim racks up 2.8 million Chinese views “The Daily Show” is not big in China. But when the popular Chinese Web portal Sina posted an eight-minute segment from the show discussing the latest North Korean provocations, it racked up an astounding 2.8 million views and counting, as well as tens of thousands of comments, many of them praising the show. That appears to make it one of the most-watched “Daily Show” clips ever. It also raises questions about whether China’s flagging support for North Korea might reflect popular sentiment as well as Beijing’s own geopolitical calculus. On “The Daily Show’s” own Web site, the segment received 102,000 views for its first half and 58,000 for the second. That’s normally a respectable audience. In “The Daily Show’s” history, only one video on the show’s official Web site has ever attracted more views: a 2008 segment about Fox News’s coverage of Sarah Palin and gender issues. The clip pokes fun at a photo of Kim Jong Un that we’d noted the week before, an apparently photoshopped propaganda image, and at North Korean military technology. It also mocks North Korea’s over-the-top state media and portrays Kim as an adolescent girl, in a reference to the poster for the 2006 film “Little Miss Sunshine.” The clip is full of other references that might not be obvious to a Chinese viewer: South by Southwest, Windows 95. Others, such as a sense of U.S. national fatigue after the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, would seem to better resonate in the American context than the Chinese. China is not mentioned once. In other words, it’s not the sort of thing you’d expect to go massively viral in China. So what explains the enormous popularity? The “Daily Show” segment, without meaning to, may have hit on growing frustration among Chinese citizens, particularly middle-class urbanites, with their misbehaving ally. Chinese state media, though it has allowed some measured disapproval of Kim’s latest threats, has held back from so roundly mocking the country and its supremely mockable regime. The voraciousness with which Chinese viewers are watching the segment suggests that their appetite for such coverage, for publicly criticizing an ally that has become something of an embarrassment, far exceeds what they’re getting. China is more than just North Korea’s most important ally: Kim’s regime relies economically and politically on Beijing, which provides everything from fuel to international support. But, as the Beijing-based journalist Helen Gao wrote last year, there is a strong feeling of disapproval in China toward its longtime ally, a sense that this “ungrateful” country is taking and taking from Beijing and, in return, only embarrassing a China that is very concerned with how it’s perceived abroad. Chinese President Xi Jinping made some thinly veiled but pointed criticism of North Korea in a speech over the weekend, saying that no single country should be allowed to threaten global stability. Analysts have taken this as a sign that China is showing greater willingness to publicly chastise North Korea and rein in its ally, although they also find no sign that China appears willing to change its overarching strategy of propping up the Kim regime. It’s the decision makers in Beijing who will ultimately decide policy toward North Korea and who, in some ways, are the people outside of Pyongyang with the most ability to influence how the country behaves. Still, even if they are not directly accountable to their billion-plus citizens, popular attitudes do enter into their calculus. And it certainly appears that a certain class of the Chinese public could be even more upset with Kim, and even more willing to move away from North Korea, than even Xi did in his speech. Given how deeply Kim relies on China, he should be worried.

It was seen 2.8 million times by Chinese people and had many comments about how funny it was. This shows that some people in China are not happy with North Korea and are making fun of its leader. Chinese leaders have also been criticizing North Korea lately, but they still support it. However, the people's feelings matter, and the leader of North Korea should be worried that many people in China don't like him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Americans are exhibiting an isolationist streak, with majorities across party lines decidedly opposed to American intervention in North Korea or Syria, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. While the public does not support direct military action in those two countries right now, a broad 70 percent majority favors the use of remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, to carry out bombing attacks against terrorism suspects in foreign countries. Sixty-two percent of the public say the United States has no responsibility to do something about the fighting in Syria between government forces and antigovernment groups, while just one-quarter disagree. Likewise, 56 percent say North Korea is a threat that can be contained for now without military action, just 15 percent say the situation requires immediate American action and 21 percent say the North is not a threat at all. Louis Brown, 50, a poll respondent from Springfield Township, Ohio, said, “We don’t need additional loss of American lives right now.” In the poll, 4 in 10 Americans cited the economy and jobs as the country’s most important problems, while only 1 percent named foreign policy.

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\".

The Welsh Assembly Government said that it was consulting with frontline workers to protect essential public services. Mr Marles explained that as 82% of the fire service's ??70m budget went on staffing costs, any significant reduction in budget would mean reducing the workforce. He said that in the event of cuts amounting to 3% year-on-year, the service would probably be able to manage for the first and second years by being \\"a bit smarter\\" in some of its processes and procedures. \\"But ultimately,\\" he added, \\"if this goes on into the third, fourth, fifth year, it'll be very, very difficult to maintain the number of fire engines and the resource and the community safety activity that we undertake now. \\"If the cuts are 25%, it will be impossible to maintain the service we do today in the third, fourth, year from now.\\" Mr Marles said the difference would not be dramatic in terms of how that would affect the service offered to someone dialling 999. \\"We'll still have fire engines,\\" he said. \\"We're not going to take all our fire engines out of the system. But there might be less fire engines. \\"We might be able to put one station where two exist now to be able to maintain the service to the public, but it may mean that attendance times are increased slightly. \\"But it will mean an increase, and every time we talk about changing fire stations, inevitably the public get quite upset about that and understandably so. \\"They expect the response they get now, which is minutes to house fires for the majority of our area.\\" The Welsh Assembly Government said it had been \\"pushing the UK Government hard\\" to recognise the vital importance of protecting essential front line services ahead of the Comprehensive Spending Review on 20 October. \\"We have made prudent assumptions in starting to prepare next year's draft budget, but it would be inappropriate to speculate on any impact the UK government's review may have on public services in Wales,\\" it said in a statement. The outcome of the review would be profoundly important for Wales, it added. \\"We are continuing to consult closely, openly and seriously with frontline workers and engaging with communities the length and breadth of Wales to ensure we work together to protect essential public services\\" said the statement. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Slower 999 response times might occur within three to four years after the UK spending review next month, according to Andy Marles of the South Wales Fire Service. He said that budget reductions would likely result in workforce reductions, as 82% of the fire service's £70m budget goes towards staffing costs. Although the service could potentially manage minor cuts by improving processes and procedures, more substantial cuts could make it difficult to maintain the current level of fire engines and community safety activities. The Welsh Assembly Government is actively consulting with frontline workers to protect essential public services."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","output":"There's no publicly available data on exactly how much weight Adriana Lima gained during her pregnancies. Weight gain in pregnancy can vary greatly from person to person and is influenced by a number of factors including initial weight, multiple pregnancies (i.e., twins, triplets), and individual health aspects. It's recommended that women of a normal weight range gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy, but individuals often fall both below and above this range.

The Spanish sentence is also structured similarly to the original text, maintaining coherence and readability in the translation. Let's go through the translation step by step to better understand the choices made: 1. \\"Some politicians and people\\" is translated as \\"Algunos políticos y personas\\" – this maintains the subject of the sentence and the idea that not all politicians and people hold this opinion. 2. \\"have wanted\\" is translated as \\"han querido\\" – using the present perfect tense (\\"han\\") and the past participle of \\"querer\\" (\\"querido\\") to convey the idea of an ongoing desire or action in the past. 3. \\"to undermine us\\" is translated as \\"debilitarnos\\" – using the verb \\"debilitar\\" (to weaken, undermine) and the pronoun \\"nos\\" attached to it, indicating the action is being done to \\"us\\". 4. \\"calling us\\" is translated as \\"llamándonos\\" – using the gerund form of \\"llamar\\" (to call) and the pronoun \\"nos\\" attached to it, showing that \\"us\\" are being called something. 5. \\"warlike and violent\\" is translated as \\"belicosos y violentos\\" – using two adjectives that closely match the meaning of \\"warlike\\" (belicoso) and \\"violent\\" (violento) in Spanish.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"The two sentences are not direct paraphrases of each other, as they contain different information about John Rzeznik and Robby Takac's affiliations with their respective foundations. However, they are related in that both sentences discuss these musicians' involvement in charitable organizations. In the first sentence, you mentioned that John Rzeznik is an ambassador for the Save the Music Foundation of VH1, while Robby Takac is the founder of the Music is Art Foundation. This sentence highlights John Rzeznik's role as an ambassador which involves promoting and representing the Save the Music Foundation, an organization focused on restoring music programs in America's public schools. On the other hand, Robby Takac is presented as the founder of the Music is Art Foundation, meaning he established this organization that supports and promotes the importance of music and arts education. The second sentence flips the roles of these two artists, stating that Robby Takac is an ambassador for VH1's Save the Music Foundation and John Rzeznik is the founder of the Music is Art Foundation. This change in their roles is significant because it reshuffles the responsibilities and the level of involvement that John Rzeznik and Robby Takac have in these organizations.

Sentence 1: Iran says ready for fresh round of nuclear talks  Sentence 2: Iran's Khamenei renews support for nuclear talks From 0 to 5 (0=\\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5=\\"means the same thing\\"), how similar are the two sentences?","output":"The two sentences share a significant degree of similarity and contextual overlap. They are both about Iran's stance on nuclear talks. However, they are not identical either.  The first sentence, \\"Iran says ready for fresh round of nuclear talks,\\" indicates a general readiness of Iran as a nation to participate in a new series of discussions about their nuclear program. This suggests an open and possibly proactive approach taken by the Iranian government towards international dialogue about its controversial nuclear enrichment activities. This statement could have been issued by any representative of the Iran government. The second sentence, \\"Iran's Khamenei renews support for nuclear talks,\\" goes more specific into identifying a key figure within the country, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, showing his individual support for such nuclear negotiations. This is important because as per the country's political structure, Khamenei's stances have significant influence over the country's international policies and initiatives. Therefore, while these sentences do not mean \\"the same thing\\" verbatim, they have substantial overlap of significance as they both convey Iran's openness towards nuclear talks. The difference lies in who, specifically, in Iran is expressing the readiness for these discussions.  Hence, on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 signifying that both sentences mean exactly the same thing, and 0 indicating no overlap in meaning, these two sentences could potentially be rated around 3.5 to 4 due to the shared context of Iran's receptiveness to nuclear negotiations but shifting focus from general to specific authoritative figure's stance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Heathrow Airport, which is the busiest airport in the United Kingdom and one of the busiest in the world, is served by the London Underground network. Specifically, it is located on the Piccadilly Line. The Piccadilly Line is one of the 11 lines in the London Underground system, and it is recognized by its dark blue color on the tube maps. The Piccadilly Line connects Heathrow Airport to Central London and other important stations in the city, providing convenient and cost-effective transport for passengers traveling to and from the airport. The line includes three stations within the Heathrow complex: Heathrow Terminal 5, Heathrow Terminal 4, and Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3. Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 station serves both Terminal 2, which is Heathrow's Queen's Terminal, and Terminal 3, which is known for its shopping facilities. Heathrow Terminal 4 station serves Terminal 4, which mainly caters to long-haul and European flights. Finally, Heathrow Terminal 5 station is located in Terminal 5, which is the newest terminal, primarily used by British Airways and its partner airlines. A journey from Heathrow Airport to Central London on the Piccadilly Line takes approximately 45-60 minutes, depending on the destination and the time of day. Travelers can expect trains to run approximately every 3-10 minutes, with more frequent service during peak hours and less frequent service during off-peak hours or late in the evening. In addition to the London Underground, Heathrow Airport is also served by other transport options such as the Heathrow Express, an airport train service that connects the airport to Paddington Station in just 15 minutes, and the Heathrow Connect, which stops at local stations between Heathrow and Paddington. Furthermore, passengers can take advantage of buses, taxis, and private car services to get to and from the airport. It is important to note that, when taking the London Underground to reach Heathrow Airport, passengers should allow for sufficient travel time due to potential delays and to consider factors such as luggage, connection times, and walking distances within the airport terminals. Overall, the Piccadilly Line remains a convenient, affordable, and widely-used means of transport for travelers using Heathrow Airport."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Polyps usually reproduce asexually.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. Question: Why does the author try Naked shampoos?

Review: This is a nice looking lounge, quite comfortable, and the slide-out side table is very convenient. However, the surface of each piece is very rough and can give you a splinter or two while assembling it or lifting the piece to move it. The overall appearance is good, but close up one can see that the wood stain is very inconsistant. For this price, however, I still recommend it. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review can be characterized as mixed, with both positive and negative elements. On one hand, the reviewer appreciates the aesthetics and functionality of the lounge, mentioning its nice appearance, comfort, and the convenience of the slide-out side table. These aspects of the review project a positive tone towards the product. On the other hand, the reviewer also points out several negative aspects. They mention the rough surface which can cause splinters during assembly or when moving the piece, and the inconsistency in the wood stain affecting the lounge's appearance upon closer inspection. These criticisms reflect a negative tone towards certain aspects of the product. However, it is important to note that despite these negative aspects, the reviewer still recommends the product due to its comparatively lower price. This suggests that the reviewer believes that the positive features outweigh the negative ones, or at least that the negatives are tolerable given the product's overall value for money. Therefore, while the review has both positive and negative elements, the overall tone can be considered slightly more positive since the reviewer ultimately recommends the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Based on the options provided, it would not be accurate to simply answer \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" in this case. Rather, the question requires a more in-depth explanation and understanding of the topic of cellular organization. So, do I think that the right answer to the question \\"cells are organized into tissues to what?\\" is \\"allow growth\\", given that cells are organized into tissues become functional units? Here is a detailed response: In multicellular organisms, cells are indeed organized into tissues. This organization offers a higher level of structure and function that could not be accomplished by individual cells alone. Tissues can be defined as groups of cells that work together to perform a specific function. They exhibit a close-knit structure and often engage in cooperative interactions. While growth is an essential aspect of the organization of cells into tissues, it is not the sole purpose. Cells are organized into tissues for several reasons, which can be discussed under the following headings: 1. Structural support: Tissues provide the structural framework necessary for the organism's body. They hold and cement various organs and body parts together—for instance, connective tissue like cartilage, bones, and tendons. These tissues contribute to maintaining the overall shape and integrity of the organism. 2. Facilitating specialized functions: The organization of cells into tissues allows for the performance of specialized functions. For example, muscle tissue is made up of muscle cells that contract and relax, enabling movement. Similarly, neural tissue comprises nerve cells (neurons), allowing for the transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body. 3. Efficient resource allocation and distribution: By organizing cells into tissues, multicellular organisms can effectively allocate, distribute, and share resources, such as nutrients and oxygen. This organization also aids in waste removal and helps maintain the internal environment of the organism. 4. Enhanced communication and coordination: The organization of cells into tissues allows for better communication and coordination between cells. This organization is crucial for the proper functioning of the organism's systems. For instance, the heart muscle cells must contract in sync to support an appropriate blood flow. 5. Growth and development: The organization of cells into tissues does, indeed, contribute to growth, as cells can now replicate and specialize in a coordinated manner to support the development and maturation of multicellular organisms. This process enables an organism to grow and repair damaged tissue as needed. In conclusion, while growth is an important aspect of the organization of cells into tissues, it does not solely define the purpose of this phenomenon. Cells are organized into tissues for diverse reasons, including structural support, specialized functions, enhanced coordination, and efficient resource management."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government, however, brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III. A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the Semitic Hyksos. The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris. They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes. What new capital was founded in 1650, lower Egypt?","output":"In 1650 BC, the Hyksos invaders founded a new capital in Lower Egypt called Avaris. The Hyksos were a Semitic people who took control of much of Lower Egypt during this period, marking the beginning of the foreign ruling dynasty in the region. Avaris served as their administrative and political center, and its strategic location in the eastern Nile Delta allowed them to maintain control and influence trade routes. Eventually, the Hyksos were expelled by the Upper Egyptian forces led by Ahmose I, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the Egyptian capital from Memphis to Thebes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Some people have to use public transport, some dislike it and still some love it. If everyone has a car and drives anywhere they want to go, there will be serious traffic problems on the road. Luckily, trains are a good form of public transport. British people use trains a lot. This is especially so for people who are travelling from London to Paris. Every day about 20 trains leave London. They travel at a very high speed and people feel glad that the trains take only 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Paris. It's much faster to travel by train than by bus or by car. This is because people have to drive cars or buses very carefully and lowly for many reasons, such as speed limits and traffic jams. However, when you are travelling by train, the speed is almost the same and there is no traffic jam for a train. Besides, Londoners think taking a train is one of the safest ways of travelling on the ground. Trains take quite a number of quality tests while they are made. More importantly, they have to take many safety checks before they are used on the rail track. What's more, trains in Britain are comfortable and provide fine services for their users. When you are on a London train, you will find that the train has comfortable tables and seats where people can sit. They also provide food services and power plugs  for personal computers or mobile phone. A:","output":"Which of the following statements about train travel between London and Paris is true? A) Trains between London and Paris rarely operate due to low demand. B) Trains take longer to travel between London and Paris than cars and buses. C) Trains between London and Paris offer comfort, convenience, and a travel time of approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes. D) Train tickets for the London to Paris route are exceptionally expensive due to limited availability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The energy minister rejected claims she had embellished details of her 25-year career in finance. She also said she was \\"disappointed\\" at attempts by opponents to block her from the final ballot. \\"I just want an honourable campaign,\\" she told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Mrs Leadsom is up against Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Michael Gove, with the result on 9 September. One of them will be forced to drop out when the result is announced later, with the remaining two to go forward to a vote of the membership. The winner will become Britain's next prime minister. Mrs Leadsom's team has published a summary of her CV, after it was claimed - including by a former colleague - that her previous jobs were not as she had described them. \\"I have not changed my CV,\\" she told the BBC as MPs voted in their final ballot of the leadership contest. There have been claims of underhand tactics in the Tory leadership contest, after it emerged that Justice Secretary Michael Gove's campaign manager had appealed to Mrs May's supporters to unite in an effort to block Mrs Leadsom's chances of getting on to the final ballot. Nick Boles sent a text message to a number of MPs who support Mrs May, urging them to switch sides and back Mr Gove. He said that although he thought it \\"overwhelmingly likely\\" the home secretary would win the contest, he was \\"seriously frightened about the risk\\" of Mrs Leadsom ending up in the run-off. \\"What if Theresa stumbles? Are we really confident that the membership won't vote for a fresh face who shares their attitudes about much of modern life, like they did with IDS?\\" he wrote, referring to Iain Duncan Smith's election as Conservative leader in 2001. He later issued an apology and said Mr Gove had been unaware of the plot. Mrs May's campaign said MPs who wanted her as prime minister had to vote for her, adding: \\"There can be no space for tactical voting - this contest is simply too important to be playing games about who goes forward to the membership.\\" In her BBC interview, Mrs Leadsom said: \\"I am really not interested in other people's tactics, or whatever. \\"I just want an honourable campaign.\\" She said Mr Boles's text message did not bother her, because it was \\"not honourable\\", adding: \\"One of the things I would hope to do as prime minister is to change that from the top by setting an example.\\" Setting out her vision for the country in a speech earlier, Mrs Leadsom said she wanted to \\"spread prosperity to every corner of our country\\". And she told BBC Radio 4's World at One that on becoming prime minister she would act quickly to \\"take back control of immigration\\". Although other EU nationals would still be able to move to live and work in the UK until the UK leaves the EU, she said only those who were already in the UK at around the time she became PM would have the right to stay after Brexit. The leadership ballot takes place between 09:00 and 16:00 BST, with the results to be announced shortly afterwards. A growing group of Conservative MPs are calling for the contest to be accelerated with a result before 9 September. By John Pienaar, deputy political editor By tonight, there'll be two contenders left. Theresa May's the bookies' favourite. She's been called a \\"bloody difficult woman\\" but also good at her job. That's an insult she can live with, but they'll likely get harsher. Michael Gove's hindered by his new-found notoriety as the best-mannered assassin at Westminster, after backing, then burying, Boris Johnson's dreams. Last night, it emerged Mr Gove's campaign manager had appealed - unsubtly - to Theresa May's supporters to unite in an effort to kill off his fellow EU Leave campaigner Andrea Leadsom's chances. He later apologised. Devoid of top-level political experience, she's already having to overcome doubts about her claim to have been a financial high-flyer. A former colleague at investment firm Invesco Perpetual, Robert Stephens, has said \\"she didn't manage any teams, large or small and certainly did not manage any funds.\\" That was after a friendly MP, Bernard Jenkin, spoke of her history managing \\"hundreds of people and billions of pounds\\". A CV listing the post Financial Institutions Director at Barclays later added the word \\"deputy\\". An innocent error, according to Team Leadsom - and the MP who'd boasted of her high-powered background had merely been \\"bigging her up\\". Maybe so, but the contest will be merciless. The fight for the top job in politics always is. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - who is supporting Mrs Leadsom - warned colleagues against spending \\"the whole time stabbing each other in the back\\". At a hustings on Wednesday night, Mrs Leadsom restated that she would not publish her tax return - unlike Mrs May and Mr Gove - unless she made the final two, saying she did not want to set a \\"precedent\\". But Mrs Leadsom told MPs they could come to see a summary of her tax affairs personally if they wanted to. Despite Mrs May's clear lead in Tuesday's first round vote - she got 165 votes of 329 cast - the home secretary has said she does not want the contest to be a \\"coronation\\". The leadership contest has been sparked by David Cameron's decision to step down as leader and prime minister after the UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. 1984 - 85 Canadian / Chinese Corporate Finance Company: Junior Support 1985 - 87 EF Hutton: Trainee Broker, London Metals Exchange 1997 - 99 - De Putron Fund Management: Managing director 1999 - 2009 - Invesco Perpetual: Senior investment officer and head of corporate governance Summary:","output":"Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom is up against Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Michael Gove to become Britain's next Prime Minister, with one of them forced to drop out when the result gets announced later, leaving the remaining two to go to the final vote."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This year's grind-it-out race, an acrimonious spitball contest between two candidates only slightly more likeable than Walter White, is anything but.  In a lesser-of-two-evils campaign, Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Democratic fundraiser and confidante to former President Bill Clinton, is clinging to a modest but sturdy lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general.  Republicans have pilloried McAuliffe as a sleazy political operator and failed businessman who exploited his Washington connections to help his sputtering car company, GreenTech Automotive. Cuccinelli has been targeted as a far-right social crusader who would curb abortion rights and access to contraception. Democrats on Twitter are fond of calling him #creepyken.  McAuliffe is leading Cuccinelli among likely voters by an eight-point margin, 47% to 39%, according to a Washington Post poll out this week.  McAuliffe is hardly bulletproof: A federal investigation into GreenTech has sullied his reputation, and only two-thirds of Democrats -- his own party -- consider him \\"honest and trustworthy.\\"  But Cuccinelli is on much shakier ground. While Republicans are slightly more fired up about voting for him than Democrats are for McAuliffe, Cuccinelli's favorable ratings are next-to-toxic: More than half of likely voters view him unfavorably.  Enter Robert Sarvis.  As public dismay with the two main candidates calcifies, the baby-faced 37-year old Libertarian candidate from Fairfax has quietly crept northward in the polls, reaching 10% in the Post poll.  That's not nearly enough to win in November -- with just five weeks until Election Day, even Sarvis admits \\"we have to get a lot higher\\" -- but he looks increasingly likely to play the role of spoiler by siphoning conservative votes away from Cuccinelli.  1.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. What does Buhari think about Trump?

We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units.  and the situation: John is a world traveler. Recently, he visited two countries, France and Germany. He noticed that in France they use atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units. In Germany they use torr as a pressure unit. Back in the United States, he noticed psi is used as a pressure unit. He needs to figure out how they correlate with each other.

A spray tan is like a magic mist that makes our skin look like we have been playing in the sun. But we need to know how to look after it, so our skin stays nice and pretty. Here are some easy steps to follow: 1. Let the spray dry: After getting a spray tan, we need to wait for it to dry completely on our skin. Think of it like paint that needs to dry - if you touch it too soon, you might smudge it! 2. No showering or sweaty activities for 8 hours: Just like waiting for paint to dry, we should avoid getting our skin wet by showering or playing games that make us sweat a lot. This will keep our spray tan looking perfect! 3. Take your first shower: After waiting 8 hours, we can take our first shower. This will help wash off any extra spray tan that didn't stick to our skin. 4. Moisturize your skin: Our skin needs to stay soft and smooth. We can do this by using a lotion or cream to keep it moisturized. This also helps our spray tan last longer! 5. Say no to chlorine: We might want to swim in a pool, but the water has something called chlorine that can make our spray tan fade quickly. It's best to avoid pools with chlorine for a few days. 6. Exercise in moderation: Working out is good for us, but if we do too much after getting a spray tan, we might sweat too much. This can also make the spray tan fade. Let's exercise just enough to stay healthy, but not too much! 7. Avoid spa treatments and products: Spa treatments, like fancy lotions and scrubs, can also make our spray tan fade. So, try not to use those while your spray tan is still fresh. 8. Apply self-tanner: If you want to keep your skin looking sun-kissed and pretty, you can use something called a self-tanner. It's like a magic lotion that helps us keep the pretty color longer. So, those are the steps to take care of our skin after using a spray tan! Just follow them, and you'll keep your skin looking lovely and sun-kissed. Remember to always be gentle with your skin, because it is very precious.

His prized possession, his only daughter, Princess Yasmine, is known across the land for her exquisite beauty and intelligence. The Sultan, a doting father, is obsessed with ensuring her safety, installing the highest precautions to prevent her honor from being compromised. One fateful day, the prince of a neighboring kingdom, Prince Hamza arrives in Andalus for a diplomatic visit. He spends his days feasting and attending important meetings to establish an alliance between their nations. While exploring the bustling palace, he happens upon a secret passageway hidden behind a wall tapestry. Intrigued, he ventures into the darkness and follows the dimly lit tunnel, which eventually leads to the Sultan's royal bathing house. Prince Hamza is amazed by the sight that unfolds in front of him: sunlight streaming through an aperture in the ceiling, casting its rays on the clear waters of the bathing pool below. Among the sweet fragrances of scented oils and the gentle splashing of water, he becomes bewitched by the sight of the beautiful Princess Yasmine, completely unaware of her identity and the gravity of the situation. Prince Hamza secretly watches her, captivated by her grace and elegance. Just as he decides to return the way he came, hoping to forget the enchanting experience, he is caught. Upon learning his crime, the Sultan is livid and immediately sentences him to death at the hands of his guards. Princess Yasmine, who has a kind heart and a curious spirit, convinces her father to grant the prisoner one last audience. When the two young royals meet face-to-face, they see an undeniable spark between them, though they dare not mention it out loud. Feeling a sense of responsibility for his plight, Yasmine pleads with her father for mercy. The Sultan, who cares deeply for his daughter, proposes a challenge to Prince Hamza: if he can complete three impossible tasks within one moon cycle, he will be granted his life and allowed to marry Yasmine to solidify their realms' alliance. Emboldened by his newfound love, Prince Hamza sets off on a thrilling quest to complete the tasks: 1. Retrieve an enchanted necklace from the lair of a fire-breathing wyvern. 2. Pluck a golden apple guarded by a formidable sorceress from a magical tree that is surrounded by ferocious beasts. 3. Outsmart a cunning genie in a battle of wits. Each task proves to be incredibly difficult and dangerous, yet Prince Hamza's love for Princess Yasmine gives him the strength to fulfill them. As word of his triumphs reaches the kingdom, the people marvel at the rumors of his bravery and fearlessness. At the end of the moon cycle, Prince Hamza returns to Andalus, and he and Yasmine are united amid the celebration of his feats. The Sultan, proud of their love and Prince Hamza's determination, is confident that the union of the two kingdoms will usher in an era of wealth and prosperity for their people. In the end, what was once a crime punishable by death leads to the blossoming of a love that unites two royal families and ushers in a time of peace, prosperity, and enduring happiness between the realms. The story of the bathing beauty's curse transforms from one of punishment and vanity to a tale of valiance, romance, and eternal love."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

That's why so many companies are researching their color choices. They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue. Joclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry   was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap   every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845. Coca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red.

You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others.

First of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie (nothing less than this available). The film fails in every department be it screenplay, direction, characterization or acting.  1) To start with, the name of the movie is really C class (though the movie itself match up to the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). Here in Aag the figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute (with all automatic guns). Making a Sholay like movie in Mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing. 4) As for Nisha Kothari, somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting. Why is Ram Gopal Verma casting her again and again ? 5) Mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie. 7) Legendry role played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some Gangu Mummy. Ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie. Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent. To summarize, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic. Please don't waste money and time on this movie.

LaRoche Answer:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main character and setting Our main character is Charles, a young man in his late 20s who lives in a moderately sized apartment building in an urban city. He is an aspiring writer, constantly searching for captivating stories to write about. The setting is primarily focused on the apartment building and its laundry room. Step 2: Introduce supporting characters LaRoche, a mysterious character found in the laundry room, will play a significant role in the plot. Additionally, we have Amy, the apartment building's manager, and a group of neighbors who reside in the same building as Charles, including an eccentric elderly woman named Mrs. Thompson. Step 3: Establish the initial incident One gloomy Friday evening, Charles heads down to the laundry room to do his weekly laundry. As he enters, he unexpectedly discovers a tall man, LaRoche, silently standing in the corner staring at the washing machines. Charles senses something odd about the situation and decides to investigate further. Step 4: Develop the plot twist As Charles begins to engage LaRoche in conversation, he realizes that the man claims to be from a secret government agency investigating the disappearance of multiple residents within the apartment building. Furthermore, LaRoche divulges that the laundry room potentially holds a hidden entrance to an underground facility involved in nefarious activities. Step 5: Rising action Charles and LaRoche decide to join forces and attempt to uncover the truth about the mysterious underground facility while trying to maintain their cover among the residents of the apartment building. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they garner information from various neighbors, such as pieces of conversation from Mrs. Thompson about odd occurrences and strange noises coming from the laundry room. This fuels Charles' and LaRoche's suspicions. Step 6: Climax After weeks of investigating the disappearance of the residents and the secret entrance, Charles and LaRoche finally discover a hidden passageway in the laundry room, leading to an underground laboratory where experiments regarding mind control are being carried out. In addition, they discover the missing residents, who are being held captive as test subjects for these experiments. Step 7: Falling action Together, Charles and LaRoche formulate a plan to rescue the captured residents and expose the corrupt organization behind the experiments. They rally the rest of the apartment building's residents, including Amy and Mrs. Thompson, who are eager to help. Step 8: Conclusion In the end, Charles, LaRoche, and the other residents successfully overthrow the organization, free the missing residents, and close down the hidden laboratory, putting an end to the dangerous experiments. LaRoche is revealed to be an undercover agent, and he thanks Charles for his assistance in the mission. The residents of the apartment building become closer, and Charles finds inspiration in this experience to finally write his novel, chronicling the thrilling adventure that unfolded beneath their very feet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

House Arrest Lifted, Lindsay Lohan Parties With Emile Hirsch, Pals LOS ANGELES – Lindsay Lohan celebrated completing her 35-day stint under house arrest by hitting the Hollywood social scene into the early hours of Thursday. The troubled starlet joined friends -- including actor Emile Hirsch -- at Lexington Social House by 11:00pm local time Wednesday. The former child star even stumbled as she headed for her car -- but this time, blinding camera flashes rather than alcohol were to blame. Lohan, 24, appeared to be drinking non-alcoholic sodas throughout the night before leaving around 2:00am local time Thursday. PHOTOS: More Pics of Lindsay and Emile Partying.

She was deemed eligible to serve her sentence at home due to jail overcrowding. But Lohan is not yet in the clear. She now needs to dedicate 360 hours to helping at a homeless shelter for women and doing 120 hours of janitorial work at the Los Angeles County morgue as part of her plea deal.

In societies with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; whether this is beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for US DST extensions. A:","output":"DST, or Daylight Saving Time, is a practice that adjusts the clocks in order to provide more afternoon sunlight for outdoor activities in societies with fixed work schedules. This can have various effects on health, including altering sunlight exposure that can either trigger vitamin D synthesis in the skin, which is beneficial, or potentially lead to skin cancer due to overexposure. DST may also have an impact on depression, as the shift in time can cause individuals to rise earlier, but this effect is debated.

What is the solution?","output":"Alright, let's break down this math problem step-by-step, as if I'm explaining it to a five-year-old. We have a math problem that looks like this:  7575 * i = -7563 * i + 15155 * i + 1445 First, let's look at the problem. We are trying to find the value of \\"i\\". Do you see the letter \\"i\\" in the problem? Now, let's gather all the \\"i\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to add 7563 * i to both sides of the equation. When we do that, the problem will look like this: (7575 + 7563) * i = 15155 * i + 1445 Now let's add 7575 and 7563 together. Can you do that? That's right! When we add them, we get 15138. So the problem becomes: 15138 * i = 15155 * i + 1445 Next, we want to get rid of the \\"i\\" terms on the right side. To do that, we can subtract 15138 * i from both sides of the equation. When we do that, it will look like this: 0 = (15155 - 15138) * i + 1445 Now, let's subtract 15138 from 15155. Can you do that? Great! When we subtract those two numbers, we get 17. So our problem becomes:  0 = 17 * i + 1445 Now, we want to get \\"i\\" by itself. So, we need to subtract 1445 from both sides. It will look like this: -1445 = 17 * i Now, to find \\"i\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by 17. When we do that, we get: i = -85 So, the solution to the problem is i = -85.

The over-heated plot of \\"Bonjour tristesse\\" is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan, which became a best-seller, though God knows why. For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal. Don't be taken in by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the step-mother-in- prospect. Unfortunately, too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg. She's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's St. Joan -- Seberg's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film.

That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of acting capacity? Not a chance? Seberg's character is at the center of the story and, pretty though she is, convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old, she can't meet the emotional demands of the role.

Daily Mail Reporter. Jobless people are being offered a course on how to 'design your own tattoo' - paid for by taxpayers. The free sessions on tattoo art paid for by the Labour-run Welsh Government's anti-poverty programme was yesterday blasted as a 'waste of public money'. The skin ink sessions for the unemployed are described a 'free fun interactive course that will develop your artistic skills to be able to design tattoos for yourself and others'. Scroll down for video. A free course for the unemployed on tattoo design has been attacked as a waste of public money (pictured a tattoo artist at work at the London Tattoo Convention on model Lexy Hell) The six-hour course is being run at a series of venues around Bridgend, South Wales, as part of a publicly-funded Communities First scheme to help people get back to work. But leading Lib-Dem Welsh Assembly member Peter Black hit out at the tattoo courses - and said it shows the job-creation scheme is a flop. He said: 'It is difficult to see how this venture can be justified. 'This important regeneration programme is not delivering what is expected of it and now we see it being reduced to fun tattoo design classes.' The Labour Welsh Government has spent around more than £200million on the Communities First scheme over the last ten years - but did not disclose how much is spent on the tattoo course. Mr Black said: 'Tens of millions of pounds have been spent on Communities First over the last decade or so but what indicators that are available show that in employment, health and education terms this money has had little impact. 'The Government needs to revisit how they are spending this money so as to deliver the results we need in helping deprived communities back to work.' The tattoo sessions are being held for free at community centres in Caerau, Cornelly and Sarn areas of Bridgend later this month. The six-hour course is part of a publicly-funded Communities First scheme to help get people back to work. It is aimed to 'support people to acquire the appropriate skills to become job-ready and gain sustainable employment.' A spokesman for Communities and Tackling Poverty Minister Jeff Cuthbert hit back by dubbing the attack as 'snobbish and grossly misleading'. He said: 'The Work Programme publicises the fact that it has found work for young people in this growing industry - is Mr Black complaining about these jobs?' 'The truth is he has seen one advert about one small project in one Communities First area and run to the press without first making proper enquiries about the facts of the matter.' A spokesman for Bridgend council said: 'The \\"Design your own tattoo\\" session should not be taken at face value. 'It is carefully structured to help people develop confidence and important skills in areas such as communication, creative thinking and working with others.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Pick from: (I) Drink grape juice to get rid f the cough.. (II) Drink pineapple juice to get rid f the cough.....I think the answer is","output":"To determine the most effective method for getting rid of coughs, we need to analyze the potential benefits of each option and the available supporting evidence. Step 1: Research potential benefits of grape juice for coughs Upon researching, grape juice does not show any significant properties that may specifically help with cough reduction. It contains vitamins and antioxidants, which can support overall health, but does not appear to be a direct cough remedy. Step 2: Research potential benefits of pineapple juice for coughs Pineapple juice contains bromelain, an enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce the severity of coughs and potentially break down mucus. Bromelain is not found in other commonly consumed fruits, making pineapple juice a unique choice for this task. Step 3: Compare the options and draw a conclusion Comparing the two options, it seems that pineapple juice is more likely to be effective at getting rid of coughs than grape juice. Pineapple juice contains bromelain, which has specific anti-inflammatory properties that can help with coughs, while grape juice does not have any specific properties that target coughs directly. So, the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of using something more effective at getting rid of coughs than cough syrup is: (II) Drink pineapple juice to get rid of the cough."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who recruited several regulars of Blitz to be in a video? ?  Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

We have: 3260 * h + 1995 = 683 * h - 77892 Now, to find h, we must isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting 683 * h from both sides. This will remove h from the right side: (3260 * h - 683 * h) + 1995 = -77892 Now, subtract 683 from 3260: 2577 * h + 1995 = -77892 Next, we need to move 1995 to the other side by subtracting 1995 from both sides: 2577 * h = -77892 - 1995 Now, subtract 1995 from -77892: 2577 * h = -79887 Finally, we must divide by 2577 on both sides to find h: h = -79887 / 2577 Now, when we do that calculation: h ≈ -30.997 So h is approximately -30.997!

The generated questions must require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. Try to use a variety of reasoning types in your questions (some of the sample reasoning types are illustrated in the 'positive examples' field) and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates). A span is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. In such questions, the answer spans are recommended to be five words. Questions with answer type \\"number\\", are expected to start with \\"How many\\". For instance, \\"How long did an event last?\\" can be phrased as \\"How many years did an event last?\\".

Q: Passage: The Panthers looked to stay hot and undefeated as they traveled to MetLife Stadium to take on the Giants, led by two-time Super Bowl winning QB Eli Manning and star WR Odell Beckham Jr., who both had strong performances in a Monday Night shootout at Miami a week earlier. Much of the game was overshadowed by Beckham's and Josh Norman's melees throughout the game, which would lead to Beckham being suspended the following week and both players receiving fines. Carolina led 35-7 late in the third quarter, but the Manning-led Giants stormed back with four touchdowns (the last of which was a pass to Beckham) to tie the game with just under two minutes remaining.  Carolina responded by putting together a quick drive that concluded with a game-winning field goal on the final play of regulation. With the last-second win, the Panthers moved to 14-0 and set a new record for the most wins to start a season by an NFC team. It also made them the fourth team, along with the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the 2007 New England Patriots, and the 2009 Indianapolis Colts to start a season 14-0 in NFL history. A:","output":"Part #1: Creating questions from a given passage that involve complex reasoning. Usage: Q: How many points did the Giants score in their comeback attempt to tie the game? A: 28 (four touchdowns, each worth 7 points).

Part #2: Using a variety of reasoning types in your questions. Usage: Q: Who were the major players involved in the game and what roles did they play? A: Eli Manning (QB for the Giants), Odell Beckham Jr. (WR for the Giants), and Josh Norman (involved in melees with Beckham). This involves understanding different aspects of the passage and relating those information to create a comprehensive answer. Part #3: Having a variety of answer types. Usage: Q: Which teams have started a season 14-0 in NFL history? A: 1972 Miami Dolphins, 2007 New England Patriots, 2009 Indianapolis Colts, and Carolina Panthers.

Usage: Q: Considering the Panthers led 35-7 late in the third quarter and the final score was tied before the Panthers scored a game-winning field goal, how many points did the Panthers score in total? A: 38 (35 points from the lead, plus 3 points from the field goal). This involves addition (35 + 3) to determine the total score for the Panthers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Question: Newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell is forced to attend college by whom? Movie title: Pitch Perfect Movie plot: At a 2011 national a cappella competition, Barden University's all-female a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, perform well until Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) vomits on stage during her solo. They are publicly humiliated, losing the competition. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father (John Benjamin Hickey), a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. Wishing she could instead pursue a career as a music producer in Los Angeles, Beca spends her time making mash-up mixes of songs and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson (Skylar Astin). When Beca's father discovers she has not been attending classes, he comes to her with a proposition: if she joins a club and still does not want to remain at college after one year, he will allow her to leave college, and he will pay for Beca to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. After some persuasion from Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow) the co-leader of the Bellas along with Aubrey, she reluctantly joins the Barden Bellas. Aubrey does not initially approve of recruiting Beca, but yields nonetheless due to a desperate need for members and Beca's talent. Beca joins alongside a group of other women who do not fit the Bellas' typical mold: Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), Stacie Conrad (Alexis Knapp), Lilly Onakuramara (Hana Mae Lee), and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Jesse is also revealed to have joined the Bellas' all-male rival group, the Treblemakers, but his roommate Benji was rejected after being called \\"weird\\" by Bumper. The Bellas participate in the southeastern regional competition at Carolina University where, at Aubrey's insistence, they perform the same medley that helped the Bellas advance to the finals the previous year. In spite of their old set list, the group manages to place second, which sends them to the semi-finals. Unfortunately, disaster strikes for Beca...

Confronting the victim's sister Gail (Sarah Buxton), he proclaims his innocence and vows to return before being he is killed via electric chair. A year passes and Spring Break has come to Miami. Two football players, Skip (Nicolas de Toth) and Ronny (Rawley Valverde) are amongst the partygoers for the week-long festivities. While Spring Break is occurring, a mysterious biker appears and begins to dispatch people. The back of his bike has a lever that when pulled (combined with a button pushed by the biker) causes the victim to undergo a treatment similar to the electric chair. When Ronny ends up a victim of the mysterious killer, Skip attempts to find Ronny with the help of Gail, who works as a bartender during Spring Break. The duo soon find Ronny and learn that local police chief Strycher (John Saxon) and physician Doc Willet (Michael Parks) have covered up Ronny's death in order for the partygoers not to worry. However, as the body count rises, Gail and Skip begin to wonder if Diablo made good on his promise to return from the dead or is someone else responsible. A confrontation at a local tire yard between Gail and the biker reveals that the killer is Reverend Bates (Lance Le Gault), who thinks Spring Break is nothing more than an excuse for sins. Considering himself a \\"guardian angel\\", he feels all sinners must die like Diablo, \\"death by electrocution\\". Bates also confesses to being the real killer of Gail's sister. Skip arrives in time and fights off Bates. As the duo run, Bates hops on his bike and goes after them only to trip his bike on a stray tire.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  I am facing a new situation today: After working out in the yard for the day doing various chores, Karen comes back inside to prepare for a shower. While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which arm's blood vessels are more dilated? Answer:","output":"The blood vessels in Karen's right arm are more dilated.  Justification: In the provided context, the cut on Karen's right arm is described as red and easy to see, whereas the cut on her left arm is hardly noticeable. According to the background information, redness and visibility of a cut or injury are the results of inflammation which causes dilation, or expansion, of blood vessels. It specifically mentions that \\"The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm.\\" Therefore, based on these observations and the information provided, it can be inferred that the blood vessels in Karen's right arm, around the area of the noticeable cut, are more dilated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When Erin sneezed they used a handkerchief to cover their nose but Jennifer didn't ,so dad praised  Choices: * Erin highly.. * Jennifer highly..","output":"When Erin sneezed, they used a handkerchief to cover their nose, but Jennifer didn't, so dad praised Erin highly. In this scenario, it is evident that Erin demonstrates responsible and hygienic behavior by using a handkerchief when they sneezed, which helps prevent the spread of germs and viruses. This act of consideration towards their surroundings and the people around them is something worthy of praise. On the other hand, Jennifer failed to follow a similar practice, as she didn't cover her nose when she sneezed. This is considered inconsiderate and could potentially lead to the spread of germs and viruses. The father, in this situation, acknowledges Erin's responsible behavior by praising them highly. This could serve a dual purpose — not only does it reward Erin for exhibiting good manners and adhering to hygienic practices, but it also acts as an indirect reminder or lesson for Jennifer to follow suit and adapt her behavior accordingly. The scenario described in the sentence portrays the importance of teaching children about basic hygiene practices, as well as the significance of acknowledging and appreciating their efforts.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose family had strong left-wing political commitments? is inside the article: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

Write a question about the following article: In week 5, the Bears recorded the highest margin of victory of the season, defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars 41-3. In the first quarter, the Bears scored first on a Robbie Gould 32-yard field goal, though Jacksonville would respond in the next quarter on Josh Scobee's 31-yard kick. In the second half, the Bears broke the deadlock by kicking another field goal and cornerback Charles Tillman returning a Blaine Gabbert interception 36 yards for a touchdown, breaking former Bears safety Mike Brown's franchise record for the most pick-sixes in a career. Tillman also tied Donnell Woolford for the most interceptions by a cornerback in team history. In the fourth quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 10-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Chicago would then extend their lead on Cutler's 24-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to increase the lead to 27-3. Bears linebacker Lance Briggs would then intercept Gabbert and score on a 36-yard return. Briggs and Tillman would become the first pair in league history to return interceptions for touchdowns in consecutive games, and the Bears became the first team in NFL history to return five interceptions for touchdowns in the first five games of a season. The Bears would close out the game with backup running back Armando Allen scoring on a 46-yard touchdown run. The victory improved the team's record to 4-1. The victory is the most lopsided win for the Bears since their 1985 44-0 victory over the Cowboys, and the 38 points scored in the second half are the most since the team scoring 49 second half points in the 1941 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

As technology advances and consumer behavior shifts, advertisers adapt and grow their strategies to stay relevant. While some have gone as far as claiming that advertising is dying amidst this constant change, this statement couldn't be further from the truth. Advertising is far from dead, but the market is changing in unprecedented ways. Here, we explore the current state of advertising and its trajectory in the ever-evolving digital landscape. The Prominence of Digital Advertising Step 1 - Highlight the growth of digital advertising To illustrate the changing landscape, one must first look at the rapid growth of digital advertising. With the arrival of smartphones, social media, and online video platforms, a significant portion of advertising budgets have shifted towards digital channels. Not only does digital advertising offer more targeted and personalized experiences, but it also provides richer data and analytics for advertisers to develop even more effective campaigns. The Rise of Native Advertising and Sponsored Content Step 2 - Discuss the rise of native advertising and sponsored content In the current digital landscape, consumers are increasingly resistant to traditional display ads. As a result, the rise of native advertising and sponsored content has taken center stage. By blending into a publisher's content feed and providing value to users through engaging stories, these non-intrusive ads effectively reach target audiences. The Importance of Influencer Marketing Step 3 - Talk about the role of influencer marketing in the advertising landscape Influencer marketing is an increasingly important pillar in the advertising industry. This trend leverages the popularity and credibility of individuals, such as celebrities, YouTube stars, or bloggers, to promote products or services through their social media channels. The modern consumer values authenticity, and influencer marketing enables brands to connect with customers on a more personal level.  The Shift Towards Programmatic Advertising Step 4 - Expound on the shift towards programmatic advertising The automation of media buying and selling through programmatic advertising is changing the game for advertisers. This technology-driven approach provides better targeting, real-time analytics, and cost efficiency. The flexibility it offers allows advertisers to take a more sophisticated approach to reach specific audience segments. The Prevalence of Ad Blockers and the Fight for Attention Step 5 - Address the challenge of ad blockers and strategies to overcome them With ad blockers becoming more prevalent, advertisers face the difficult challenge of reaching audiences while respecting their preferences. It has given rise to new methods of ad delivery, incentive-based models, and greater focus on creating engaging, non-intrusive content. This shift further underscores the need for advertisers to be innovative and adapt to the changing environment. Conclusion As the world shifts towards a more digital-heavy landscape, the advertising industry is undergoing a metamorphosis. Digital advertising, native ads, influencer marketing, programmatic advertising, and the rise of ad blockers are just a few examples of how the market is changing. In the face of these challenges and opportunities, advertisers must be agile and innovative, constantly adapting their strategies to stay ahead. Advertising may be evolving, but it is far from dead. In fact, the market is alive and thriving, with new opportunities emerging throughout every corner of the digital landscape."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a similar term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period. The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500–1400) and the Renaissance (1400–1600) eras; the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), and Romantic eras (1804–1910); and the 20th century (1901–2000) which includes the modern (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary or postmodern (1975–2015) eras.[citation needed] What time period is known at the common practice period?

Q:Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition.  Pete and Mike were two brothers. Pete had no health problems, while Mike inherited the sickle cell trait. Mike had adjacent health problems.  Which brother didn't have molecules of hemoglobin that aggregate? A:","output":"The brother who did not have molecules of hemoglobin that aggregate was Pete. In the given information, it was mentioned that Pete had no health problems.  This implies that Pete did not inherit the gene for sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease from his parents, thus resulting in the normal functioning of his hemoglobin. Hemoglobin, a protein molecule located in red blood cells, is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. In its normal form, it does not aggregate or clump together. On the other hand, Mike, who inherited the sickle cell trait, had some of his hemoglobin functioning as Hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin S is an abnormal form of hemoglobin, caused by a genetic mutation, that tends to aggregate under certain conditions such as low oxygen levels. This aggregation deforms the red blood cells into a sickle or crescent shape, which can cause a variety of health problems. Sickle cell trait is when a person inherits the gene for hemoglobin S from one parent, while the other parent provides a gene for normal hemoglobin. So, while a percentage of Mike's hemoglobin is Hemoglobin S and can aggregate, not all his hemoglobin is abnormal. This usually results in fewer symptoms compared to sickle cell disease, which occurs when a person inherits two genes for Hemoglobin S. However, it's mentioned that Mike had adjacent health problems, which could possibly be linked to this trait, depending on their nature and severity. But in direct answer to the question, the brother whose hemoglobin did not aggregate was Pete since only normal hemoglobin was mentioned, implying no sickling or abnormal shape changes in his red blood cells. Therefore, Pete did not have the condition of sickle cell trait or disease."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It came as he ordered a belated inquiry into the abuse scandal and offered an apology to Savile’s victims. He expressed ‘deep regret’ over ‘these awful allegations’ as he announced his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry was necessary. Apology: BBC director-general George Entwistle expressed 'deep regret' over 'these awful allegations' as he announced his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry was necessary Investigations: Detectives are to probe whether Sir OPTIONS: - BBC ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - BBC Radio 4 ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - George Entwistle ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - Newsnight Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - Radio 4 ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - Sam Greenhill ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice","output":"In this ending, investigators discover that Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women came forward naming a former corporation employee as being his accomplice. With this new information, the BBC is forced to confront the shocking reality of a dark and hidden past involving not only the late Sir Jimmy Savile but also other employees within the organization.  As a result of this revelation, George Entwistle, the BBC director-general, is compelled to take swift action to address the abuse scandal. He launches a comprehensive internal investigation, hiring outside experts to examine the BBC's workplace culture, policies, and procedures to ensure that the organization is doing everything possible to prevent any further abuse from happening. The investigation ultimately uncovers a series of coverups that took place over several decades, allowing the abuse to continue. Several high-profile employees, including some on-air personalities, are implicated in these coverups, leading to numerous resignations and dismissals within the organization. Entwistle personally apologizes to the victims of the abuse and pledges to make significant changes within the BBC to ensure that such abuse never happens again. In response to the scandal, the British government establishes a new public inquiry, examining not only the actions of the BBC but also those of other major media institutions to ensure they are doing all they can to prevent abuse and protect vulnerable individuals. This inquiry, known as the Independent Public Commission, becomes a long-term watchdog committed to ensuring that the media industry maintains high standards for employee safety and well-being. The brutal revelations about Savile and the wider sex ring begin a cultural shift within the media industry and British society as a whole. As awareness of the abuse grows, more and more victims come forward, inspiring others to share their experiences and seek justice. Through the inquiry, the government and the media are forced to confront their complicity in silencing the voices of victims and allowing powerful abusers to act with impunity. In time, the BBC emerges as a more transparent and accountable organization, with stronger safeguards to protect its employees and the people who interact with them. Workplace cultures change for the better, and the Savile scandal becomes a pivotal moment in history, leading to significant progress in addressing and preventing abuse not only within the BBC but throughout the media industry and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Serving as a key international gateway to Japan, the airport is a hub for domestic and international flights, as well as a major cargo center. Constructed in 1978 as New Tokyo International Airport, it was later renamed as Narita International Airport in 2004. The airport plays a crucial role in connecting Japan with other parts of the world and serves as a hub for several Japanese and international airlines, such as All Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan Airlines (JAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and many more. Narita Airport consists of three terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3. Terminals 1 and 2 are primarily for international flights, while Terminal 3 is dedicated to low-cost carriers and domestic flights.

Question: What is El Greco's largest adversary? Movie title: El Greco Movie plot: The film tells the story of Domenicos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, a great Greek artist of the 16th century with an uncompromising character, who sets off from his homeland Crete and goes to Venice and finally Toledo, in search of freedom and love. There he is confronted by his greatest adversary, the Spanish Inquisition, but his creative consciousness and power make him stand out and overcome barbarity and ignorance. Being imprisoned and awaiting execution by the Spanish Inquisition, Domenicos (Nick Ashdon) writes out his story, thus parts of his life play out in extended flashbacks. Born on the island of Crete, which was at the time part of the Republic of Venice, he falls in love with Francesca (Dimitra Matsouka), daughter of the Venetian governor of Crete. But his father is preparing a political rebellion and as a result Domenicos leaves the island and moves to Venice, away from the young woman. There he meets the famous painter Titian (Sotiris Moustakas) and the Spanish priest Fernando NiÃ±o de Guevara (Juan Diego Botto).

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\"  and the situation: Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time.  Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation.  Answer the following question: Who is more likely to die after this event? A:","output":"Michael is more likely to die after this event due to his exposure to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. This acute exposure to ionizing radiation can lead to Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), which is characterized by symptoms such as skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and even death depending on the severity of exposure.  On the other hand, Robert was in the adjacent room and was exposed to a significantly lower dose of radiation. While any radiation exposure poses a risk, individuals exposed to low doses of radiation are at a comparatively lower probability of experiencing immediate health effects. The primary concern for Robert would be the potential long-term risk of developing cancer or experiencing genetic damage due to the radiation exposure. However, it is important to note that calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation remains a challenging and uncertain task. Current estimates are generally based on population data from historical events such as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as reactor accidents like Chernobyl. Nonetheless, given the known dangers associated with high doses of radiation exposure, it is clear that Michael's situation is more immediately life-threatening and, as a result, he is more likely to die following this event compared to Robert."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Meditation was an aspect of the practice of the yogis in the centuries preceding the Buddha. The Buddha built upon the yogis' concern with introspection and developed their meditative techniques, but rejected their theories of liberation. In Buddhism, mindfulness and clear awareness are to be developed at all times; in pre-Buddhist yogic practices there is no such injunction. A yogi in the Brahmanical tradition is not to practice while defecating, for example, while a Buddhist monastic should do so.

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of e-commerce, further accentuating the gap between online and physical retail. Wal-Mart's attempt to compete directly with Amazon through its subscription service, Walmart+, has had a tumultuous start. Despite offering perks such as free shipping and discounts on groceries and fuel, the service has not gained the traction that its Amazon counterpart, Amazon Prime, has enjoyed. Moreover, the retail giant has struggled to replicate its domestic success on a global scale. While it remains one of the largest retailers in terms of global presence, it has faced difficulties adapting to local market trends and consumer preferences. Recent divestitures in regions such as the United Kingdom and Japan signify challenges that Wal-Mart has encountered in global expansion. Impact on the Dow Jones Industrial Average: As an indicator of overall economic conditions, the Dow Jones index draws its value from the collective performance of its 30 component companies, including Wal-Mart. Given that the shares of these companies are weighted by price, fluctuations in any component can significantly affect the index. In this case, the decline in Wal-Mart's shares has impacted the Dow Jones index substantially. Investors are acutely aware that changes to Wal-Mart’s stock can have broader ramifications when it comes to the health of the Dow Jones. Wal-Mart's significant role in the U.S. economy as one of the largest private employers and retail organisations means that its financial performance has a direct impact on the nation's economic health. As a result, the slump in Wal-Mart shares may be viewed as a leading indicator of underlying economic vulnerabilities, particularly in the retail sector. The Future Outlook: Retail analysts have offered diverse opinions regarding the future prospects of Wal-Mart. Some argue that the company's vast resources and deeply entrenched supply chain give it a competitive edge that should not be underestimated. Others, however, have expressed concerns that the company is overly reliant on its domestic operations, leaving it vulnerable to competitive pressures from Amazon and other e-commerce competitors. In response to changing consumer trends, Wal-Mart has continually adapted its business model in a bid to weather the storm. This has included a focus on sustainability, an increased emphasis on e-commerce, and a commitment to elevate employee benefits. Despite setbacks and ongoing challenges, the company remains a force to be reckoned with in the retail landscape. Conclusion: Wal-Mart's sharp fall in shares has indeed dragged the Dow Jones index lower, reflecting the ongoing challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retail establishments. The implications of this serve as a reminder of the interconnected nature of our global economy and the importance of adaptability in an ever-evolving business landscape. The retail titan's efforts to streamline its operations and stay relevant in an increasingly digital world underscore the importance of innovation in response to shifting consumer demands. As the retail industry continues to evolve in the face of digital disruption, the fortunes of Wal-Mart and the Dow Jones index will likely remain closely connected."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cold can affect other parts of the body.The expression \\"get cold feet\\" has nothing to do with cold or your feet.The expression means being afraid to do something you have decided to do.For example, you agree to be president of an organization.But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned, and all the work of the organizations will be your responsibility.You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation. The expression \\"give someone the cold shoulder\\" probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face to face.You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you.Or, to someone who has lied about you to others. A cold fish is not a fish.It is a person.But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth.A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted.Now a cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy.Several popular songs in recent years were about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feelings, broke the hearts of their lovers. \\"Out in the cold\\" means not getting something that everybody else got.A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise----he was left out in the cold.And it is not a pleasant place to be.

Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction.

In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

Here is a detailed and long answer providing information about the Treaty of Lisbon, Lithuania's involvement, and its relation to the ECHR: The Treaty of Lisbon, signed on December 13, 2007, was an international agreement that amended the two treaties establishing the constitutional basis for the European Union (EU). The main objective of the Treaty of Lisbon was to streamline the EU institutions and improve their functioning, ensuring a more stable and efficient way for the organization to operate. Lithuania was one of the 27 member states of the European Union that signed this treaty. As a member state, Lithuania agreed to the terms and changes proposed by the Treaty of Lisbon, which increased the power and influence of the European Parliament and introduced the European Council's permanent presidency. Additionally, the treaty created the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, while also removing the pillar structure of the EU. Furthermore, by signing the Treaty of Lisbon, Lithuania also became a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR is a regional human rights treaty, drafted in 1950 by the Council of Europe, to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms within its member states. The European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, France, plays a crucial role in enforcing the provisions of the ECHR. As a signatory to the ECHR, Lithuania committed to upholding and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms outlined within the convention. This includes ensuring the right to life, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression, and the right to free elections. In summary, Lithuania's signing of the Treaty of Lisbon solidified its commitment to the European Union's goals and values, while also binding the country to adhere to the principles of human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Question: \\"How much are lawyers paying for their registration fees now?\\" Response: \\"90\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Possible answers:  a). no.  b). yes.","output":"a). no. The response \\"90\\" is incorrect because that fee only applies to lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive. According to the text, the base fee for active attorneys was raised to 180 from 140. So, the correct registration fee for active lawyers is 180, not 90."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one .  - Robert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925  November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and film producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a \\"maverick\\" in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.  - Assassination is the murder of a prominent person, often a political leader or ruler, usually for political reasons or payment.  - An underground film is a film that is out of the mainstream either in its style, genre, or financing.  - John Joseph Travolta (born February 18, 1954) is an American actor, producer, dancer, and singer. Travolta first became known in the 1970s, after appearing on the television series \\"Welcome Back, Kotter\\" (19751979) and starring in the box office successes \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977) and \\"Grease\\" (1978). His acting career declined through the 1980s, but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s with his role in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994), and he has since starred in films such as \\"Face/Off\\" (1997), \\"Swordfish\\" (2001), \\"Wild Hogs\\", and \\"Hairspray\\" (both 2007).  - A cult following is a group of fans who are highly dedicated to a work of culture. A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, will be said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a community. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters.  - Alicia Christian \\"Jodie\\" Foster (born November 19, 1962) is an American actress and filmmaker who has worked in films and on television. She has often been cited as one of the best actresses of her generation. Foster began her career at the age of three as a child model in 1965, and two years later moved to acting in television series, with the sitcom \\"Mayberry R.F.D.\\" being her debut. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she worked in several primetime television series and starred in children's films. Foster's breakthrough came in Martin Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver\\" (1976), in which she played a teenage prostitute; the role garnered her a nomination for an Academy Award. Her other critically acclaimed roles as a teenager were in the musical \\"Bugsy Malone\\" (1976) and the thriller \\"The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane\\" (1976), and she became a popular teen idol by starring in Disney's \\"Freaky Friday\\" (1976), \\"Candleshoe\\" (1977) and \\"Foxes\\" (1980).  - Blow Out is a 1981 American thriller film written and directed by Brian De Palma. The film stars John Travolta as Jack Terry, a movie sound effects technician from Philadelphia who, while recording sounds for a low-budget slasher film, serendipitously captures audio evidence of an assassination involving a presidential hopeful. Nancy Allen stars as Sally Bedina, a young woman involved in the crime. The supporting cast includes John Lithgow and Dennis Franz. The film's tagline in advertisements was, \\"Murder has a sound all of its own\\".  - Slasher films are a subgenre of horror films, typically involving a violent psychopath stalking and murdering several people, usually with bladed tools. Although the term \\"slasher\\" is sometimes used informally as a generic term for any horror movie involving murder, analysts of the genre cite an established set of characteristics which set these films apart from other horror subgenres, such as splatter films and psychological horror films.  - Art historians and philosophers of art have long had classificatory disputes about art regarding whether a particular cultural form or piece of work should be classified as art. Disputes about what does and does not count as art continue to occur today.  - A talent agent, or booking agent, is a person who finds jobs for actors, authors, film directors, musicians, models, professional athletes, writers, screenwriters, broadcast journalists, and other people in various entertainment or broadcast businesses. In addition, an agent defends, supports and promotes the interest of their clients. Talent agencies specialize, either by creating departments within the agency or developing entire agencies that primarily or wholly represent one specialty. For example, there are modeling agencies, commercial talent agencies, literary agencies, voice-over agencies, broadcast journalist agencies, sports agencies, music agencies and many more.  - In the motion picture industry, a \\"box office bomb\\" or \\"box office flop\\" is a film that is viewed as highly unsuccessful or unprofitable during its theatrical run, sometimes preceding hype regarding its cost, production, or marketing efforts. Generally, any film for which the production and marketing costs exceed the combined revenue recovered after release is considered to have \\"bombed\\".  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - Brian Russell De Palma (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. He is considered part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking.  - Jonathan Kaplan (born November 25, 1947) is an American film producer and director. His film \\"The Accused\\" (1988) earned actress Jodie Foster her first Oscar for Best Actress and was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival. Kaplan received five Emmy nominations for his roles directing and producing \\"ER\\".  - The Golden Bear is the highest prize awarded for the best film at the Berlin International Film Festival. The bear is the heraldic animal of Berlin, featured on both the coat of arms and flag of Berlin.  - Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter.  - George Litto is an American film producer and talent agent . His production credits include Robert Altman 's Thieves Like Us ( 1974 ) , Jonathan Kaplan 's cult film Over the Edge ( 1979 ) , and three Brian De Palma thrillers , Obsession ( 1976 ) , Dressed to Kill ( 1980 ) and Blow Out ( 1981 ) .  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - John Arthur Lithgow (; born , 1945) is an American actor, musician, singer, and author. He has received two Tony Awards, five Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, an American Comedy Award, four Drama Desk Awards and has also been nominated for two Academy Awards and four Grammy Awards. Lithgow has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and has been inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.  - A cult film, also commonly referred to as a cult classic, is a film that has acquired a cult following. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. The term \\"cult film\\" itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though \\"cult\\" was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.  - The Academy Award for Best Director (officially known as the Academy Award for Best Directing) is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, .

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of less food being put into the mouth and resulting in less food traveling to the small intestine would be considered as directly impacting a step of the process. This is because the alteration in the quantity of food consumed directly affects the subsequent steps in the process of digestion and nutrient absorption. When less food is ingested, the amount of food that is chewed, mixed with saliva, and swallowed is also reduced. Consequently, this directly impacts the amount of food that enters the stomach, the amount of acid produced for digestion, and eventually, the food that travels to the small intestine. The direct impact on the process can be observed in the following ways: 1. Chewing and saliva mixing: Since less food is put into the mouth, the amount of food that needs to be chewed and mixed with saliva is also reduced. This can lead to faster completion of this step, giving the person more time to savor each bite and also potentially enhancing the overall digestion process. 2. Swallowing and esophageal movement: With less food to swallow, the esophagus has to perform fewer contractions to push the food into the stomach. This might result in a quicker and potentially more comfortable swallowing experience. 3. Stomach digestion: As there is less food entering the stomach, the organ is not as full, which can lead to quicker breakdown and processing of the food by stomach acid. This can also have an impact on the possible sensation of fullness or discomfort that one might feel during digestion. 4. Nutrient absorption in the small intestine: With the reduced amount of food passing into the small intestine from the stomach, the absorption of nutrients will also decrease proportionately. This could potentially lead to faster passage of the food through the small intestine. 5. Waste elimination from the large intestine: Since the body processes and absorbs nutrients from less food, the amount of waste generated would also be less. This can affect the bowel movement frequency and might lead to quicker elimination of waste from the large intestine or changes in the overall bowel movement experience. In conclusion, the perturbation of consuming less food directly impacts the process of digestion and nutrient absorption. The ramifications of this change may bear influence on the experience of chewing, swallowing, digestion, and waste elimination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Photo: Larry Busacca/Getty Images      Theranos Inc. withdrew its request for emergency clearance of a Zika-virus blood test after federal regulators found that the company didn’t include proper patient safeguards in a study of the new test, said people familiar with the matter.      The move is another setback for the Palo Alto, Calif., company as it tries to recover from crippling regulatory sanctions that followed revelations by The Wall Street Journal of shortcomings in Theranos’s technology and operations. Theranos has said it is appealing.      Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes announced Aug. 1 a new blood-testing device called miniLab that she said was designed for use outside a clinical laboratory and could run accurate tests from a few drops of blood.      Ms. Holmes also said Theranos was seeking clearance for its Zika test, and a company news release said Theranos had collected finger-stick blood samples from patients, including in the Dominican Republic, and run the tests on the new miniLab device, which showed that the Zika test worked.      But during an inspection by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this month, regulators concluded that Theranos had collected some data supporting the accuracy of the Zika test without implementing a patient-safety protocol approved by an institutional review board, according to the people familiar with the matter. Institutional review boards ensure that patients are treated safely and ethically during medical studies.      “We hope that our decision to withdraw the Zika submission voluntarily is further evidence of our commitment to engage positively with the agency,” said Dave Wurtz, Theranos’s vice president of regulatory, quality and clinical affairs. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the inspection, citing the agency’s policy on pending product applications.      It isn’t clear if the problem affected any patients. Some data in the submission was collected under review-board-approved protocols, the people said. Theranos didn’t contest the agency’s findings and withdrew its submission for authorization of the new Zika test, according to people familiar with the matter.      Theranos executives told employees about the setback during a staff meeting last week, one person familiar with the meeting said.      In an email to Theranos investors Saturday, the company said it plans to collect additional data requested by the FDA under properly reviewed protocols and resubmit the Zika application. The letter said Theranos would handle a submission for an Ebola test “in the same manner.”      The miniLab that Ms. Holmes, Theranos’s chief executive, unveiled to laboratory scientists in Philadelphia signaled a potential shift in the closely held company’s business model and a new source of revenue. FDA approval of the miniLab would allow Theranos to sell the device for outside use even if she is banned from owning or running a lab for at least two years.      The federal agency that oversees labs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, imposed the ban and other penalties in July because of problems it found at a Theranos lab. The agency said the deficiencies affected test accuracy and put patients at risk.      Theranos is appealing the lab’s closing, Ms. Holmes’s ban and other sanctions imposed by CMS and is continuing to negotiate a possible settlement.      Theranos also has said it is doing no patient testing at the lab where the deficiencies were found. In its investor email Saturday, Theranos said its appeal will argue that CMS hasn’t “fully accounted for the progress we have made toward correcting” problems.      A CMS spokesman said Tuesday the agency is “reviewing a copy of Theranos’s appeal.” He declined further comment.      Theranos has pursued a manufacturing-focused business model before. An initial agreement with former retail partner Walgreens, now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., WBA 0.14 % called for Theranos to sell blood-testing devices directly to the drugstore giant and have Walgreens perform the tests, according to a 2010 contract between the two companies.      The arrangement later shifted as Theranos sought tighter control over its proprietary technology and operations, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Michael Polzin, a Walgreens spokesman, declined to comment.      The FDA’s inspection in August was triggered by Theranos’s request for “emergency-use authorization” to sell its new Zika test, a person familiar with the matter said.      The FDA has cleared Zika tests from several other companies since invoking a rule allowing the agency to lower hurdles for new medical products during emergencies.      An epidemic of the mosquito-borne Zika virus has swept through parts of South and Central America and reached into South Florida in recent months. The virus can cause serious birth defects in developing fetuses, including distinctively undersized heads and brain abnormalities.      Theranos’s news release on Aug. 1 as Ms. Holmes spoke at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry’s annual meeting said the company believed no other test for Zika that uses tiny blood samples collected by finger sticks was available.      “Theranos scientists conducted the tests reflected in the AACC presentation in 2016 under IRB-approved protocols,” the company added, referring to the review-board process.      Theranos told investors that company officials “recognized” during the FDA’s inspection that some patient data was collected before the review-board protocols were in place.      After an inspection in August 2015, the FDA declared Theranos’s finger-stick collection device, called the “nanotainer,” an uncleared medical device, and the company said it stopped using it on patients in the U.S. The agency earlier approved the use of nanotainers for a herpes test.      Theranos said in its news release that it used the nanotainer as part of its blood-collection system for the Zika study, which included the Dominican patients.      Separately, Theranos’s general counsel, Heather King, is leaving the company to return to law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, according to the email sent to investors.      Theranos announced Ms. King’s hiring in May 2015, and she led the company’s legal response to accusations of technological snags. Boies Schiller Chairman David Boies is a Theranos director.      “We appreciate Heather’s leadership and we wish her the very best,” Theranos said in its email to investors Saturday.      In a sign that the blows to Theranos’s credibility during the past year continue to hang over the company, leaders of the University of Washington’s medical laboratory division balked when a Theranos manager approached the lab in late July about working with Theranos on research.      “This is a disgraced company that has not responded to the sanctions in an honorable way,” the lab’s compliance officer wrote in an email to the University of Washington technician who fielded the inquiry from Theranos. “As such, do not set up a client account for this company,” according to the email, which was reviewed by the Journal.      Write to John Carreyrou at john.carreyrou@wsj.com and Christopher Weaver at christopher.weaver@wsj.com ||||| The embattled blood testing firm's move comes after regulators found Theranos failed to implement proper patient safeguards in its study. (Reuters)      It was supposed to be the beginning of a new era when Elizabeth Holmes, the chief executive of the beleaguered blood-testing company Theranos, took the stage at a major scientific conference earlier this month and presented a new technology and data on a Zika test. The company, Holmes told thousands of scientists, had already submitted the test to federal regulators for emergency-use authorization.      But federal inspectors visited Theranos soon after and found that some of the Zika data collection had gone forward without an essential safeguard to prevent patient harm, according to a Wall Street Journal report published late Tuesday. The company confirmed that it has withdrawn its Zika test from consideration.      The setback comes as a separate agency — the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — considers Theranos's appeal of harsh sanctions that included a two-year ban on Holmes owning or operating a laboratory after numerous deficiencies were found at its Newark, Calif. laboratory.      \\"It's unfortunate for Theranos to be caught in another compliance issue so soon after the major issues were reported with their clinical testing laboratory,\\" Stephen Master, director of the central lab at Weill Cornell Medical College, wrote in an email. \\"Given the amount of scrutiny they're under, I would have expected them to be particularly careful about the regulatory issues surrounding research on human subjects.\\"      [How Theranos’s reboot could backfire]      Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported that inspectors found that some of Theranos's Zika data was collected without approval by an institutional review board, a committee that performs a critical stopgap function in medicine — overseeing and monitoring research, to make sure it doesn't pose a threat to patient safety.      \\"The FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current/pending product applications,\\" agency spokeswoman Tara Goodin wrote in an email.      According to the company's earlier news release about the Zika test, finger-stick blood samples were collected from patients in the Dominican Republic and shipped to Palo Alto, Calif., where the company is headquartered. That release also specified that the data that were presented in its scientific presentation in early August were conducted under protocols that had been approved by an institutional review board.      The company plans to resubmit the test for approval.      “In my mind, this was a positive interaction with the FDA, and I’m grateful for its collaborative approach,\\" Dave Wurtz, Theranos's vice president of regulatory, quality and clinical affairs said in a statement. \\"We hope that our decision to withdraw the Zika submission voluntarily is further evidence of our commitment to engage positively with the agency. We are confident in the Zika tests and will resubmit it.”      Theranos also announced last week that it was appealing sanctions imposed by regulators.      Since the announcement of the sanctions, \\"Theranos has made substantial progress toward correcting the deficiencies CMS identified, including appointing new laboratory leadership; enhancing Theranos’ clinical policies and procedures; and revamping training programs,\\" the company said in a statement.      CMS spokesman Tony Salters said the appeal is under review and that as with any ongoing enforcement issue, the agency would not comment further.

Theranos pulled the emergency request for its Zika-testing miniLab following an FDA inspection that revealed shortcomings with patient protocol, according to The Wall Street Journal . WSJ's sources say that while the blood-testing company had data showing that the testing methods worked, the evidence collected was done without \\"implementing a patient-safety protocol approved by an institutional review board.\\"      Meaning, the experiments didn't have the type of oversight necessary to ensure that they were performed in stringent, controlled ways that would consistently provide accurate results and wouldn't harm the test subjects. The company says that it \\"recognized\\" that some of its data was gleaned before the needed protocols were in place.      Theranos plans to appeal the Food and Drug Administration's ruling, of course, and collect the extra information requested by the FDA before trying the certification process again. Same goes for when the company attempts certification for its Ebola test as well.      The miniLab itself was a way to sidestep founder Elizabeth Holmes' two-year ban from owning or running a lab or her own, precisely because the device was made for outside use. All of this raises the question of how long Jennifer Lawrence will have to wait for a final script for Theranos: The Movie. Seriously, this saga just keeps getting better. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Blood testing firm Theranos voluntarily withdrew its request for emergency clearance of a blood test for the Zika virus after federal regulators found that it failed to include proper patient safeguards in a study, representing another setback for the firm, which is trying to recover from crippling regulatory sanctions following revelations by The Wall Street Journal of shortcomings in its technology and operations.

A:","output":"A full moon occurs when the Earth is positioned exactly or nearly directly between the sun and the moon. This means both celestial bodies lie opposite to each other in the Earth's sky, causing the moon's full face illuminated by the sun to become visible from the Earth's perspective.  In more detailed terms, the moon orbits the Earth once every 27.3 days, an interval called the sidereal month, but due to the Earth's own movement around the sun, the so-called Synodic month, the time from one full moon to another, actually takes about 29.5 days. Throughout its orbit, the moon passes through different stages known as phases, and these phases correspond to the amount of sunlight reflecting from the moon to our eyes.  A full moon is one of these phases and it occurs when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun. Due to its position, the sun illuminates the side of the moon facing the Earth completely, giving it a circular appearance. From sunrise to sunset, the full moon sits low in the sky and begins to rise higher as the sun sets because they are on opposite sides of the earth.  However, it's important to note that during most full moons, the alignment is not absolutely perfect. If it were, the Earth's shadow would darken the full moon, causing a lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipses only happen a few times a year because the moon's orbit is tilted about 5 degrees relative to Earth's orbit around the sun, preventing perfect alignment most of the time.  During a full moon, the gravitational forces from the Earth and sun pull the moon from different directions, causing tides to be somewhat higher than at other times. This phenomenon is known as a spring tide, which has nothing to do with the season but refers to the action of jumping or springing up.  Culturally, the full moon has been symbolically significant to humans from time immemorial. It appears in various forms in art, literature, mythology, and even influences agricultural schedules in many cultures. Each full moon has different names based on certain cultures too, like the Harvest Moon, the Hunter's Moon, or the Blue Moon, each with its unique folklore and symbolism."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Bears, seeking to avoid going 0-3 at home for the first time in ten years, hosted the Miami Dolphins in week seven, trailing the all-time series 4-7, though the Bears won the most recent game in 2010, 16-0. The Bears had struggled at home during the season, scoring a total of 37 points and a -4 turnover differential; in contrast, the Bears had an average score of 26.5 and a +6 turnover difference on the road. In addition, Jay Cutler had nine passing touchdowns, two interceptions and a 104.6 passer rating in away games, while having four touchdowns, four interceptions (three of which occurred in the second half) and a rating of 84.7 at home, with a rating of 58.1 after halftime. Chicago had to protect Cutler from the defensive line duo of Cameron Wake and Olivier Vernon, both recording 1.5 sacks each in the previous week against the Packers. In addition, the Dolphins were ranked second in the league in sacks on third and fourth downs with 10. However, the Bears' receivers posed a size threat to the Miami secondary, though Miami was ranked third in yards per pass attempt allowed with 6.09, one of only eight teams allowing less than seven yards in 2014. The Dolphins also allowed only 3.8 yards per carry and yards allowed per play with 4.7 yards. On defense, the Bears would have to prepare for a Ryan Tannehill-led zone-read option offense, which has an average drive length of 3:08, third-fastest in the league. However, Tannehill could make mistakes, as he had thrown 35 interceptions in 37 career starts. The Dolphins also had the second-fewest completions of at least 20 yards with 11. The Bears would also have to watch the run game, which ranked third in the NFL with 4.97 yards per carry. Entering the game, the Bears' defense was tied for the fourth-most sacks (15), third-most interceptions (eight), and third in points recorded off turnovers (49). The Bears were the favorite by -3. Terrance Mitchell, Ahmad Dixon, Chris Conte, Lance Briggs, Jon Bostic, Charles Leno, Jr., and Trevor Scott were scratches for the game, while Jermon Bushrod, Brandon Marshall, Robbie Gould, Ryan Mundy and Jeremiah Ratliff were team captains. The Dolphins won the toss, and elected to receive. On the first play from scrimmage, Tannehill was sacked by Ratliff for a loss of five yards; Ratliff would finish the game with a career-high 3.5 sacks. After both teams punted on their first drives, the Dolphins scored first on Tannehill's 13-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay. On the Bears' next drive, Cutler fumbled on his own 38-yard line, but Ka'Deem Carey recovered the ball; the Bears would punt three plays later. Miami's eventual drive lasted into the second quarter, but ended with Caleb Sturgis missing a 50-yard field goal wide right. The Bears would reach the Dolphins' 37-yard line, but Cutler's pass for Martellus Bennett was intercepted by Reshad Jones, who returned the pick to the Bears' 29-yard line, and was stripped by Brandon Marshall, Koa Misi recovering at the 23-yard line. The fumble was subsequently challenged, but was upheld. Miami would drive to the Bears' eight-yard line, and two plays later, Tannehill threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace. Both teams would exchange punts at the end of the half, Miami leading 14-0. On their first drive of the second half, the Bears scored their first points of the game with Cutler's ten-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, though the Dolphins retaliated on their next possession with Lamar Miller's two-yard touchdown run. The Bears' drive lasted into the fourth quarter, but ended at their own 24-yard line when Wake strip-sacked Cutler, recovering it at Chicago's 16. The Dolphins would go three-and-out on the drive, resorting to Sturgis' 33-yard field goal. On the Bears' next drive, Cutler threw a pass to Dante Rosario, who fumbled after being stripped by Cortland Finnegan, Randy Starks recovering at the Bears' 35-yard line. However, the Dolphins failed to take advantage of the takeaway, Sturgis' 37-yard field goal being blocked by Lamarr Houston. Starting from their own 27, the Bears reached the Dolphins' 44, and a defensive pass interference penalty on Jason Taylor brought the Bears to the five-yard line. Three plays later, Forte scored on a one-yard run. The Dolphins would score on their next drive via Miller's four-yard run, but was nullified by holding penalty on Clay; Sturgis would kick a 19-yard field goal to make the score 27-14. Chicago's final drive reached Miami's 15-yard line, but the offense failed to gain ground, Cutler first throwing an incomplete pass, then fumbling but recovering, and finally throwing two more incomplete passes. Tannehill would kneel twice to end the game. The Bears fell to 0-4 in games where Cutler throws an interception. After the game, in the Bears' locker room, there were reports of shouting and players being pulled out of the room, with Marshall calling out Cutler, and Kyle Long criticizing the fans. Former Bears linebacker Blake Costanzo was also critical, stating Marc Trestman had \\"made the Bears soft\\". In an interview, Gould stated, \\"Everyone's trying to make this a story out of something that really wasn't that big of a deal. Obviously everyone's frustrated. Everyone wants to win.

The best answer among the provided options would be \\"diverse\\", and here's why: 1. Complicated — While the world might be complex in some aspects due to its various dimensions like political, economic, or social systems, complicated might not be the ideal choice to describe the essence of the world having many countries and continents. 2. Round — While the Earth is indeed round or more accurately, an oblate spheroid, this does not effectively capture the essence of the world as having various countries and continents. 3. Square — This option is incorrect as the Earth is not square-shaped. 4. Diverse — The world is diverse due to the myriad of cultures, languages, traditions, histories, and environments that can be found across the different countries and continents. This term best fits the context of the world having many types of people and locations. 5. Large — Although the world is indeed large, this term does not encapsulate the variety and richness of different countries and continents. \\"Diverse\\" is a better choice as it highlights the range of human experiences and geographies.

Would Kenya have less or more organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania?  In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. The answer to this question is:","output":"Kenya would have less organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said. Next class he moved from the seat at the edge of my peripheral vision, to the middle, started working his ass off, and he passed. For a while I thought he was closing in on a C, but he got his D and graduated. And I didn’t give him anymore of a grading break than I give any of my students.

Chrome includes no options to display a sidebar or status bar, or any other toolbar.\\" In this sentence, the author discusses different elements of a web browser's user interface. These elements are categorized into three primary sections: the address bar, the toolbar icons, and the tab bar. Let's explore each of these interface elements in detail. 1. Address Bar: The address bar is the text box at the top of a web browser window, typically used for entering website URLs or performing a search query. In many modern browsers like Google Chrome, the address bar also functions as a search bar, allowing users to type in keywords or phrases to quickly perform a search without having to navigate to a specific search engine website. 2. Toolbar Icons: These are the icons that typically appear on a browser's toolbar, which is the horizontal strip located either at the top or bottom of a browser window. Toolbar icons represent different functionalities and can be used to access features and settings within the browser. Some common toolbar icons include bookmarks, history, downloads, and settings. Users can also customize their toolbar by adding or removing icons that better suit their browsing needs. 3. Tab Bar: The tab bar is the horizontal strip near the top of a web browser window that displays a series of tabs, each representing a different open webpage. Tabs provide a means for users to easily switch between multiple web pages without having to open multiple browser windows. Some browsers, like Chrome, also allow users to group tabs together, making it easier to manage and navigate a large number of open tabs simultaneously. Interestingly, the author also points out that Google Chrome, a popular web browser, does not provide options to display other interface elements, such as a sidebar, a status bar, or any other additional toolbars. These features are present in some web browsers, and their functionalities are briefly described below. - Sidebar: A sidebar is a vertical panel that resides on one side of a browser window, usually the left side. It can be used to display various content, such as bookmarks, history, or other tools and features. Sidebars can be particularly useful for those who prefer an organized approach to browsing or utilizing browser features, as it provides quick access to commonly used tools.    - Status Bar: A status bar is a horizontal strip, often located at the bottom of a browser window, that displays information about the webpage being viewed or the progress of a page loading. Some browsers also allow extensions or add-ons to display content in the status bar, offering users additional information or features. - Additional Toolbars: Some browsers offer the option to add custom toolbars to their interface. These can be created by the user or installed through extensions or add-ons. Custom toolbars can be used to provide quick access to specific functionalities or features that a user frequently uses, tailoring the browsing experience to individual needs and preferences. In conclusion, the interface elements discussed in the sentence include the address bar, toolbar icons, and the tab bar, which are essential components of a web browser's user interface. While Google Chrome does not offer options for sidebars or status bars, other browsers may provide these additional elements to enhance and personalize the browsing experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a text based on \\"new york set to allow people to change gender on birth certificate\\" Text:","output":"Title: New York: Set to Empower Individuals with New Gender Change Policy on Birth Certificates Introduction: New York City is known for its progressiveness, open-mindedness, and being a frontrunner for change, constantly pushing the boundaries of conventional norms. The city that never sleeps has always been at the vanguard of social and political demonstrations, consistently voicing concerns for the rights and well-being of minorities. Keeping its tradition of being a leader in ensuring civil rights, New York is set to make another groundbreaking move, allowing people to change their gender on their birth certificates.  The New Paradigm Shift: In an unprecedented decision aimed at supporting the transgender and non-binary community, New York City officials have proposed legislation that will make it permissible for individuals to change their gender on their birth certificate without necessarily undergoing gender reassignment surgery. This development marks a crucial milestone for the transgender community as it removes the barriers posed by conventional methods, allowing people to assume an identity that aligns with their true selves.  The Road to Equality: The journey to achieving this milestone has been a long, arduous one. As with any civil rights movement, the battle for transgender rights and identity recognition has its roots in a series of protests, rallies, and well-organized movements led by activists and community members. This new legislation emphasizes the needs and rights of a community that has been largely marginalized, persecuted, and stigmatized. It is an opportunity to create new pathways that validate their existence and experiences.  The Ripple Effect: This move holds the potential to create a ripple effect across the United States. Other states may follow suit and take similar legislative steps to support the transgender and non-binary community. Such a response is paramount in ensuring a future that values equal rights regardless of one's gender identity. This decision emphasizes the importance of self-identification, acknowledging that every individual has the right to assert and affirm their gender identity without restriction. Support and Resources: Enabling people to change their gender on their birth certificate requires support from various quarters. It is essential for healthcare providers, educators, and social service agencies to be knowledgeable about this new legislation and how it impacts transgender people who seek these services. Healthcare professionals need to ensure there is adequate psychological, medical, and emotional support for those exploring the possibility of gender change, ensuring that they receive accurate information and best practices. Educators play a crucial role in fostering a nurturing environment that empowers individuals while promoting understanding among their peers. Critics and Challenges: Despite this progressive move, there are those who argue against the idea of allowing people to change their gender on their birth certificates, citing moral, religious, and political concerns. However, such opposition predominately stems from ignorance and misunderstanding. It is essential for the transgender and non-binary community to engage in dialogue and debunk these misconceptions to create an environment of understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity. Conclusion: New York City's decision to allow individuals to change their gender on their birth certificates is a monumental step in advancing transgender rights. It recognizes the importance of self-identification, paves the way for greater gender equality, and, most importantly, offers opportunities for transgender individuals to lead their lives true to their identities. This legislation serves as a testament to New York City's commitment to ensuring equal rights for all, regardless of gender identity. And as the city takes these strides, it provides a shining example of empathy, understanding, and inclusion for the rest of the nation to follow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The New York Yankees are known for their distinctive uniform, which has a white jersey with dark, navy blue pinstripes, so this detail aligns with the information provided. However, let's analyze the first statement to see if we can conclude its accuracy with the given information: \\"A baseball player in a white uniform with dark stripes is partially on the ground, poised to catch a ball in his left hand as the ball quickly approaches.\\" 1. \\"A baseball player in a white uniform with dark stripes\\": As mentioned earlier, the Yankees' uniform colors match this description. However, there is no information provided about the specific player or game situation, so we cannot definitively conclude that the player in question is in this particular uniform at the time of the proposed scene. 2. \\"partially on the ground\\": Being \\"partially on the ground\\" could indicate that the player is diving, sliding, or has fallen while attempting to catch the ball. Although baseball players often find themselves in these positions, we cannot conclude that this player is partially on the ground based solely on the fact that he plays for the New York Yankees. 3. \\"poised to catch a ball in his left hand\\": Since the player is described as attempting to catch a ball, we know he is either an outfielder or an infielder. However, without further information, we cannot conclude that this player, specifically, would be in a position to catch the ball with his left hand. 4. \\"as the ball quickly approaches\\": This detail suggests that the ball is still in the air and has not yet been caught or landed near the player. Although the baseball player in question is a member of the New York Yankees, we do not have enough information to determine if he would find himself in this specific situation on the field. In summary, while the uniform description correlates with the information provided about the player's team affiliation, we cannot definitively conclude that a New York Yankees baseball player is \\"partially on the ground, poised to catch a ball in his left hand as the ball quickly approaches.\\" Additional information about the specific game situation, player position, and details surrounding the play would be necessary to support the conclusion of this statement confidently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What are the places that people now go to exercise which was one of the places only Greeks were allowed in?\\"  Context: \\"Throughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native \\"barbarians\\" and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The places that people now go to exercise, which were once exclusive to Greeks in the Hellenistic world, are largely the remnants of ancient gymnasiums and other locations associated with physical fitness and Greek culture.  Gymnasiums in the Hellenistic period were not just venues for physical exercise, but also served as centers for education, cultural gatherings, and social events for the Greek elite. They played a critical role in the preservation and dissemination of Greek culture, offering spaces for various athletic, philosophical, and artistic pursuits. These gymnasiums were exclusive to Greeks, as a way to maintain their cultural identity and uphold the social hierarchy imposed on the native populations. Today, the concept of a gymnasium has evolved significantly, and the modern-day gym has become a popular destination for people from various cultural backgrounds to engage in physical exercise. This shift towards inclusiveness can be attributed to significant changes in societal attitudes, breaking down the barriers that once prevented non-Greeks from participating in these spaces. However, there are still a few places where traces of the ancient Greek gymnasium influence can be found. Some sites of ancient gymnasiums have been repurposed over time as public parks, sports complexes, or recreational areas, promoting physical activity within the communities while preserving the historical legacy of the ancient Greeks. Examples of these sites include: 1. The Ancient Agora of Athens (Greece): This site contains the remains of an ancient gymnasium known as the Palaestra, which dates back to the 4th century BCE. As a space for wrestling and other combat sports, the Palaestra was an integral part of the Athenian gymnasium complex. 2. Olympia (Greece): This archaeological site, once the location of the ancient Olympic Games, features the ruins of a gymnasium and a palaestra. Visitors to Olympia can still witness the remnants of these historic athletic venues while learning about their cultural significance. 3. Priene (Turkey): The ancient city of Priene, located in modern-day Turkey, was once a center of Hellenistic culture. The ruins of its gymnasium can still be seen today, including a large courtyard and a complex of baths. 4. Ephesus (Turkey): This ancient Greek city also contains the remains of a gymnasium and a palaestra. Today, Ephesus serves as an open-air museum, showcasing various historical artifacts and structures, including the gymnasium site. In conclusion, while the concept of exclusive gymnasiums for Greeks has long been abandoned, the influence of these ancient spaces can still be found in the ruins of historic sites like those mentioned above. These locations remind us of the cultural legacy and uniqueness of the Hellenistic period and its impact on our modern understanding of physical fitness and well-being. However, it is important to recognize that today's gyms and fitness centers have evolved as inclusive spaces, open to people of all backgrounds, breaking down the barriers that once perpetuated inequality and cultural division in the ancient world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select from: I. plant is taller.. II. roof is taller.. Complete the following sentence. The plant is stopping the sun from reaching the top of the roof because the","output":"The plant is stopping the sun from reaching the top of the roof because the plant is taller than the roof itself. This unusual situation occurs when the particular plant species or tree has an exceptionally rapid growth rate and has been allowed to grow unchecked for an extended period of time. The height of the plant creates an expansive canopy that effectively blocks the sunlight from reaching the roof's surface, leading to an overall reduction in the amount of sunlight the roof receives. Several factors may contribute to the plant exceeding the height of the roof. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Plant species: Certain plant species, such as bamboo or some species of eucalyptus, are known for their rapid growth and towering height. When left uncontrolled, these plants can quickly grow to overshadow nearby structures. 2. Soil quality: The richness of the soil can have a significant impact on a plant's growth rate. Nutrient-dense soil may encourage more rapid growth in certain species, leading to a taller and more robust plant. 3. Environmental conditions: The climate and weather conditions in the area may contribute to the plant's accelerated growth. Adequate rainfall, favorable temperatures, and extended sunlight hours can result in a more lush and taller plant. 4. Lack of maintenance: In some cases, property owners may be unaware of the plant's rapid growth or may not have the resources to maintain the plant's height. This absence of pruning and trimming allows the plant to continue growing unchecked, ultimately reaching heights that surpass the roof. The tall plant's ability to block sunlight from reaching the roof can have a range of consequences. For instance, the lack of sunlight can lead to a buildup of moss and algae on the roof, causing potential damage and shortening the roof's lifespan. Additionally, the shadow cast over the roof may create a cold and damp environment that affects the livability and energy efficiency of the building itself.  In order to remedy this situation, it is recommended that property owners either prune or trim the plant to a safe height, where it no longer obstructs sunlight from reaching the roof. Alternatively, they may consider removing the plant altogether and replacing it with a species that has a more manageable growth pattern. By addressing the issue, they can help maintain the integrity of the roof, enhance energy efficiency, and improve the overall appearance of the property."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement had only minor errors regarding capitalization, which are now corrected. Here is a breakdown of the sentence capitalization rules implemented in this statement: 1. \\"We do not recommend mixing Theta Nutrition formulas with anything other than water.\\" - The first letter of the first word in the sentence should be capitalized (\\"We\\"). \\"Theta Nutrition\\" refers to a specific nutrition brand or program, which are almost always capitalized, because they are proper nouns. Each specific word in the brand name \\"Theta Nutrition\\" begins with a capital letter. 2. \\"It's important to know that nutrients and amino acids compete with one another.\\" - Similarly, the first word of a sentence needs to be capitalized. \\"It's\\" is a contraction of \\"it is,\\" and according to English language rules, the \\"I\\" should be capitalized. Remember that capitalization is important for readability, clarity and professionalism, even if the message is informal. It helps to distinguish between different sentences, proper nouns and the beginning of new ideas.

Title: Blood Monkey Movie plot: Blood Monkey is a horror / jungle suspense thriller set in modern day Thailand. The film centers around anthropological professor Conrad Hamilton (F. Murray Abraham) attempting to study a new species of primate, possibly the missing link between humanity and the great ape, found in a hidden valley deep within the jungles of Thailand. The movie opens into action with Hamilton's initial research team trying to capture one of these new (and very large) primates, but fails and is apparently wiped out. Hamilton and his assistant Chenne (Prapimporn Karnchanda) survive and scour the camp site looking for clues and remains of their team. Meanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a motley crew of incredibly naive college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush. He drops them off in a panic at the edge of trail/road, which leads further still into the foliage, claiming \\"bad things\\" are in there and won't go any further. He high-tails it back the way he came, leaving the students to march forth into the unknown. They walk until they reach the end of trail and set up camp. As evening sets in, noises from the jungle raise suspicion until a set of glowing green eyes can be seen close by, watching. Just before the unknown creature attacks, Chenne arrives with a flare that scares off the unseen menace. Chenne escorts the students to the relative safety of Professor Hamilton's camp, and the following day they meet the obsessed man and learn of his mission and their purpose...sort of.

Do you know what a gang is? A gang is a group of people who come together and sometimes do bad things. There are a lot of gangs in New York City. In fact, people think there are more than 300 gangs! That's a lot, isn't it? Now, some of these gangs are very famous, like the Bloods and Crips. They have been around for a long time, but most gangs in New York City are small. These smaller gangs are like little teams, with only a few people in them. About 40% of the time when someone uses a gun in a bad way, it is done by these small gangs. One of these little teams is called the Very Crispy Gangsters. This gang has kids in it who are about the same age as your big brothers and sisters, from 12 to 20 years old. Now, sometimes people in gangs get mad at each other. This is called \\"disrespect.\\" It can happen when they see each other on the street or even online, where people talk and post pictures. This disrespect can lead to more bad things called violence. But did you know that New York City has had gangs for a very long time? Like even as far back as the 1800s! That's more than 100 years ago! Back then, there were gangsters too, and they were a lot different from the gangs we see today. A famous movie director named Martin Scorsese made a movie about these old-time gangsters called \\"Gangs of New York.\\"  So now you know that there are many gangs in New York City, and they can sometimes do bad things. It's important to remember to always be nice to others and treat them with respect, so we don't have to worry about gangs and violence. It's so much better when we all get along, don't you think?"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The vote in the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, came the same day as the ECHR ruled against Russia's Federal Security Service over spying. The European court said Russia had violated privacy rights with a system to secretly intercept mobile phone communications. The Russian constitution takes precedence under the new Duma law. The measure was fast-tracked, giving the constitutional court the right to declare international court orders unenforceable in Russia if they contradict the constitution. It specifically aims to \\"protect the interests of Russia\\" in the face of decisions by international bodies responsible for ruling on human rights, according to Tass news agency. Also on Friday, the ECHR ordered Russia to pay Roman Zakharov, editor-in-chief of a publishing company, €40,000 (£29,000) in expenses in a case over state spying. It agreed with Mr Zakharov that Russia's FSB security service had violated his rights to privacy by installing secret surveillance systems, and denying him the ability to resist potential monitoring. Russia ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1998, and is one of 47 member states in the Council of Europe, which monitors compliance with the convention. This year Russia contributed nearly €33m to the CoE's €306m budget. But Russia has often taken issue with rulings against it, including one by the ECHR last year ordering Moscow to pay more than 2bn (£1.3bn; €1.8bn) in compensation to shareholders in the defunct Russian oil firm, Yukos. In a separate development on Friday, Hungarian prosecutors said they had questioned a Hungarian MEP suspected of spying on EU institutions for Russia. Chief Prosecutor Imre Keresztes said Bela Kovacs, a member of Hungary's far-right Jobbik party, denied the spying allegations and made a case for his defence. The European Parliament lifted Mr Kovacs' immunity in October, which Jobbik said would help clear the MEP's name. Investigators have until 20 December to bring charges, according to reports.

The new law, which was fast-tracked, enables the constitutional court to declare international court orders unenforceable in Russia if they contradict the Russian constitution, protecting Russia's interests against decisions made by international human rights bodies.

Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers is William Bruce. He was a Scottish architect and an Episcopalian, who faced conflicts with his Protestant rulers during the reigns of James VII and William of Orange. He was imprisoned multiple times for refusing to appear before the Privy Council and for being considered a potential Jacobite threat. Despite these imprisonments, William Bruce continued his architectural work and pursued his interests in horticulture, music, and painting."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: I went to eat in a restaurant, but I left because the person at the front wasn't what?

Chabot scored a goal and an assist in a 6-3 victory over the Rangers on Saturday. It was Chabot's first multi-point game since Dec. 1. Since that time, he posted three goals and seven points in 31 games, so scoring is clearly not the 21-year-old's strength.

В его вопросе звучала некая озабоченность и любопытство относительно моего мнения об этом фундаментальном аспекте, который напрямую влияет на представление и развитие каждого народа и государства. Обсуждение национальной идеи открывает основные аспекты сущности и самобытности народа, его исторического опыта, преемственности традиций и ценностей. Важность этой идеи заключается в том, что она предлагает моменты сплочения и объединения нации вокруг общих идей, целей и представлений о будущем и настоящем. Более того, национальная идея имеет свои корни в глубоких культурных кодах и символах, а потому ее изучение и осмысление позволяет отслеживать насыщенный контекст и налаживать эффективный культурный диалог между разными поколениями. В данном контексте мой ответ студенту был направлен на то, чтобы подчеркнуть сложность и многогранность национальной идеи, ее преемственность и место в свете современных дискуссий. Я настаивал на важности эволюции и символического обновления национальной идеи с учетом глобализации, изменяющихся социальных и политических реалий, межкультурных контактов и опытов других народов. В конечном итоге, обсуждение национальной идеи нас сближает как сообщество, расширяет наши интеллектуальные горизонты и укрепляет нашу культурную и национальную самосознание.

Context: The Treaty of Sèvres was signed by the Ottoman Empire and was followed by the occupation of Artvin by Georgian forces on 25 July. The Treaty of Alexandropol  was the first treaty signed by the Turkish revolutionaries. It nullified the Armenian activities on the eastern border, which was reflected in the Treaty of Sèvres as a succession of regions named Wilsonian Armenia. The 10th item in the Treaty of Alexandropol stated that Armenia renounced the Treaty of Sèvres, which stipulated Wilsonian Armenia. After the peace agreement with the Turkish nationalists, in late November, a Soviet-backed Communist uprising took place in Armenia. On 28 November 1920, the 11th Red Army under the command of Anatoliy Gekker crossed over into Armenia from Soviet Azerbaijan. The second Soviet-Armenian war lasted only a week. After their defeat by the Turkish revolutionaries the Armenians were no longer a threat to the Nationalist cause. It is also possible to claim that had the ADR been content with the boundaries as of 1919, it could have shown more resistance to the Bolshevik conquest, both internally and externally, but that was not how things happened. On 16 March 1921, the Bolsheviks and Turkey signed a more comprehensive agreement, the Treaty of Kars, which involved representatives of Soviet Armenia, Soviet Azerbaijan, and Soviet Georgia. The arms left by the defeated ADR forces were sent to the west for use against the Greeks. Question: Which treaty came first the Treaty of Sevres or the Treaty of Alexandropol? Answer:","output":"The Treaty of Sèvres came first, signed on August 10, 1920, between the Ottoman Empire and the Allied Powers, including the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. It was aimed at the partition of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and addressed various territorial issues. However, the treaty was never ratified due to the rise of the Turkish War of Independence led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, which resulted in the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. The Treaty of Alexandropol was signed later on December 2-3, 1920, between the Turkish revolutionaries, represented by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, and the Democratic Republic of Armenia. This treaty nullified the provisions concerning Armenia in the Treaty of Sèvres and helped establish new borders between Armenia and Turkey. The Treaty of Alexandropol, however, was later superseded by the Treaty of Kars, signed on October 13, 1921, between Turkey and the Soviet Republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, which finalized the borders and political agreements in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Children aged 5 to 12 are advised to sleep 10 to 11 hours every night, but most of them can't sleep that long. A study found that about 41 million American workers got less than six hours of sleep every night. Scientists worry that parents are passing their bad sleeping habits down to their children. In the study, Reut Gruber and some other scientists either added or reduced on hour of sleep for healthy children aged 7 to 11. They watched the children for five nights. They wanted to know if the amount of sleep can affect a child's behavior. Before the study began, students were asked to sleep the same amount of hours as usual. Their teachers were asked to record their behavior. After five nights of the records, scientists found that those who slept one hour less behaved worse than those who slept one hour more. Students with less sleep were more likely to feel sad and had more problems paying attention. The scientists chose to study children in their homes instead of in a laboratory, because they wanted to find out how everyday changes might affect children's behavior at school. \\"In the study, nobody became a talent, and nobody became crazy.

Plot title: Bashu, the Little Stranger Movie plot: The film opens in the midst of an Iraqi air raid in the state of Khuzestan in Southern Iran. Beizaei films Bashu (Adan Afravian) caught between bombs exploding, a scene of a Muslim woman (his Mother) burning, and a young girl (his sister) running lost in the smoke. He needs to escape and so he jumps into the back of a truck heading North out of the war. From this point on Bashu enters another reality in a remote farming village Gilan near the Russian border where the people are lighter skinned and speak a different language. There Bashu meets Naii (Susan Taslimi) and her children. By accepting him into her family as one of her own children, Naii poses the fundamental question we hear from the film - \\"Aren't we all children of Iran?\\" From out of war torn trauma, Bashu finds hope and trust with Naii's family.Parallels are drawn throughout the film between Bashu and Naii as culturally repressed figures in Iran. Bashu is a dark-skinned, Arab speaking boy, which at the time defied the Persian nationalism thought to unify the country. And, Naii being an uneducated woman who could not read or write would normally not be able to manage on the farm without her husband. Yet, these differences are what bring Bashu and Naii to depend on each other for support and their own sense of family and belonging. This bond is seal at the end of the film when the husband returns with a missing arm and therefore becomes grateful and accepting of Bashus role as his son on the farm.Although Naii and Bashu are culturally repressed characters due to their gender and race, Beizaei lifts them up as strong and successful characters able to survive on their own, care for each other, and thus defy the racial and sexist stereotypes against them.

Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba is governed by a unicameral legislative assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, the head of the executive branch.

Jerry heads out to buy it while encountering Tom on the way, who also has something for Holmes. Jerry returns to Holmes' flat and hands him the paper or what was left of it after the chase. Reading a letter Tom had given to them for the night, Holmes and Watson decide to go to the Bruce Nigel Theatre where a performer named Red is seen. Holmes is told that she is being blackmailed and Holmes suggests who the perpetrator might be – Professor Moriarty. Holmes deduces that the Star of Punjab, a diamond that is light sensitive to the light of a solar eclipse which was to happen the following day, is to be stolen by the mastermind of the blackmail. At the Punjab Embassy, Spike and Tyke are assigned to guard the Star of Punjab. Spike begins to teach Tyke how to be a good dog guard, but the three cats from the previous night steal the diamond while an unfocused Spike is not looking. The three cats then leave a small button and retreat. They climb out through a hole in Red's home that leads to the tunnel and escape before Holmes, Tom and Jerry arrive. Upon arriving, Jerry tricks Tom into stepping into a broken board and the trio check the tunnel. Finding sawdust, they retreat after hearing Tyke sounding the alarm. Holmes and Watson leave to find the shop where the button came from, while Tom and Jerry are left to take Red to Holmes' flat.

(CNN) -- As one of the most anticipated games of 2011, \\"Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds\\" (Capcom) doesn't disappoint with new characters, a story line with uber-villain Galactus and a new mode designed to make it easy to get involved in the action. After a 10-year hiatus, the popular fighting game brings the battle zones into the third dimension. While action remains in two dimensions, the characters are generated in 3-D and provide for a more robust visual image of the fighting. Each fight can be one-on-one or tag-team, with three characters on each side. One of the biggest question marks as the game's release neared was who would be in and who would be left off of the Marvel and Capcom casts.  OPTIONS: - 3-D characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - CNN characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Capcom characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Galactus characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Marvel characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Marvel vs. Capcom characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Marvel vs. Capcom 3 characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Two Worlds characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers.","output":"Capcom characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. Explanation: The correct answer is the one that correctly separates and defines the characters from the two different franchises involved in the game. Capcom refers to the video game developer and its characters, whereas Marvel refers to the comic book company and its characters. Why other answers are wrong: 1. 3-D characters, Galactus characters, Marvel vs. Capcom characters, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 characters, and Two Worlds characters are not relevant descriptions and don't clearly differentiate between the characters from the two different franchises. 2. CNN characters are not relevant to the game and, as a news outlet, CNN doesn't have any characters to be included in the game. 3. Marvel characters are defined by their moves and powers sentence is self-contradictory since it uses \\"Marvel characters\\" in both sides of the sentence, making it non-sensical."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. Question: Which of the following is NOT TRUE?  _ Answer: Select from the following. (1).

Student:","output":"To solve this instance, I will first break down the comment into sentences to analyze each part and determine if it falls into the identity-attack or non-identity-attack category. 1. Kick all mex out. To H. with any of them. - This sentence shows disrespect towards Mexicans, which is targeting a specific ethnicity. Therefore, this falls under the identity-attack category. 2. They argue, jail and execute the works. - This sentence is vague and not directed at a specific group or identity, so I would classify it as non-identity-attack. 3. It's time the White Male sticks up for himself, family and country. - This sentence mentions a specific race and gender (White Male), although it doesn't necessarily attack other identities, it suggests that white males should stand up against other groups. I would consider this as identity-attack. 4. Enough of letting the coloreds kill, rape and plunder us. - This sentence targets a specific group (coloreds), generalizing them in a highly negative and disrespectful manner. Therefore, this falls under the identity-attack category. 5. You scream raceisim, I safe fair game. Turn about is fair play. - This sentence indicates that the commenter is defending their actions, which involve disrespecting other identities. While it does not directly attack an identity, it supports such actions, so I would also classify it as identity-attack. In conclusion, the comment contains several sentences that can be classified as identity-attack due to the disrespectful language and targeting of specific groups based on their race or ethnicity."},{"instruction":"Process:  - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.  suppose less coffee will be made happens, how will it affect MORE coffee being made.

The BBQ chef tried to put the grill fork in the drawer but it wouldn't fit; the","output":"drawer was too small and cluttered with other utensils, so he decided to find a more suitable place to store his grill fork. He began by carefully examining the kitchen, and realized that there were many potential storage solutions in the space. First, he considered hanging the grill fork on a wall-mounted utensil rack. This would provide easy access to the tool while also keeping it out of the way when not in use. However, the existing rack was already full of other essential cooking implements, leaving no available space for the long-tined fork. He knew he had to be more resourceful to find a solution for his storage problem. The chef then thought about utilizing the unused space above the cabinets in the kitchen. Although the area was a bit difficult to reach, it could accommodate larger tools such as the grill fork. Still, he hesitated to place it there, as the effort required to retrieve the fork each time he needed it might be inconvenient in the long run. Another idea that came to mind was repurposing a nearby empty vase as a storage container for his larger utensils. The vase was large enough to hold the grill fork and could also be used to store other bulky items like spatulas and tongs. This would not only solve his storage issue, but also give the vase a renewed purpose. However, the chef was still not fully satisfied with this solution, as he wanted the fork to be in a more practical and accessible spot. As he continued to contemplate on the matter, he realized that he had completely overlooked a magnetic strip on one of his cabinet doors, designed specifically for holding metal kitchen tools. He tested to see if the grill fork would be secure on the strip, and it held up effortlessly. Excited by this discovery, he rearranged some of the items on the magnetic strip to accommodate the grill fork. The chef finally felt contented with his found solution, as the grill fork was now easily accessible and stored safely away from potential hazards in the kitchen. He cleaned up the cluttered drawer that initially posed the problem, making a mental note to regularly organize his kitchen tools in the future. With the issue resolved, the BBQ chef could now focus on his culinary creations, knowing he had found an efficient and practical storage solution for his beloved grill fork."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies. Goldstein states that the government of Güshi Khan and the Dalai Lama persecuted the Karma Kagyu sect, confiscated their wealth and property, and even converted their monasteries into Gelug monasteries.
