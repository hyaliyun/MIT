CT angiography can detect blockages in the coronary arteries with high accuracy and can provide detailed images of the heart and its blood vessels. This technique is particularly useful for diagnosing CAD in patients with a high risk of complications. 4. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR): Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the heart and its blood vessels. CMR can detect early signs of CAD by measuring the thickness of the heart muscle, which can increase in response to blockages in the coronary arteries. CMR is also useful for evaluating the extent of CAD and determining the best course of treatment. Advantages and Limitations: Non-invasive diagnostic techniques for CAD have several advantages over invasive procedures, including: 1.

It was first introduced in the market in 1987 and has since become one of the most prescribed medications for depression and other mental health disorders. The chemical synthesis of fluoxetine involves several steps and has evolved over the years to improve its efficiency and yield. In this article, we will explore the synthetic routes of fluoxetine and its significance in the chemical industry. The first synthesis of fluoxetine was reported in 1974 by a team of chemists at Eli Lilly and Company, led by Bryan Molloy. The initial route involved the condensation of 3-phenyl-3-(4-piperidyl)propanal with 4-fluorobenzonitrile, followed by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride to yield the desired product, fluoxetine. However, this method had several limitations, including low yield and the use of toxic reagents. Therefore, further research was conducted to develop a more efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis of fluoxetine. The current synthetic route of fluoxetine involves a three-step process, starting from the commercially available starting material, 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-1-ol. The first step involves the conversion of this compound to 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-1-one through a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction using acetyl chloride and aluminum chloride. This intermediate is then reacted with 4-(4-fluorophenyl)piperidine in the presence of sodium hydride to form 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-N-methylpropan-1-amine. The final step in the synthesis of fluoxetine is the N-demethylation of the above intermediate using sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide to yield fluoxetine. This method has several advantages over the previous route, including higher yield, fewer steps, and the use of milder and safer reagents. Another significant improvement in the synthesis of fluoxetine was the development of a chiral synthesis route. The original synthesis produced a racemic mixture of fluoxetine, which means it contained equal amounts of both enantiomers (mirror images) of the molecule. However, it was later discovered that the S-enantiomer of fluoxetine was responsible for its therapeutic effects, while the R-enantiomer had no significant activity. Therefore, a chiral synthesis route was developed to produce pure S-fluoxetine, which is more potent and has fewer side effects. The chiral synthesis of fluoxetine involves the use of a chiral auxiliary, (S)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine, in the first step of the synthesis. This auxiliary helps to control the stereochemistry of the molecule, resulting in the production of only the S-enantiomer.
