This situation generally happens when the conversion between screen points to world points is not correctly handled, or when there's a misunderstanding in the setup of the ray's start and end points, especially in a 2D game context using an orthographic camera setup. Given that the core issue revolves around the transition from screen space to world space and ensuring the ray has a nonzero length, let's further simplify and correct our approach. Since providing a solution that accurately maps to your game setup without more context (like the camera used, game setup, etc.) is challenging, my previous responses might have missed target details pertinent to your scenario. To effectively address the issue and eliminate the \\"Ray had 0 length\\" warning, let's focus on ensuring there's a clear distinction between the \`from\` and \`to\` vectors in the Z-axis direction, as the Z-axis distinction is critical for a successful raycast in a 2D setup. However, without specific details on your camera setup or how you're managing world space coordinates, let's consider a basic principle that can help: When working in a 2D world (especially with an orthographic camera), ensure your \`from\` and \`to\` points extend along the Z-axis to cover the depth of the objects in your game world. This assumption is crucial for the ray to intersect with objects. # General Corrective Steps 1. **Verify Camera Setup**: Ensure your camera setup (whether it's a custom camera or a framework-specific solution) is correctly translating screen coordinates to world coordinates. This step is crucial because a misunderstanding or misconfiguration here can lead to the mentioned issue. 2. **Ensure Non-Zero Ray Length**: You must guarantee the ray has a non-zero length, particularly along the Z-axis, as Defold's physics engine reports an error for zero-length rays. # Simplified Raycast Example Below is a simplified example, assuming an orthographic projection where objects are placed within a certain range of the Z-axis: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Assuming an orthographic projection, extending the ray along the Z-axis local from = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, -1) -- Start just in front of the near plane local to = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 1) -- End just behind the far plane -- Perform the raycast local result = physics.raycast(from, to, {hash(\\"default\\")}) if result and result.id == go.get_id() then print(\\"Game object clicked.\\") end end end \`\`\` # Note: - The example above presumes an orthographic projection where the game world is primarily on the XY plane, and objects have some presence along the Z-axis within the [-1, 1] range. - Make sure your game objects are properly configured with collision objects and are set to the correct collision group that matches the one specified in the \`raycast()\` call. If issues persist, it might be helpful to revisit your game's camera setup or how you're managing the conversion from screen to world coordinates, especially considering the Z-axis depth of your game objects."},{"instruction":"dont work","output":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. Without a specific camera setup or knowing the exact dimensionality of your game (2D vs. 3D), it can be challenging to provide a precise solution. However, if you're facing issues with ray length or coordinate conversion, here's a new approach assuming you're working within a 2D game environment in Defold, and aiming to interact with objects through clicking or tapping without explicit screen-to-world coordinate conversions. # Basic Click Detection within a 2D Game If the previous solutions did not work and assuming a simpler scenario where you want to detect clicks/taps on objects within a 2D environment without worrying about depth (Z-axis), you can consider an alternative strategy. This involves using collision objects as sensors and detecting pointer inputs within their bounds, sidestepping the direct use of raycasting which can be problematic if the camera or world space conversions are not accurately handled. Here’s a simplified setup: 1. **Ensure your game object has a collision object:** This collision object should be set up as a trigger (sensor) with the correct collision group and mask settings. Place it around or as part of the game object you wish to be clickable. 2. **Use the input and collision messages:** Instead of calculating raycasts, listen for input and check if the collision object was hit by utilizing the \`action_id\` and \`action\` in the \`on_input\` function. \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Request input focus self.clickable = true -- State to control when the object can be clicked end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") -- Clean up end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if self.clickable and action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Since raycasting isn't effectively working, this part is commented out -- Instead, rely on collision object setup as sensor -- Broadcast a message to check for collisions with the point msg.post(\\"#collisionobject\\", \\"trigger_response\\", {position = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 0)}) end end -- Assuming you set up a collision object to send messages when triggered function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender) if message_id == hash(\\"contact_point_response\\") then -- Handle click based on the collision detected print(\\"Game object touched / clicked\\") end end \`\`\` # Important to Note: - This method requires your project to correctly handle messages sent by collision objects. You might need to tailor it to how your specific Defold project is set up, especially in how collision objects and their messages are managed. - The \`collisionobject\` component should be correctly set up to detect pointer interactions. This means ensuring it is marked as a sensor (trigger) and that it listens for the appropriate input actions. - Adjust the message handling (\`on_message\`) based on your exact project setup and how you've defined message protocols among game objects. This approach is a simplification and reorientation towards using collision detection for clickable areas in a 2D game, stepping away from the complications of raycasting and manual coordinate conversions that might not have aligned with your project setup."},{"instruction":"first 2d script. 12: Field other_id not specified in table","output":"I see where the misunderstanding occurred. My intention was to outline an approach that involves using collision detection alongside input handling for a scenario where a direct raycast strategy wasn't suitable due to the complications or limitations experienced. However, based on your feedback, it seems the explanation ventured into an incorrect implementation by suggesting you send a \\"trigger_response\\" message to a collision object – this is not a standard message in Defold's physics or input handling system. Let's correct the course by providing a more standard approach to detecting clicks on objects in a 2D Defold game without using physics raycasts. This method relies on utilizing the collision object in Defold as a trigger zone and handling \\"touch\\" or \\"click\\" events through the input system correctly. To achieve this, ensure your game object has a collision object component attached and properly set up to act as a trigger. The collision object should be in a layer that interacts with a ray cast from the script, and ideally, you would use a physics ray cast. However, it seems we are avoiding this due to complexity or issues in implementation. Given your feedback, it appears my attempt to simplify might have led to confusion. Let’s not complicate with inaccurate methods but rather clarify the correct standard Defold way without introducing a misunderstood message handling. # Standard 2D Object Click Detection For a straightforward 2D object click detection without the previous complications: 1. **Ensure Your Game Object Has a Collision Object:** This should be in the \\"trigger\\" type group your script will listen for. 2. **Set Up Correct Mouse or Touch Input Handling:** Use the built-in \`on_input\` to handle this based on your game's configuration. Below is a basic example of handling touch/click on a game object with a collision object component: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Acquire input focus to receive inputs end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Prepare a physics ray cast to detect if we hit the collision object local from = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, -1) local to = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 1) physics.raycast(from, to, {\\"default\\"}) -- Assuming the collision object is in \\"default\\" group end end function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender) if message_id == hash(\\"ray_cast_response\\") then if message.request_id == hash(\\"my_request_id\\") and message.group == hash(\\"default\\") then -- Assuming you might have multiple raycasts, you should use a request_id to differentiate if message.normal ~= vmath.vector3(0, 0, 0) then -- This condition checks if the ray actually hit something print(\\"Object clicked\\") end end end end \`\`\` # Key Notes: - This script assumes you have set up the input correctly to generate \`touch\` actions in your game.project file. - Your collision object should be correctly configured in the editor to interact with the ray (in the \\"default\\" group, as assumed by the \`physics.raycast\` call arguments). - The \`on_message\` function should handle the \`ray_cast_response\` to determine if the game object was clicked. The conditional check with \`message.normal\` serves as an example to verify a successful hit; in practical use, you'd tailor response handling as needed. - Remember to replace \`\\"my_request_id\\"\` and action groups as per your specific game setup. I hope this corrects the previous attempt and provides a clearer path forward.

If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think A 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself . . . A Little Planning Goes a Long Way If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.” From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.

The following is excerpted from an article written by a leadership professional. When you attend a networking event, cocktail party, or meet someone for a business lunch, exchanging superficial small talk is par for the course. Sure, questions like What do you do? and Where do you live? are almost necessary to get some conversational momentum. But how many of us are willing to go deeper? How many of us can say we are adept at drawing someone into a meaningful conversation that may lead to mutual benefit? As science discovered, the exchange of the often-rare meaningful interaction in social or business settings can be the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Kiss the small talk goodbye, says science As published in Psychological Science, researchers found that the happiest participants in a study involving more than 20,000 recorded conversations had twice as many genuine and deep talks as the unhappiest participants. This confirms what most people know: Surface-level small talk does not build relationships. Behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested the theory by hosting a dinner party where small talk was literally banned. To set some parameters for good conversations, they provided big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters. Instead of decreasing freedom, “people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about,” state the authors. In turn, “everyone was happier.” Entrepreneurs and leaders of every persuasion have seized on the opportunity to socially engage with captivating questions posed at “Jefferson”-style dinners across the country. Try Jeffersonian dinners Jennifer McCrea, senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, co-authored a book about Jeffersonian dinners called The Generosity Network. “We were kind of tired of traditional galas and standing cocktail parties where people were making small talk and then would get pitched to by an organization—and nothing would come out of them,” McCrea explains. “The genesis is that Thomas Jefferson himself apparently would do dinners like this at his home and bring in very important people.” Such events, whether attracting big wigs or neighbors, open up all kinds of possibilities for introverts. Barry Breaux, a Bay Area physician, hosts such gatherings with simple rules of engagement, including: ● No small talk once discussion starts; no side conversations. ● Confidentiality is a must—respect the privacy of personal stories and information that may be shared. ● If you disagree with something, attack ideas, not people.

The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017. Fine Art America, fineartamerica.com/featured/ small-talk-vortex-sofia-warren.html. The following is a cartoon that appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 2017. Sofia Warren/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank","output":"Small talk is a pervasive and multifaceted element of human interaction that garners mixed feelings from individuals across various contexts—from the workplace to social gatherings. Despite its seemingly trivial nature, the role of small talk in fostering interpersonal relationships, facilitating professional growth, and contributing to our overall well-being cannot be overlooked. Synthesizing insights from Source A (Mannering), Source B (Schwantes), and Source D (Holmes), this essay argues that small talk serves as a fundamental building block in both personal and professional realms, enhancing social cohesion and opening doors to deeper, more meaningful interactions. Source A (Mannering) highlights the instrumental role that small talk plays in the workplace, suggesting that engaging in casual conversations with colleagues can lead to tangible professional benefits. The article underscores how small talk builds rapport and trust among team members, which are crucial for a harmonious work environment and can significantly influence career progression opportunities, such as promotions (Mannering). This demonstrates that small talk, despite its casual nature, carries weight in professional settings by fostering a culture of camaraderie and mutual respect. Thus, embracing small talk can be seen not merely as a social nicety but as a strategic career move. Source B (Schwantes) expands on the notion of small talk by contrasting it with deeper, more meaningful conversations. While advocating for the value of engaging conversations, Schwantes acknowledges the role of small talk as the gateway to more significant interactions. The article draws on research to argue that meaningful interactions, which often begin with small talk, are correlated with greater happiness. Additionally, the concept of Jeffersonian dinners illustrates how structured conversations can lead to enriching experiences, suggesting that the transition from small talk to substantial discussions can yield mutual benefits in both personal and professional contexts (Schwantes). Thus, small talk is not merely a superficial exchange but a stepping stone to exploring topics of shared interest that can enhance relationships and emotional well-being. Source D (Holmes) provides a nuanced understanding of small talk within the workplace through the concept of 'doing collegiality,' highlighting how such exchanges serve to affirm positive social relationships among colleagues. Holmes’s analysis reveals that small talk conveys mutual goodwill and acknowledges shared challenges, thereby acting as a social lubricant that facilitates smoother interactions and teamwork (Holmes). This perspective reinforces the notion that small talk is an essential component of a functional work environment, promoting a sense of belonging and shared purpose among employees. In synthesizing these sources, it becomes evident that small talk plays a crucial role in our everyday lives by laying the groundwork for deeper connections and fostering a sense of community in both personal and professional settings. Small talk acts as a bridge to more significant conversations, enabling individuals to navigate social landscapes with greater ease and confidence. While the depth and complexity of human interactions extend far beyond the initial chit-chat, acknowledging the value of these preliminary exchanges is vital for developing meaningful connections and advancing personal and professional goals. Therefore, small talk should be recognized and embraced for its role in facilitating social cohesion, enhancing professional relationships, and contributing to our overall sense of well-being. By appreciating the subtleties and potential of small talk, individuals can harness its power to forge stronger connections and enrich their social and professional lives."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\"","output":"\\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\""},{"instruction":"Can you write a pine script for tradingview that combines Twin Range Filter indicator and SALMA indicator?

The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017. Fine Art America, fineartamerica.com/featured/ small-talk-vortex-sofia-warren.html. The following is a cartoon that appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 2017. Sofia Warren/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank","output":"Small talk, often seen as a mundane and superficial form of communication, holds a pivotal role in shaping interpersonal connections and professional opportunities. Through synthesizing the arguments from Sources A, D, and E, this essay will argue for the essential role of small talk in everyday lives, highlighting its significance in building rapport, facilitating collegiality, and overcoming personal discomfort for larger social integration. Source A, by Mannering, shines a light on the underestimated value of small talk in professional settings. Mannering suggests that small talk is not merely trivial banter but a foundational element in building rapport among colleagues and superiors. This rapport, achieved through seemingly insignificant exchanges, is central to professional success, indirectly influencing career advancements such as promotions (Mannering). Through Mannering's insight, the reader can appreciate small talk as a strategic tool for navigation and advancement within the workplace, fostering an environment of mutual trust and understanding. This perspective encourages recognizing small talk not as a distraction but as an investment in one's professional relationships and growth. Expanding on the utility of small talk, Source D, by Holmes, delves into the concept of \\"doing collegiality.\\" According to Holmes, small talk serves as the lubricant for smooth interpersonal interactions within the workplace, and it is crucial for maintaining positive relationships. Holmes presents small talk as an activity that satisfies the positive face needs of individuals, helping to establish a sense of mutual regard and respect among colleagues (Holmes). This ensures a harmonious work environment where people feel connected and valued. Holmes's analysis underscores the role of small talk in creating and maintaining a supportive community at work, demonstrating its importance in not just professional but also social domains. Contrasting these views with Source E, where Roberts shares a personal disdain for small talk, we encounter a different yet enlightening perspective. Roberts's account of finding small talk excruciating and a trigger for fight-or-flight reactions illustrates the challenges some individuals face with this form of interaction. Despite the difficulties, Roberts acknowledges the necessity of engaging in small talk as a gateway to more substantial conversations and relationships (Roberts). This personal narrative elucidates the internal conflicts that accompany small talk for some, while simultaneously recognizing its indispensable role in forging connections. Synthesizing these sources, the importance of small talk emerges not only as a facilitator of professional relationships and a tool for career progression but also as a critical social skill that, despite its challenges, serves as a bridge to deeper interactions and understandings. The complexity of small talk, as highlighted in the sources, invites a nuanced view of its role in our lives. It urges an acknowledgment of its potential discomfort while advocating for its practice and appreciation as a fundamental aspect of human social interaction. In essence, small talk is a cornerstone of social and professional development, whose benefits far outweigh the perceived superficiality, making it an indispensable part of everyday life."},{"instruction":"median stone weight for c2 clearstone for filter layer breakwater","output":"The median stone size, often specified as (D_{50}), for a filter layer in breakwater construction, including filter layers for C2 clearstone, depends on the design criteria of the specific breakwater project. The (D_{50}) value represents the median diameter of the stone, where 50% of the material by weight is smaller and 50% is larger. It is a crucial parameter in ensuring the stability and permeability of the structure, especially in the context of withstanding wave action and preventing the erosion of finer materials from behind or beneath the breakwater. For a C2 clearstone or any specific aggregate used in breakwaters, the (D_{50}) or median stone size is usually determined by engineering analysis, considering: 1. **Wave conditions**: The intensity and height of waves the breakwater needs to withstand. 2. **Underlying soil characteristics**: The properties of the seabed or foundation soil can influence the choice of stone size. 3. **Permeability requirements**: Ensuring that the filter layer allows for adequate water drainage to reduce hydrostatic pressure and prevent undermining. 4. **Compatibility with other layers**: The size should be compatible with adjacent layers to prevent the washing away of finer materials and ensure the stability of the structure. In general, median stone sizes for breakwater filter layers can vary widely. For C2 clearstone and similar materials, median sizes might commonly range from 100 mm to 500 mm (about 4 to 20 inches) depending on the specific engineering requirements. However, these values can significantly differ based on the factors mentioned above. For accurate values, referring to the project's specific design documents or standards recommended by institutions such as the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Coastal Engineering Manual, or relevant local engineering regulations is necessary. Consulting with a coastal or civil engineer is also advisable to obtain recommendations tailored to the particular needs of a project."},{"instruction":"weight not diameter","output":"When discussing the median stone weight rather than the median stone size (diameter), for specific applications like a C2 clearstone filter layer in breakwater construction, it's important to understand that the industry often defaults to size specifications because of the direct relationship between stone size and its functionality in engineering applications. Stone weight directly correlates with its size, but specifications and designs are often expressed in terms of diameter or size classifications. However, if the focus is on the median weight of the stones for such applications, there isn't a straightforward, universally applicable answer, given the variability in density among types of stone. For instance, granite, limestone, and basalt will have different weights for the same volume due to their differing densities. To provide a touch of perspective, let's use a rough calculation for an approximation. Assume we're discussing granite, which has an average density of about 2.75 g/cm³ (grams per cubic centimeter). 1. Firstly, we note a common diameter range for filter layer stones might be from 100 to 500 mm. To discuss the weight, we assume a median size within a common range — say, a 300 mm diameter stone (noting that in practice, design specifications focus on ranges rather than specific sizes). 2. The volume of a spherical stone with a diameter of 300 mm (0.3 m) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere: [ V = frac{4}{3} pi r^3 ] Given (r = 0.15 m), [ V = frac{4}{3} pi (0.15 m)^3 approx 0.0141 m^3 ] 3. With granite's density at roughly 2.75 g/cm³ (or 2750 kg/m³ to work with our volume in cubic meters), the weight (mass, more accurately) of such a stone would be around: [ M = V times text{density} = 0.0141 m^3 times 2750 kg/m^3 = 38.775 kg ] This provides a generic sense of the weight for a singular median-sized stone in such applications. Of course, in practical engineering specifications and calculations, a range of sizes (and thus weights) will be considered to ensure appropriate grading and functionality of the filter layer. The specific stone material's density is crucial for calculating actual weights. It's also important to underline that the real-world application involves a distribution of stone sizes (and thus a distribution of weights), with the (D_{50}) value representing the median size around which this distribution centers. The actual design will require detailed engineering analysis, including considerations of material availability, cost, and the specific engineering properties needed for the breakwater's successful performance. For precise weight specifications for a project, consultation with a civil or coastal engineer and adherence to relevant construction standards and guidelines is necessary."},{"instruction":"round to nearest 0.5 tonne","output":"Based on the previous calculation, we found the weight of a granite stone with a diameter of 300 mm (or a median size stone for such applications) to be approximately 38.775 kg. To round this to the nearest 0.5 tonne, we first convert the weight into tonnes. There are 1,000 kilograms in a tonne, so: [ 38.775 , text{kg} = 0.038775 , text{tonnes} ] When rounding to the nearest 0.5 tonne, the closest values would be 0 tonnes or 0.5 tonnes. Since 0.038775 tonnes is closer to 0 than to 0.5, it would be rounded to: [ 0 , text{tonnes} ] However, this calculation demonstrates the weight of an individual stone, which might have led to confusion regarding the scale or the nature of your question. If you're considering aggregate or larger quantities of material typically used in construction like a breakwater filter layer, then the context would shift to discussing tonnes of material, not individual stones. For practical applications such as ordering clearstone for a filter layer, construction engineers and project managers will think in terms of cubic meters of material or tonnes as a bulk order, not individual stone weight. The grading and specification sheets will provide guidance on the appropriate size (diameter) and weight ranges for the stones in aggregate form to meet the project's needs. For any significant construction or landscaping project requiring clearstone or similar materials, the material will indeed be considered and purchased by the tonne or cubic meter, with the understanding that a range of stone sizes will be necessary to meet engineering specifications for permeability, stability, and durability."},{"instruction":"привет у меня такая ошибка InvalidCastException: Specified cast is not valid.

You must correctly handle input, map the click position from screen coordinates to world coordinates (adjusting for different resolutions), and then check if the click intersects with a collision object. Here's a simple example demonstrating how this can be achieved: First, ensure your project is set up to handle input. Open your game.project file and make sure you have a game.input_bindings file linked under the input section. In the input file, add a mouse trigger for the \\"touch\\" or \\"click\\" action. Here’s how you can do this graphically in Defold: 1. Open \`game.input_binding\` in Defold. 2. Under “mouse,” add an input with the action name (e.g., “click”) and select “MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT” as key with “Pressed” as the modifier. Next, setting up a script to handle click actions on a game object with a collision component: 1. **Create a Script**: Attach a script component to the game object that you want to be clickable. 2. **Implement Resolution-Independent Click Detection**: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Make sure the game object listens for inputs self.screen_width = tonumber(sys.get_config(\\"display.width\\")) -- Get configured screen width self.screen_height = tonumber(sys.get_config(\\"display.height\\")) -- Get configured screen height end local function screen_to_world(screen_x, screen_y, screen_width, screen_height) -- Convert from screen to world coordinates, assuming your game uses a fixed projection setup local camera = camera.get_position() -- Assuming you have a script to get the current camera position local w = render.get_width() local h = render.get_height() local world_x = (screen_x / screen_width) * w + camera.x local world_y = (screen_y / screen_height) * h + camera.y return world_x, world_y end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"click\\") and action.pressed then local world_x, world_y = screen_to_world(action.x, action.y, self.screen_width, self.screen_height) local result = physics.raycast(world_x, world_y, world_x, world_y + 1) -- Simple vertical raycast if result ~= nil then for _, hit in pairs(result) do if hit.id == go.get_id() then -- Check if we hit our game object print(\\"Clicked on game object!\\") -- Handle click logic here break end end end end end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") -- Cleanup end \`\`\` A few key points to understand in this code: - \`screen_to_world\` function converts screen coordinates to world coordinates. You need to ensure this conversion correctly maps to your game's camera setup. This example assumes a basic transformation that might need adjustments based on your game's camera logic. - The \`on_input\` function listens for click actions, converts the click position, and performs a raycast in the world to detect collisions. You might need to adjust the raycast direction and length based on your game's needs. - \`physics.raycast\` is a simple way to detect if a click intercepts any physics objects. Adjust the raycast to match your game object's specifics. This example makes several assumptions about your project setup (e.g., camera handling, project configuration). You'll need to adapt the details to fit your game's specific requirements, such as how you've set up your camera and rendering scripts."},{"instruction":"are you sure it's runtime resolution independent?","output":"The approach provided in the initial example aims to be resolution independent by dynamically using the screen's configured width and height to adjust the click's screen coordinates to world coordinates. However, to ensure true runtime resolution independence – especially as resolutions can change dynamically in some environments or setups – further adjustments might be necessary to adapt to any resolution changes that can occur after the game has started, and to handle different aspect ratios gracefully. For a more robust solution, consider these additional strategies: # 1. Dynamically Handling Resolution Changes: You can listen for window resize events and update your screen width and height variables accordingly. Defold doesn't directly send events for window resizes, but you can detect changes in resolution by comparing the current width and height with the previous ones during each frame in the \`update\` function. When a change is detected, update your variables and any necessary logic to adjust to the new resolution. # 2. Adjusting for Aspect Ratios: Handling different aspect ratios without stretching or squishing requires some consideration in how you present your game's world. You might need to adjust the camera setup to ensure that the game scales correctly and maintains its aspect ratio across different resolutions. # 3. Updated Example with Aspect Ratio Consideration: A detailed implementation covering every aspect of aspect ratio management and dynamic resolution changes would be comprehensive. Still, here's an adjusted focus on making the transformation from screen to world coordinates more flexible: \`\`\`lua local function update_screen_to_world_factors(self) local current_width = render.get_window_width() local current_height = render.get_window_height() local camera = camera.get_position() -- Ensure you have a mechanism to fetch current camera position self.scale_x = (camera.width / current_width) self.scale_y = (camera.height / current_height) end function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Initialization for your screen width and height variables update_screen_to_world_factors(self) end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"click\\") and action.pressed then -- Make sure variables are updated in case window size changes update_screen_to_world_factors(self) local world_x = action.x * self.scale_x local world_y = action.y * self.scale_y -- Use world_x and world_y for your raycast logic end end function update(self, dt) -- Consider detecting resolution change here if necessary end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") end \`\`\` In this revised example, \`update_screen_to_world_factors\` function is introduced to dynamically adjust the mapping from screen to world coordinates based on the current window size and the camera’s visible area (\`camera.width\` and \`camera.height\` must be set based on your game’s camera logic). This helps maintain consistency in how clicks are interpreted in the game world, regardless of the display resolution. # Conclusion: To ensure your game is truly resolution independent, especially during runtime, it’s important to dynamically adjust to resolution changes and consider aspect ratios in your game world presentation. The strategies and code samples here serve as a foundation, which you need to adapt based on your specific game setup, camera configuration, and how you handle different aspect ratios in your game world."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a kids coloring pages within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","output":"\\"Enchanted Blossom | Ultra-Realistic Fashion-Inspired Coloring Pages for Kids | Woman with Voluminous Sleeves & Flower Bouquet\\""},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Enchanted Blossom | Ultra-Realistic Fashion-Inspired Coloring Pages for Kids | Woman with Voluminous Sleeves &amp; Flower Bouquet.

Add this function to a Lua module (e.g., \`input_helper.lua\`) or directly in your script: \`\`\`lua -- input_helper.lua local M = {} function M.adjust_touch(touch, screen_width, screen_height) -- Assuming the game is set up to use a fixed aspect ratio with letterboxing -- Adjust touch coordinates based on actual screen size vs. expected design resolution local design_width = 1280 -- Change this to your design resolution width local design_height = 720 -- Change this to your design resolution height local scale_factor = math.min(screen_width / design_width, screen_height / design_height) local adjusted_x = (touch.x - (screen_width - (design_width * scale_factor)) * 0.5) / scale_factor local adjusted_y = (touch.y - (screen_height - (design_height * scale_factor)) * 0.5) / scale_factor return vmath.vector3(adjusted_x, adjusted_y, 0) end return M \`\`\` This function takes the touch or click position and adjusts it according to the game's designed resolution and the actual screen size, returning a vector3 with the adjusted position. # 2. Handling the Click Detection In the script attached to your clickable game object, you will check if the adjusted touch position intersects with the game object's collision shape upon touch or click. First, ensure your game object has a collision component set to \\"trigger\\" mode (otherwise, it will physically interact with other objects). Then, add this script to your clickable game object: \`\`\`lua local input_helper = require \\"input_helper\\" -- Adjust the path according to your project structure function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Make sure the object listens for input end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") -- Clean up end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Assuming \\"touch\\" is your input action for clicks/taps. local adjusted_touch = input_helper.adjust_touch(action, sys.get_config(\\"display.width\\"), sys.get_config(\\"display.height\\")) if physics.raycast(adjusted_touch, adjusted_touch) then local hit_results = physics.raycast(adjusted_touch, adjusted_touch) for i, result in ipairs(hit_results) do if result.id == go.get_id() then print(\\"Clicked on object!\\") -- Implement your click logic here break end end end end end \`\`\` # Note - This example uses a raycast at the touch position to detect collisions. This works well for simple cases and assumes your clickable objects aren't overlapping too much. For more complex shapes or situations, you may need a more sophisticated approach. - Ensure your \`game.project\` file has an appropriate input binding set up for \`\\"touch\\"\`. - Adapt the logic inside \`on_input\` as needed for your game, such as handling other types of gameplay input or performing different actions when a collision is detected. # Conclusion This basic setup demonstrates how to handle resolution-independent touch or click detection in Defold. Adjust and extend these code snippets based on your specific game design and requirements. Remember, Defold is a versatile engine, and there are often multiple ways to achieve your goals."},{"instruction":"i have historical data of crypto currencies as csv files (340 file) i want to train a TCN model on my data whithout merging them give me proper python code","output":"Training a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) using historical data from multiple files involves reading these files individually into a cohesive structure your model can understand, without actually merging the files. The TCN model can then be trained on this data. For this example, I'll assume your CSV files have a similar structure (e.g., columns for date, open, high, low, close, volume for each cryptocurrency), and you're interested in predicting future prices (or another similar task). Before starting, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, particularly TensorFlow (for building the TCN model) and pandas (for data manipulation). If you do not have these installed, you can do so by running: \`\`\`bash pip install tensorflow pandas \`\`\` Also, for the TCN model, we'll use the \`keras-tcn\` package for simplicity, which can also be installed via pip: \`\`\`bash pip install keras-tcn \`\`\` Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. **Import Libraries**: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense from tcn import TCN from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam import os \`\`\` 2. **Load and Preprocess Data**: I'll define a function to load data from individual CSVs, assuming they're all in a single directory, preprocess them (e.g., normalization), and prepare input-output pairs for training. Ensure your data is in the same structure or adjust this function accordingly. \`\`\`python def load_and_preprocess_data(directory): scaler = MinMaxScaler() X, y = [], [] # Inputs and outputs for file in os.listdir(directory): df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(directory, file)) # Assuming 'close' is what you want to predict; adjust as necessary. # Here, we're simply predicting the next close value based on past values. values = df['close'].values.reshape(-1, 1) values_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(values) # Prepare sequences; let's say we use a history of 10 days to predict the next day seq_length = 10 for i in range(len(values_scaled) - seq_length): X.append(values_scaled[i:i+seq_length]) y.append(values_scaled[i+seq_length]) return np.array(X), np.array(y) \`\`\` 3. **Model Creation**: Now, let's create a function to build our TCN model. \`\`\`python def create_tcn_model(input_shape): model = Sequential([ TCN(input_shape=input_shape, nb_filters=64, kernel_size=6, nb_stacks=1, dilations=[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]), Dense(1) ]) model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.002), loss='mean_squared_error') return model \`\`\` 4. **Loading Dataset & Model Training**: This step assumes your CSV files are in a directory named 'crypto_data'.

These cartoons, ranging from avant-garde experiments to hidden classics of the genre, offer diverse narratives, distinctive art styles, and unconventional storytelling that have either cultivated a niche following or have been overshadowed by more mainstream successes. Let's dive into a few of these lesser-known animated series and films that deserve a spotlight: # 1. **The Mysterious Cities of Gold (1982-1983)** Semi-obscure to some audiences but cherished by others, \\"The Mysterious Cities of Gold\\" is a French-Japanese animated series that combines history, adventure, and science fiction. Set in the 16th century, it follows a group of children searching for the legendary Cities of Gold in the New World. Its unique blend of real historical settings with fantasy and advanced ancient technology captivated viewers across the globe, yet it didn’t achieve the same level of lasting mainstream fame as other cartoons from its era. # 2. **The Secret of NIMH (1982)** While Don Bluth's \\"The Secret of NIMH\\" might not be considered obscure to animation enthusiasts, it remains a somewhat semi-obscure title in the wider public consciousness. This animated film, based on Robert C. O'Brien's novel \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,\\" is celebrated for its dark storyline, rich animation, and complex characters — a significant departure from the more commonly known animated features of its time. # 3. **David the Gnome (1985-1987)** \\"David the Gnome\\" is a Spanish animated television series based on the children's books by the Dutch author Wil Huygen and illustrator Rien Poortvliet. The show, which follows the adventures of the titular gnome doctor as he helps woodland creatures, offers a gentle storytelling pace that resonated with audiences in various countries, though it remains relatively unknown to many. # 4. **Gargoyles (1994-1997)** \\"Gargoyles\\" stands as a semi-obscure series primarily because, despite its critical acclaim and dedicated fanbase, it never quite reached the same commercial heights as other animated series from the 90s. Its dark tone, complex story arcs, and Shakespearean influences set it apart from much of its contemporaries and have earned it a respected place among animation aficionados. # 5. **Over the Garden Wall (2014)** As a mini-series, \\"Over the Garden Wall\\" mixes Americana folklore, fairy tales, and surreal elements, creating a hauntingly beautiful and unique narrative. Despite winning an Emmy and receiving critical acclaim, it remains a semi-obscure gem cherished by those who stumble upon it. # 6. **Fantastic Planet (La Planète Sauvage, 1973)** This Franco-Czech animated science fiction film is a cult classic that has flown under the radar for many. Directed by René Laloux and featuring surreal, distinctive art by Roland Topor, \\"Fantastic Planet\\" tells the story of humans living on a strange planet dominated by giant humanoid aliens. It's renowned for its peculiar and thought-provoking storytelling, as well as its psychedelic animation style. These titles represent just a tiny fraction of the vast, unexplored world of obscure and semi-obscure cartoons and animated films. Each one, with its unique flavor and storytelling, contributes valuable diversity to the landscape of animation and is worthy of exploration by anyone looking to discover something beyond mainstream offerings."},{"instruction":"How obscure is say, something like Wow Wow Wubbzy","output":"\\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" sits in an interesting position on the spectrum between mainstream popularity and obscurity. Premiering in 2006 and running until 2010, this animated children's series aired on Nick Jr., a platform known for its broad reach among preschool audiences in the United States and internationally. The show follows the adventures of Wubbzy and his friends Widget and Walden in the whimsical town of Wuzzleburg, focusing on themes of friendship, problem-solving, and curiosity. # Factors Contributing to Its Semi-Obscurity: 1. **Target Demographic:** As a show designed for preschoolers, its primary audience outgrows it quickly, which can lead to it fading from public consciousness faster than content aimed at a broader age range. 2. **Changing Media Landscape:** The late 2000s saw significant shifts in how children's content was distributed and consumed, with the rise of streaming services and on-demand viewing. Programs that didn't pivot to these new platforms as prominently might not have maintained widespread visibility. 3. **Competition:** The era in which \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" aired was rich with children's programming, both on cable channels like Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and PBS Kids, and emerging online platforms. Such competition can make it harder for any single show to dominate the cultural conversation. 4. **Cultural Impact:** While \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" enjoyed popularity and even spawned merchandise, live shows, and a following, it may not have had the broad cultural impact or the enduring legacy of some of its contemporaries, making it less prominent in discussions about iconic children’s shows from the late 2000s. # Continuing Presence: Despite these factors, \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" maintains a presence and fondness among those who grew up watching it or shared it with children during its original run and in reruns. Its vivid animation style, memorable characters, and catchy theme song (sung by Beyoncé for the movie \\"Wubb Idol\\") contribute to its lingering appeal.

In summary, while not entirely obscure, \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" might not possess the mainstream recognition of some other children's shows from its era but holds a semi-obscure status with a specific nostalgic appeal to those who remember it fondly."},{"instruction":"How obscure are things like Will and Dewitt, Monster Allergy and Horrid Henry","output":"\\"Will and Dewitt,\\" \\"Monster Allergy,\\" and \\"Horrid Henry\\" each occupy their unique positions on the spectrum between mainstream and obscure within the world of children's television and animated series. Their recognizability and popularity can vary significantly depending on factors like geographical location, target demographic, and availability on broadcasting platforms. Let's delve into each one: # Will and Dewitt \\"Will and Dewitt\\" is a Canadian-American animated children's series that first aired in 2007. The show focuses on a young boy named Will and his talking frog friend Dewitt as they tackle various challenges and adventures. Given its specific target demographic (younger children) and the fact that it didn’t have as many episodes or as wide a distribution as some other shows, \\"Will and Dewitt\\" is relatively obscure. It is fondly remembered by those who watched it during its original run, but it doesn't have a broad or enduring presence in popular culture. # Monster Allergy \\"Monster Allergy\\" is an Italian animated series that debuted in 2006, based on the comic book series of the same name. The show, which revolves around a boy named Zick who can see and interact with monsters, enjoyed popularity in several countries, notably Italy and parts of Europe. It was also distributed in the United States and other regions. Its specific appeal to fans of the fantasy and adventure genres and its roots in a comic series lend it a bit more visibility, particularly among those interested in international animation. However, despite its success and the fact that it spans multiple seasons, \\"Monster Allergy\\" can still be considered semi-obscure, especially outside of its primary fanbase or regions where it was most heavily promoted. # Horrid Henry \\"Horrid Henry\\" is a British animated series based on the books by Francesca Simon. First airing in 2006, it has since become one of the longest-running children's series on ITV. The show's focus on the titular character, Henry, and his \\"horrid\\" antics have made it quite popular in the UK, with a significant cultural impact that includes a wide range of merchandise, stage shows, and a film. While \\"Horrid Henry\\" enjoys strong recognition in the UK and has been broadcast in over 90 countries, its specific brand of humor and focus on British suburban life may not have translated to universal popularity, making it less well-known or semi-obscure in regions outside of its core fanbase. In summary, while each of these series has achieved a degree of success and has dedicated fans, their visibility and lasting impact on the broader cultural landscape vary. Factors like regional popularity, the platform and distribution reach, and the target audience's age play substantial roles in determining their obscurity level. \\"Monster Allergy\\" and \\"Horrid Henry\\" might be slightly more well-known due to their broader international distribution and longer run, respectively, but \\"Will and Dewitt\\" remains more obscure, particularly outside of North America."},{"instruction":"There's also this Porchlight/France 3 cartoon from 2005/2006 called Four Eyes!, The series centers around a misanthropic alien girl called Emma, who is sent to earth by her parents to repeat the fifth grade.

The premise of \\"Four Eyes!\\" revolves around Emma, a young alien girl deemed misanthropic, who is sent to Earth as a form of re-education, specifically tasked with repeating the fifth grade among human children. This setup offers a unique twist on the fish-out-of-water storyline, blending elements of science fiction with the trials and tribulations typical of school life that many children's series explore. The theme of an extraterrestrial character trying to navigate the complexities of human social structures, school dynamics, and childhood challenges presents fertile ground for both humor and heartfelt moments. However, despite its intriguing premise, \\"Four Eyes!\\" did not achieve widespread recognition or break into the mainstream in the way some other children’s series have. Several factors contribute to the obscurity of shows like \\"Four Eyes!\\": 1. **Distribution and Accessibility:** Limited international distribution and fewer broadcasting slots can make it difficult for a show to reach a wide audience. If \\"Four Eyes!\\" was not widely available outside of its original French broadcast and a select few international markets, many potential viewers may not have had the opportunity to watch it. 2. **Marketing and Merchandising:** Strong marketing campaigns and associated merchandise can play big roles in a show's popularity. Without significant promotional efforts or products to increase its visibility, a series might struggle to gain traction. 3. **Competitive Landscape:** The mid-2000s were a prolific time for children's television, with numerous new series debuting across different networks. \\"Four Eyes!\\" was competing for attention amidst a crowded field of content, making it hard for any single show to stand out. 4. **Cultural Resonance:** Some shows resonate more broadly due to their themes, humor, or characters. For various reasons, including cultural specifics and the relatability of characters, not every series manages to strike a chord with a broad audience. Given these factors, \\"Four Eyes!\\" exists as a fascinating piece of early 2000s children's programming history, remembered by a select group of fans and enthusiasts who either encountered it during its original run or have since discovered it while exploring the more obscure corners of animated television. Its obscurity, however, also makes it a prime candidate for rediscovery and appreciation by new audiences seeking unique and unconventional animated series that flew under the radar."},{"instruction":"It aired on CITV for a brief period in 2008/2009, I consider it to be THE most obscure toon of all time","output":"Your reference to \\"Four Eyes!\\" having aired on CITV (Children's ITV) in the UK during 2008/2009 provides valuable context that contributes to understanding its international reach and also hints at why it might hold a special place in the annals of obscure animated series. Given CITV's role as a significant platform for children's programming in the UK, the inclusion of \\"Four Eyes!\\" in its lineup suggests there was an attempt to broaden the show's audience beyond its initial French and potentially North American (through associations with Porchlight Entertainment) viewership. Considering such factors, the obscurity of \\"Four Eyes!\\" could be attributed to several elements: 1. **Brief Broadcast Period:** A short airing window on CITV, coupled with potentially limited promotion, would restrict its visibility even within a normally receptive audience. 2. **Competitive Timing:** The late 2000s were a particularly vibrant era for children's television, with numerous new shows launching and established ones dominating the space. \\"Four Eyes!\\" had to compete not only for screen time but for the affection of audiences amidst a surge of content. 3. **Niche Appeal:** The unique premise of \\"Four Eyes!\\"—focusing on a misanthropic alien girl integrating into a human school—while distinctive, might not have broadly resonated, limiting its appeal to a wider audience. 4. **Digital Presence and Availability:** For many modern shows, longevity and resurgence in popularity can stem from availability on digital platforms. If \\"Four Eyes!\\" didn't secure a spot on popular streaming services or digital purchase platforms post-broadcast, it would contribute to its obscurity. Amid discussions on animated series obscurity, \\"Four Eyes!\\" exemplifies how a combination of broadcasting strategy, competitive environment, and digital footprint can influence a show's legacy. While it may be considered amongst the most obscure, especially to those who remember its brief stint on CITV, its status also makes it a prime subject for rediscovery by enthusiasts of animation history and obscure media. For individuals and communities passionate about unearthing and celebrating lesser-known works, \\"Four Eyes!\\" represents a intriguing piece of the expansive, diverse world of animated storytelling."},{"instruction":"So we've gone down the obscurity meter, from semi popular (Monster Allergy), semi obscure (Wubbzy), mainly obscure (Will & Dewitt) and forgotten","output":"Navigating through the obscurity meter from semi-popular to forgotten titles offers a fascinating look at the vast spectrum of animated series and their impacts on audiences. The journey from shows like \\"Monster Allergy,\\" which holds a place of prominence in certain regions or among specific fan bases, down to \\"Four Eyes!,\\" largely considered forgotten or the most obscure, underscores the diverse nature of animation and its reception across different cultures and age groups. Let's briefly recap this exploration across the spectrum: # Semi-Popular: Monster Allergy \\"Monster Allergy\\" enjoys a level of popularity, especially in Italy and among fans of the original comic book series. Its unique storyline and appealing animation have garnered a dedicated following, making it semi-popular and well-remembered among certain circles. # Semi-Obscure: Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! \\"Wow! Wow!

Originating from Russia and first aired in 2004, the series has garnered a significant viewership in its home country and among Russian-speaking audiences, making it fairly well-known within that context. The show features a cast of round, anthropomorphic animal characters, each with distinct personalities and stories that impart moral and practical lessons in a non-preachy, entertaining manner. # Considering KikoRiki's Place on the Obscurity Chart: 1. **In Russia and Post-Soviet States:** In its country of origin and neighboring regions, \\"KikoRiki\\" would be considered quite popular. It holds a place in popular culture comparable to other major animated series, thanks to its broad appeal across various age groups, insightful content, and significant merchandise and media presence (including spin-offs and films). 2. **Internationally:** Outside the Russian-speaking world, \\"KikoRiki\\" sits toward the more obscure end of the spectrum, particularly in markets dominated by Western animation. However, it's not entirely unknown. The series has been dubbed into multiple languages and aired in several countries, including the United States (where it was known as \\"GoGoRiki\\" for a time), parts of Europe, and China. Its international recognition, though, varies widely and can largely depend on its local broadcasting presence and marketing efforts. 3. **Online and Streaming Platforms:** The digital age and the advent of streaming platforms have somewhat altered the dynamics of obscurity. \\"KikoRiki\\" is available on various online platforms, which may increase its accessibility and potentially its international fan base. However, it still faces the challenge of standing out among a vast array of children's content from around the globe. 4. **Niche Appeal:** Among enthusiasts of international animation or those specifically seeking non-Western animated content, \\"KikoRiki\\" could be considered a gem, occupying a niche but cherished spot. Its unique art style, humor, and educational value might attract viewers looking for alternative programming for children.

Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China’s peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China’s peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/“Mongol Empire” and its [the Great Mongol Nation’s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/“Song dynasty” and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China’s peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China].

Shikai’s reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai’s] legacy and [Shikai’s reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen’s chosen successor and heir of his [Wen’s] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen’s other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline.

A miscommunication between Wen/“Yat-Sen” and his [Wen’s] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria and Inner Mongolia as protectorates, [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/“Yat-Sen” is [Wen/“Yat-Sen”] killed [Wen/“Yat-Sen”] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen’s/“Yat-Sen”'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen’s/“Yat-Sen”'s] death. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/“Yat-Sen” and the Beiyang Government’s Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek’s] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia’s Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan’s Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of Han China. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond.","output":"**Chapter VII: An Era of Unprecedented Compromise and Evolution** The latter half of the nineteenth century in the East Asian geopolitical landscape was marked by a series of events that would reshape the socio-political structure of the region, setting the stage for a century of growth, conflict, and transformation. Among the most significant of these events was the compromise between the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty and the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan, a historic agreement that significantly altered the course of Japanese history. **The Compromise of Unity** The Meiji Restoration, as it came to be known, was not a singular revolution that saw the immediate and absolute transfer of power from the feudal lords and the Tokugawa shogunate to the Imperial House, as many might believe. Instead, it evolved into a nuanced compromise that saw the merging of old and new, tradition and modernity, creating a hybrid system of governance that retained the integrity of Japan's historical institutions while embracing the winds of change that were sweeping across the globe. The Tokugawa leaders were not ousted but transformed into figures akin to the Reichskanzlers of Europe, holding significant sway over the military and bureaucratic mechanisms of the state, yet acknowledging the supreme authority of the Emperor. This arrangement allowed for a smoother transition, avoiding the pitfalls of violent upheaval and civil unrest that could have torn the nation asunder. **Samurai and Daimyo Integration** The buke, or samurai class, along with the daimyo, found new roles within this transformed empire. They were not abolished but were intricately woven into the fabric of the new society as part of the Kazoku, the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire. This inclusion served to pacify potential dissent and utilize their considerable skills and loyalty for the nation's benefit. **Territorial Expansion and International Relations** The Japanese Empire, under this hybrid governance model, continued its trajectory of expansion and modernization. The acquisition of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands following the First Sino-Japanese War, and the transformation of Korea into a protectorate, laid the groundwork for Japan's emergence as a regional powerhouse. The integration of various scripts, the aggressive promotion of industrial and educational reforms in Korea, and the gradual dismantling of feudal classes under a coherent and unified Japanese administration showcased a nation in rapid transition. **The Xinhai Revolution and the Empire of China** Across the Sea of Japan, the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the rise of the Empire of China under the Zhu family, with Yuan Shikai's instrumental role, reflected a parallel transformation. The endorsement of the Ming restoration, supported by various Chinese factions and foreign entities, including Japan, highlighted the interconnectedness of East Asian politics and the shared ambition for reform and modernization while retaining each nation's distinct cultural heritage. **The Empire of Unity and the Nationalist Challenge** The political landscape of China, with the establishment of a coherent aristocracy merging various dynastic legacies, and the implementation of a modern governance model, demonstrated an alternative path to nation-state formation in the context of global imperialism and colonialism. The National Protection War, and the subsequent stabilization of the region under a multipolar system of power, represented a unique evolution of East Asian international relations. **Continuity and Change in the Twentieth Century** As the twentieth century unfolded, the region saw the unfolding of alternate conflicts, alliances, and socio-political experiments that diverged significantly from other timelines. The survival and coexistence of the Japanese Empire, the Empire of China, Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and an independent Nationalist China showcased a complex web of relations, shaped by internal reforms, external pressures, and the shared history of a continent in flux. **Conclusion** This chapter of our documentary history book delves into a world of what-ifs, exploring the myriad ways in which the compromise of 1868, and the subsequent geopolitical developments, could have reshaped not only East Asia but the very fabric of global history. It posits a scenario where tradition and modernity blend seamlessly, where empires evolve rather than perish, and where the legacy of ancient lineages finds new expression in the modern world. It is a tale of unity amidst diversity, of growth amidst challenges, and of a shared destiny forged by the twin forces of compromise and adaptation."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue, royal intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a novel chapter style format, focusing on how the compromise between the reformers and the traditionalists within the Tokugawa shogunate that lead to the Meiji Restoration was achieved and how the Great Japanese Empire dealt with samurai who refused to accept the new order within Japan.","output":"**Chapter IX: Shadows over Edo** In the heart of Edo, beneath the looming shadow of the castle, the future of Japan was being forged—not in the grand chambers of the shogunate, nor in the opulent halls of the Imperial Palace, but in the dimly lit backrooms of a seemingly inconspicuous teahouse. The year was 1867, a year that would be etched in history as the dawn of a new era, but also a year that teetered on the brink of civil war. The teahouse, known only to a select few as *The Chrysanthemum's Whisper*, had become the unlikely setting for negotiations between representatives of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty and the staunchest allies of the Tokugawa shogunate. The air was thick with the scent of incense and the tension of impending change. Kazuo, a samurai of the old order and a fervent supporter of the Tokugawa regime, found himself seated across from Akira, a young noble affiliated with the more progressive Imperial supporters. Both understood the gravity of their secret meeting—a compromise was essential to avoid the bloodshed that threatened to engulf their nation. \\"The age of the samurai as we know it is at an end,\\" Akira began, his voice steady despite the weight of his words. \\"But it is within our power to redefine our role, to merge tradition with the progress that our country desperately needs.\\" Kazuo clenched his fists beneath the table, the mention of abandoning their way of life stinging like a betrayal. Yet, deep down, he knew the truth in Akira's words. The world was changing. Japan had to adapt or be left behind. \\"And what of the shogunate?\\" Kazuo asked, his voice tinged with defiance. \\"Do we simply cast aside the system that has governed our lands for over two centuries?\\" \\"The shogunate will evolve, not dissolve,\\" Akira replied. \\"Think of it as a transformation. The ruling heads of the Tokugawa clan could serve as guardians of this new era, much like the Reichskanzlers of the West. The Emperor would reign supreme, but your expertise, your loyalty... it would be invaluable in guiding Japan through these turbulent times.\\" The negotiations stretched into the early hours of the morning, with both parties painstakingly crafting the foundation of a new government—a compromise that would usher in the Meiji Restoration while preserving the honor and influence of the samurai. Meanwhile, not far from *The Chrysanthemum's Whisper*, a different kind of meeting was taking place. In the shadowy depths of Edo's underbelly, a faction of samurai who refused to accept the impending change gathered, led by a formidable warrior, Tetsuya. Word of the negotiations had reached them, fueling their resolve to resist the new order at all costs. Tetsuya stood before his followers, his eyes burning with a fierce determination. \\"The way of the warrior is not one of compromise and diplomacy. It is a path of honor and loyalty. We will not stand idly by while the traditions of our forefathers are trampled upon,\\" he declared, drawing his katana and holding it high above his head. A chorus of blades unsheathing echoed through the chamber, a testament to their unwavering resolve. As the dawn broke over Edo, the city found itself at a crossroads. On one side, the promise of a new Japan, guided by both progress and tradition. On the other, the specter of resistance, a refusal to relinquish the past without a fight. The streets of Edo, once bustling with the daily affairs of its citizens, became the stage for a conflict that would test the very soul of Japan. Tetsuya and his followers launched a series of brazen attacks against symbols of the new regime, hoping to ignite a broader rebellion. But the newly formed government was prepared. Leveraging the advancements in steampunk and diesel-powered technology, they mobilized a specialized unit of troops, a hybrid force of samurai and imperial soldiers, equipped with cutting-edge weaponry and armored steam engines. Skirmishes erupted across the city, a chaotic blend of traditional swordplay and mechanized warfare. Yet, amidst the violence, there were moments of unexpected unity. Old enemies found common ground in their love for their country, leading to pockets of resistance laying down their arms and joining the ranks of the new order. In the end, the compromise between the reformers and traditionalists forged in the secluded teahouse proved stronger than the will of those who sought to resist change by force. Japan would emerge from the turmoil of the Meiji Restoration not divided, but as a unified empire, ready to face the challenges of a new era together. The final skirmish took place beneath the ancient sakura trees outside Edo, a poetic setting for the closing act of a centuries-old way of life. Tetsuya, wounded and beleaguered, found himself face to face with Akira, who had taken to the field to quell the last of the resistance. \\"Come with us,\\" Akira offered, extending a hand to his former adversary. \\"Help us build a new Japan. Your strength, your courage... it belongs in this new era, not in the past.\\" Tetsuya looked up at the man who had once been his enemy, now his potential ally. The resolve in Akira's eyes, the promise of a future where honor and progress could coexist, was enough to quell the fire of rebellion in his heart. With a nod of acceptance, Tetsuya sheathed his sword for the last time, stepping into the uncertain dawn of a new age for Japan, an age of steam and steel, tradition and innovation—an age of unity."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a novel chapter style format, focusing on the compromise between the reformers and the traditionalists within the Tokugawa shogunate that lead to the Meiji Restoration was achieved and how the then newly formed Great Japanese Empire dealt with samurai who refused to accept the new order within Japan.","output":"**Chapter XII: The Iron Geisha and the Last Samurai** In the heart of Tokyo, once called Edo, where the steam-powered street lamps cast long shadows on the cobblestone roads, and the air was thick with the scent of coal and cherry blossoms, lay the heart of the Great Japanese Empire's power. This new era, brought forth by the compromise between the reformers and the traditionalists, had forever altered the landscape of Japan. Yet, not all souls had found peace in this brave new world. The Imperial Palace, a magnificent fusion of traditional Japanese architecture and Victorian steampunk aesthetics, buzzed with the whispers of court intrigue and the clanking of gears. Here, the Emperor sat upon his throne, flanked by mechanical samurai guards, their diesel engines softly purring. The Imperial Court had become a battleground, not of swords, but of wits and whispers, where traditionalists and reformers continued their dance of power. Among the courtiers was Aiko, known to the masses as the Iron Geisha. A formidable figure, Aiko was neither truly a geisha nor made of iron, but a master spy for the Emperor, her beauty and wit only surpassed by her loyalty. Her kimono, adorned with gears and cogs, concealed a multitude of gadgets and weapons, all powered by steam and cunning craftsmanship. She was a bridge between the old ways and the new, respected and feared in equal measure. The Emperor, a young ruler named Meiji, had summoned Aiko to his private chamber, a marvel of innovation with moving walls and secret passages, all hidden beneath exquisite silk tapestries. \\"Aiko,\\" he began, his voice steady, \\"there is a storm brewing within our lands. The last of the samurai who refuse our rule have vanished into the mist, akin to ghosts of the past. Yet, their anger festers. We must find them, understand them, or we risk everything our compromise has built.\\" Aiko bowed deeply, her face a mask of grace. \\"My Emperor, consider it done. The shadows whisper many secrets to those willing to listen.\\" Thus, Aiko began her quest through the bustling streets of Tokyo and beyond, into the rural heartlands where steam tractors plowed the fields and diesel trains cut through the countryside, carrying progress in their wake. Yet, not all were ready to embrace this new dawn. Hidden in the mountains, a fortress stood, untouched by time or technology. It was here that the last samurai, led by a noble warrior named Hideaki, had sought refuge. Hideaki, stern and resolute, had watched the world change from afar, his heart a storm of loyalty to a way of life that no longer existed. It was in the dead of night, under the light of a full moon, that the Iron Geisha found herself at the gates of this fortress, her mechanical gadgets silenced, her mission clear. Yet, as she entered the stronghold, she found not bitter warriors ready for battle but a people lost, clinging to memories and honor. Hideaki greeted her, not with hostility but with weary resignation. \\"Iron Geisha,\\" he addressed her, his voice echoing the sorrow of the ages, \\"we are but shadows now, relics of a bygone era. What does the Emperor want with the likes of us?\\" Aiko, moved by his words, realized that the heart of the issue lay not in resistance but in reconciliation. \\"The Emperor seeks to understand, to offer a hand in unity. The world has room for all, for tradition and for progress. Your wisdom and strength are needed now, more than ever, to guide Japan into the future.\\" Days turned into weeks as Aiko lived among the last samurai, sharing stories, understanding their fears and dreams, and slowly, a bridge was built between the past and the present. In a grand ceremony held in the Imperial Palace, where steam and silk intertwined, Hideaki and his warriors pledged their loyalty to the Emperor, not as subjects, but as guardians of Japan's soul. The compromise was renewed, a testament to the idea that unity was not in erasure, but in the merging of paths. The Iron Geisha, her mission completed, watched as the last samurai laid down their swords at the Emperor's feet, not in defeat, but in trust. Japan had truly entered a new era, where steam engines roared alongside the whispers of the wind, and the spirit of the samurai lived on, not in opposition, but in harmony with the heartbeat of progress. And so, the Great Japanese Empire thrived, a beacon of unity and innovation, a land where tradition and the future danced in the streets, beneath the watchful eyes of the Iron Geisha and the last of the samurai."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a novel chapter style format, focusing on the birth and development of the Great Japanese Empire's ground combat warfare unit, the Imperial Japanese Army [IJA] and also the simultaneous development of the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and also that of the within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and the growth and development of the IJA into a major military force in East Asia, [the IJA] equipped with the best and most modern technology.","output":"**Chapter XVII: The Iron Will and the Hidden Blade** In the wake of reconciliation and the dawn of a unified Japan, the Empire saw the birth of its greatest protector and most subtle weapon: the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and its shadow, the Kempeitai, alongside the Tokkō operating under the Japanese Home Ministry. As the Great Japanese Empire expanded its horizons, these forces became the iron will and hidden blade, safeguarding the burgeoning might of a nation reborn from the ashes of feudal strife. **The Foundation of Power: The Imperial Japanese Army** As the 19th century waned and the 20th century dawned with the promise of industrial marvels, the Japanese Empire was quick to adapt the lessons of the West while infusing them with the spirit of the samurai. The establishment of the Imperial Japanese Army marked the transition from swords to steam-powered rifles and armor-clad zeppelins. At the heart of Tokyo, in a complex of buildings where steam vents intertwined with traditional torii gates, the planning and strategy of the IJA took shape. Led by a council of former samurai and innovative military tacticians, the army was a fusion of discipline and technology. Training grounds, vast and meticulously maintained, housed soldiers drilling beside mechanized infantry units and diesel-powered exoskeletons that enhanced their natural abilities, making them a formidable force capable of swift, decisive actions across varied terrains. **The Shadow Corps: The Kempeitai and the Tokkō** Yet, an empire's strength is not solely measured by the might of its armies but also by the keenness of its intelligence and the efficacy of its policing force. The Kempeitai, birthed from the necessity of maintaining order within the ranks and in occupied territories, evolved into a force both feared and respected. Clad in black uniforms with a single, silver gear emblem, they were the silent guardians of military discipline, their reach extending far beyond the barracks to the very streets of the cities under Japanese rule. Simultaneously, within the labyrinthine halls of the Japanese Home Ministry, the Tokkō operated as the empire's keen eyes and ears, weaving a network of informants and agents that spanned the globe. Tasked with rooting out dissent and protecting the state from both internal and external threats, they were the hidden blade, striking unseen at those who would dare disrupt the public order or challenge the Emperor's will. **The Iron Behemoths: Technological Marvels of the IJA** As the IJA expanded its influence, so too did its arsenal. The Empire's brightest minds, housed within secretive research facilities, labored to produce weapons that blurred the lines between science fiction and reality. Ironclad behemoths, steam-powered tanks with the agility of cavalry units, roamed the battlefields, while airships, armed with cannons and escorted by squadrons of biplane fighters, dominated the skies. The crowning achievement of this era of innovation was the creation of the \\"Shogun's Fist,\\" a massive, diesel-powered automaton capable of decimating enemy fortifications with a single blow. Standing tall amidst the smoke and clamor of the battlefield, these machines were a testament to the Empire's might and ingenuity. **The Waxing Influence of the Kempeitai and Tokkō** As the shadow of war loomed ever larger on the horizon, the Kempeitai's grip on the occupied territories tightened. Their methods, though sometimes harsh, were designed to keep the wheels of the empire turning, through the requisition of resources and the quelling of resistance. Meanwhile, the Tokkō's web of spies and informants infiltrated every level of society, rooting out subversives and ensuring the populace's loyalty. **The Crescendo of Power** As the 20th century marched forward, the Great Japanese Empire stood as a colossus in East Asia, its might upheld by the steely resolve of the Imperial Japanese Army and shadowed by the vigilant watch of the Kempeitai and Tokkō. Together, they forged a nation that was as relentless in its pursuit of progress as it was unyielding in the defense of its sovereignty. The Empire had become a symphony of steam and steel, a fusion of tradition and innovation, with the IJA as its beating heart and the Kempeitai and Tokkō as its protective soul. In this age of empires, Japan was poised not only to compete but to dominate, riding the crest of a wave powered by the Iron Will and the Hidden Blade."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on the development of Pan-Asianism within the Greater Japanese Empire as well as the development of the belief that Japan was the true successor to the Han Chinese civilization that had flourished under the Song and Ming dynasties and had been suppressed under the Mongol Empire, the Yuan dynasty and the Great Qing Empire within Japan, as well as the covert training, backing and arming of of the anti-Qing, anti-Manchu Han nationalist and Han supremacist paramilitary groups and intellectual organizations that would later provide the basis for the Tongmenghui and Kuomingntang by the Japanese political, aristocratic and noble elite and also by the Kempeitai.","output":"**Chapter XXII: Echoes of the Dragon Spirit** In a secluded chamber adorned with silk scrolls depicting the golden eras of the Song and Ming dynies, deep within the steel heart of Tokyo's Imperial Palace, a clandestine meeting was underway. The room, illuminated by the soft glow of oil lamps retrofitted with electric filaments, hummed with the whispered fervor of ideologies both new and ancient. Here, amidst relics of a time when the dragon spirit thrived unfettered, the architects of a grand vision for Asia convened. Sitting at the head of the lacquered mahogany table was Lord Katsuro, a statesman whose lineage could be traced back to the noble warriors that once defended the Japanese archipelago. To his right, General Yamada, a decorated officer of the Imperial Japanese Army whose military acumen was only matched by his steam-powered prosthetic arm—a marvel of engineering. Flanking the other side was Master Takeda, a scholar of the highest order, his life dedicated to reviving the intellectual grandeur of the Han Chinese civilization. Lord Katsuro cleared his throat, drawing the room's attention. \\"Gentlemen,\\" he began, his voice a blend of resolve and reverence, \\"we stand on the cusp of remolding Asia into a bastion of unity and power, led by the indomitable spirit of Japan. Yet, our vision extends beyond mere dominion. It is our sacred duty to awaken the slumbering dragon of Han civilization, suppressed for centuries under foreign rule.\\" General Yamada nodded, his mechanical fingers tapping rhythmically on the table. \\"Our armies stand ready, Lord Katsuro. But the battle for Asia's soul will not be won by steel and steam alone. We must forge alliances with those who share our vision across the continent, especially within the heart of Han China.\\" Master Takeda leaned forward, his eyes ablaze with passion. \\"Indeed, General. The Song and Ming dynasties represented the pinnacle of Chinese civilization—moments in time when art, science, and philosophy flourished. It is this spirit, this essence, that we seek to rekindle through our support of the anti-Qing, anti-Manchu movements.\\" Lord Katsuro nodded, a plan forming in the shadows of his mind. \\"Our agents within the Kempeitai have been instrumental in laying the groundwork. They've covertly trained, backed, and armed a network of patriots and scholars opposed to Qing rule. The seeds of revolution have been sown.\\" General Yamada leaned in, a glint of intrigue in his eyes. \\"The Tongmenghui and Kuomingtang, you mean? They are but scattered voices crying out for freedom. Under our guidance, they could become a symphony of liberation.\\" Master Takeda interjected, \\"A symphony that sings the song of Pan-Asianism, gentlemen. A chorus that proclaims Japan not as conqueror, but as liberator and successor to the great Han civilization. Our support of these organizations is not mere altruism; it is the very embodiment of our belief in a united, prosperous Asia under the enlightened leadership of the Japanese Empire.\\" Lord Katsuro raised a hand, silencing the room. \\"Let us not forget, however, the subtlety required in our endeavors. The world watches us closely, wary of our ambitions. Our support for the Tongmenghui and Kuomingtang must remain in the shadows, guided by the unseen hand of the Kempeitai. We shall be the catalysts for change, igniting the flames of revolution without ever being consumed by them.\\" General Yamada's mechanical arm whirred softly as he made a fist. \\"Then let us proceed with both the might of our army and the cunning of our intelligence services. Together, we shall sculpt the future of Asia into a monument to unity, strength, and the indomitable spirit of its peoples.\\" Lord Katsuro stood, his gaze sweeping over the conspirators. \\"To the renewal of the dragon spirit and the dawn of a Pan-Asian empire led by Japan.\\" His declaration was met with a chorus of affirmations, each voice in the room adding weight to the invisible pact that bound them. As the meeting adjourned, the chamber's heavy doors swung open, revealing the gleaming skyline of Tokyo—a city that stood as a testament to the empire's technological prowess and imperial ambition.

Their gazes were fixed on the imposing figures of General Sakamoto of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and Admiral Watanabe himself, both men symbols of Japan's military might. \\"The Qing Empire's Beiyang Navy looms large, gentlemen,\\" began Admiral Watanabe, his eyes scanning the battleground laid before them on the map. \\"But size is not the sole determinant of victory. Our strength lies in our training, our discipline, and the ingenuity of our machines of war.\\" General Sakamoto, just returned from coordinating ground forces along the Korean Peninsula, nodded in agreement. \\"Indeed, Admiral. The Qing's New Army may outnumber our forces, but their lack of cohesion and poor supply lines are their undoing. Our soldiers are battle-hardened and loyal, equipped with the finest that our nation's steam-powered arsenal can afford.\\" A young naval officer, Lieutenant Yamamoto, stepped forward, pointing to a position on the map. \\"Sir, intelligence suggests the main contingent of the Beiyang Navy is clustering near Weihaiwei. Our submarines, with their diesel engines, could slip past their patrols undetected and deliver a crippling blow before they realize the depths from which we strike.\\" Admiral Watanabe's gaze lingered on the marked position, the gears in his mind turning. \\"An astute observation, Lieutenant. Moreover, our airships, with their bird's-eye view, can provide critical reconnaissance and, when armed, serve as formidable opponents from above. We shall not merely confront the dragon; we shall ensnare it from all sides.\\" General Sakamoto, folding his arms, added, \\"And on land, our mechanized infantry units, supported by steam-powered artillery, will press forward. The Qing's reliance on traditional cavalry will be their downfall. When faced with our ironclad behemoths, their horses will falter.\\" \\"But sir,\\" interjected Captain Inoue, a veteran of numerous naval campaigns, \\"the Qing are not without cunning. Their fortifications along the coast are formidable, and their German-made Krupp guns could prove troublesome for our ships.\\" Admiral Watanabe met Captain Inoue's concern with a confident smile. \\"Which is why we will not engage them in a battle of attrition. Precision, speed, and innovation will secure our victory. Our engineers have been developing torpedoes specifically designed to breach such defenses. Coupled with coordinated airship bombardments, we will pierce the heart of the Beiyang Navy before their guns can reach our fleet.\\" General Sakamoto chimed in, \\"Coordination between our forces will be key. The IJA and IJN acting as a single blade, cutting through the Qing's defenses on land and sea. Our telegraph lines and signal balloons will ensure we remain in lockstep, a unified front against a fragmented foe.\\" The room filled with the murmur of agreement as the officers around the table visualized the campaign unfolding, a harmonious symphony of steam-powered destruction and strategic prowess. Admiral Watanabe raised his hand, calling for silence. \\"Gentlemen, let this battle be a testament to the might of the Great Japanese Empire. Our resolve is ironclad, our purpose righteous. Under the banner of the rising sun, we shall usher in a new era for Asia, one guided by the enlightened rule of Japan.\\" Salutes were exchanged as the officers dispersed, each to his respective post, hearts emboldened by the prospect of imminent victory.

The ground trembled beneath the feet of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) as steam-powered tanks and mechanized infantry units advanced in unison, a formidable force of modern engineering and traditional warrior spirit. High above, airships dotted the sky, their cannons primed and ready. On the other side, the vast expanse was filled with the Qing New Army, a massive but irregular force, bearing a mix of outdated muskets and newly acquired rifles. Behind them, the formidable silhouette of the Beiyang Navy loomed in the distance, their ships anchored defensively near the coastline, Krupp guns aimed towards the advancing Japanese forces. General Sakamoto surveyed the battlefield from the vantage point of his mobile command center, a fortified steam carriage. Beside him, Captain Tsubasa, leader of the samurai units, stood resolute, his armor gleaming under the setting sun. \\"The Qing forces are numerous, but we have the advantage of mobility and technology,\\" General Sakamoto stated, his voice steady despite the tension in the air.

Let us show the Qing the true might of the Great Japanese Empire.\\" A decisive nod from the Captain, and the order was given. Japanese airships descended, unleashing a hail of explosive ordinance on the Qing New Army's front lines, causing chaos and disarray. Below, the IJA's steam tanks rolled forward, their cannons firing relentlessly, while samurai units, swift and silent, flanked the enemy on both sides. Captain Tsubasa led his samurai in a charge that would be remembered in history. As the tanks created breaches in the enemy's defenses, the samurai exploited these openings, engaging the Qing soldiers in close combat. Despite the enemy's numbers, the precision and ferocity of the samurai proved overwhelming. At sea, the sounds of underwater explosions signaled the engagement of the IJN's submarines against the Beiyang Navy. The once-mighty fleet found itself besieged from below, unable to retaliate against foes they could neither see nor predict. \\"The spirit of the samurai guides us!\\" Captain Tsubasa shouted above the din of battle, his voice rallying his men even as they clashed sword against bayonet. Onboard the IJN flagship, *The Rising Sun*, Admiral Watanabe watched through his binoculars as the first of the Beiyang ships started to list, hit by unseen torpedoes. \\"For every wave against our shores, we return a tsunami,\\" he declared, a cold resolve in his voice. As night fell, the outcome of the battle became apparent. The combined might of the IJA and IJN, along with the fearless valor of the samurai, had dealt a crushing blow to the Qing forces. The New Army, despite their numbers, could not withstand the onslaught of steam and steel, and the mighty Beiyang Navy was left crippled in the wake of Japan's underwater assault. General Sakamoto, standing amidst the smoldering remains of what was once a battlefield, turned to Captain Tsubasa. \\"This victory is but the first step towards a greater destiny for Japan.

On horseback and foot, with sword and gun, we will restore honor to these lands, breaking the chains of Qing imperialism.\\" The plan was set into motion. As the IJN secured the waters around Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, IJA troops, guided by the swift maneuvers of the samurai, began the liberation of Joeson. The sight of Japanese flags hoisted above former Qing outposts signaled the dawn of a new day. Meanwhile, whispers of Ming restorationism began to stir among the Han people. Fueled by the Japanese victory and the dissemination of ideals by the Yellow Sand Society, a covert network of intellectuals and patriots, a renewed sense of identity and purpose took root. In the liberated cities of Joeson, General Sakamoto met with local leaders, pledging support and cooperation. \\"The Great Japanese Empire seeks not to conquer but to liberate,\\" he declared, his voice echoing through the crowded squares. \\"Together, we can build a future free of Qing oppression, one where our cultures and traditions flourish side by side.\\" The sentiment resonated deeply with the people of Joeson, who, inspired by the promise of autonomy and respect, began to view their liberators in a new light.

One crisp morning, Governor-General Hasegawa convened a meeting with his closest advisors, including representatives from the Kempeitai and Tokkō units, to assess the ongoing efforts to modernize Joeson and suppress any lingering resistance. \\"Progress continues apace,\\" Hasegawa began, unfolding a detailed map across the table. \\"The railways extend further each day, bringing with them the promise of prosperity. However, prosperity alone cannot quell the disquiet among the yangaban and followers of the House of Jeonji Yi.\\" Captain Inoue of the Tokkō leaned forward, his eyes steely. \\"The suppression of these elements is essential for the stability of Joeson. Our agents have identified key figures within the yangaban who clandestinely oppose our efforts. They perpetuate outdated customs and hinder our initiatives.\\" Lieutenant Kuroda of the Kempeitai nodded in agreement. \\"Indeed, Captain. We've been conducting operations to dismantle their influence. Just last night, we apprehended several yangaban members plotting to sabotage the railway construction. Their anti-Japanese sentiment poses a direct threat to our mission.\\" Governor-General Hasegawa stroked his chin thoughtfully. \\"While force is sometimes necessary, we must not forget the importance of winning hearts and minds. The introduction of schools teaching Japanese language and sciences is as crucial as our military presence. We must elevate the common people of Joeson, show them the benefits of our governance.\\" A voice, softer yet firm, interjected from the end of the table. It was Dr. Sato, the Japanese-appointed advisor for educational reform in Joeson. \\"Governor-General, the new schools have indeed been a success. Enrollment numbers are rising, and there's a genuine eagerness among the youth to learn. This, I believe, is where the true transformation of Joeson lies.\\" Hasegawa nodded, pleased. \\"Excellent, Dr. Sato. Education is the foundation upon which we will build a modern, industrialized nation-state here in Joeson. As for the yangaban and those loyal to the House of Jeonji Yi, we will continue our efforts to neutralize their opposition. Captain Inoue, Lieutenant Kuroda, your work is vital, but remember, coercion alone will not secure our legacy here.\\" Captain Inoue bowed slightly. \\"Understood, Governor-General. Our actions will be measured but decisive. The kempeitai and Tokkō are committed to ensuring the security and progress of Joeson.\\" As the meeting adjourned, the officials filed out of the room, each burdened with the weight of their responsibilities. Outside, the streets of Keijo buzzed with activity, a visible sign of the changing times. Steam-powered trams glided past traditional hanok houses, symbolizing the juxtaposition of the old and new. In the countryside, the whispers of discontent among the yangaban simmered beneath the surface, their centuries-old privilege eroding away with each mile of railway track laid. Yet, within the schools and factories that dotted the landscape, a new generation of Joesonese looked to the future with hope, embracing the opportunities that the Japanese protectorate promised. The path forward was fraught with challenges, both ideological and physical, but the wheels of progress continued to turn, driven by the combined efforts of Japanese ingenuity and the aspiring hearts of the Joesonese people. In this complex dance of suppression and enlightenment, the fate of Joeson as a modern, somewhat industrialized nation-state hung delicately in the balance."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, still focusing on the development and growth of Joeson into a modern, somewhat industrialized nation state under Japanese influence after the First Sino-Japanese War and the subsequent simultaneous suppression of the yangaban and anti-Japanese elements of the House of Jeonji Yi by the Kempeitai and Tokkō units stationed within the Korean peninsula but having a direct locus on the suppression of Confucianist and neo-Confucianist thought and traditional Korean shamanism from among the Korean people by the Japanese and the simultaneous promotion of Shinto, Buddhism and Christianity to replace these.","output":"**Chapter XXXVII: The Winds of Change** The heart of Joeson, now throbbing with the pulse of steam engines and clattering of printing presses, was a testament to an era teetering on the blade of modernity and tradition. The Governor-General's office in Keijo was abuzz with the latest reports from the countryside, where the Japanese efforts to reshape the spiritual and intellectual landscape of Joeson faced fierce, if silent, resistance. Governor-General Hasegawa leaned back in his chair, his fingers tented as he listened to the briefing from his advisors. Among them were agents of the Kempeitai and Tokkō, along with cultural officers tasked with implementing the Japanese vision of enlightenment. \\"Governor-General, the suppression of Confucianist and neo-Confucianist thought is progressing, albeit slower than anticipated,\\" began Agent Mori of the Tokkō. \\"The yangaban's grip on these ideologies remains strong, and the common people still cling to their teachings for guidance.\\" Hasegawa nodded, his expression unreadable. \\"And what of our efforts to introduce Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity as alternatives?\\" Cultural Officer Takahashi stepped forward, a sheaf of reports in hand. \\"Shinto and Buddhism have found some acceptance, especially among the younger generations in urban areas. Christianity, however, faces opposition, not only from traditionalists but from those wary of Western influences.\\" The Governor-General's gaze shifted to a large map on the wall, dotted with markers indicating schools, shrines, and churches spread across Joeson. \\"It seems we must navigate a delicate path. Our objective is not merely to suppress old ideologies but to foster a new landscape of thought—one that aligns with the modern nation we are building.\\" Agent Kimura of the Kempeitai added, \\"Our recent operations against practitioners of traditional Korean shamanism have been effective in diminishing its public presence. However, it continues to persist in secluded communities, Governor-General.\\" Hasegawa steepled his fingers, contemplating. \\"Shamanism, like Confucianism, is deeply woven into the fabric of Joeson society. Our challenge is to present Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity not as replacements but as extensions of the people's spiritual journey.\\" Officer Takahashi chimed in, \\"Perhaps, Governor-General, our approach should include more engagement with community leaders. Demonstrating the parallels between Shinto and traditional shamanistic practices could ease the transition. Similarly, highlighting Buddhism's historical presence in Joeson and Christianity's emphasis on compassion might soften resistance.\\" The room fell into thoughtful silence as the weight of Takahashi's suggestion sank in. Hasegawa finally broke the silence. \\"Takahashi-san, your proposal has merit. We must wield culture with the same precision we use force. Arrange meetings with local leaders—teachers, priests, even artists. Let us weave these new threads into the tapestry of Joeson society together.\\" Agent Mori raised an eyebrow. \\"And the yangaban and other anti-Japanese elements, Governor-General?\\" Hasegawa's expression hardened. \\"They will be dealt with by the Kempeitai and Tokkō. Opposition to our rule cannot be tolerated. However, our primary battle is one of hearts and minds. We cannot rule by fear alone.\\" As the meeting adjourned, the advisors left with a new directive, one that highlighted the complexities of governing a nation caught between epochs. The campaign to mold Joeson's spiritual and intellectual identity was just as critical as any military conquest. Through the streets of Keijo, where Western attire mingled with hanbok and the air resonated with the mingled scents of Korean cuisine and Japanese tea, the story of Joeson's transformation unfolded—a tale of suppression and promotion, of erasing and rewriting, of holding tight to identity amid the tides of change."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, s focusing on the transformation of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands under Japanese rule after the First Sino-Japanese War into the Japanese province of Formosa and the simultaneous industrial, economic and educational development going on there [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] as the Japanese work to make the Taiwanese aboriginals and the Hoklo people originally from Southern China's Fujian province who had assimilated into Taiwan over the centuries and become indigenous to the region into Japanese citizens.","output":"**Chapter XL: The Loom of Progress** The governor's mansion in Taipei, a grand structure that melded Japanese architectural sophistication with local Taiwanese elements, stood as a symbol of the new era that dawned on the island province of Formosa. Within its walls, Governor Ishikawa convened a crucial meeting to discuss the transformation of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands under Japanese rule. \\"The assimilation of the Taiwanese aborigines and the Hoklo is paramount,\\" Ishikawa stated, addressing his council of Japanese officials and local leaders. \\"Our mission transcends mere governance; it is to integrate these peoples into the greater fabric of the Japanese Empire as loyal and productive citizens.\\" Doctor Yamazaki, appointed head of educational reform, was the first to respond. \\"The establishment of schools throughout the province is already underway, Governor. We are not only teaching the Japanese language but also introducing students to Japanese culture, history, and values. However, we face resistance, particularly in remote regions where traditional tribal structures remain strong.\\" Ishikawa nodded, expecting such challenges. \\"And what of our efforts in economic and industrial development?\\" Minister Tanaka, overseeing economic policy, leaned forward. \\"The agricultural reforms have seen success, with increased productivity in both rice and sugar cane cultivation. We've also begun to introduce small-scale factories utilizing steam technology for processing these crops. However, the true potential lies in harnessing Formosa's coal reserves. This will not only power our industrial expansion but also provide employment and foster economic loyalty among the Taiwanese and Hoklo populations.\\" A local Hoklo leader, Mr. Chen, who had shown a willingness to cooperate with the Japanese administration, spoke up. \\"Governor, my people are willing to learn and adapt, but we seek assurances that our rights and traditions will be respected. The sudden changes, while promising, have also sown fear and confusion.\\" Ishikawa listened intently, aware of the delicate balance his administration needed to maintain. \\"Mr. Chen, let me be clear—the Japanese Empire views Formosa as a land of great promise. Your traditions and rights will be protected, so long as they align with our overarching goal of unity and progress. We aim to build a society where every citizen, regardless of origin, can thrive.\\" A murmur of agreement went around the room, though Ishikawa could sense the underlying apprehension. \\"To this end,\\" he continued, \\"we will establish community centers where both Japanese and local customs can be celebrated. Furthermore, I propose the formation of a council consisting of Taiwanese and Hoklo leaders to advise the administration on matters of cultural integration.\\" This suggestion was met with cautious optimism, a sign that Ishikawa's message was resonating. \\"Lastly,\\" Ishikawa concluded, \\"I wish to address the issue of citizenship. Upon completion of our educational program, and with demonstrated loyalty to the Empire, full Japanese citizenship will be granted to the Taiwanese and Hoklo. This is not merely an administrative process, but a covenant between us, promising a future of shared prosperity and harmony.\\" As the meeting adjourned, the participants left with mixed feelings—hope mingled with skepticism, enthusiasm tempered by the weight of historical grievances. Yet, the wheels of progress, once set in motion, were hard to stop. Outside, the streets of Taipei buzzed with activity. Steam trams carried citizens past construction sites where the future was being built—one brick, one beam, one rail at a time. In the bustling markets, the Japanese yen exchanged hands alongside local produce, a tangible sign of the economic transformations taking place. Meanwhile, in the classrooms, children of diverse backgrounds recited lessons in Japanese, their voices blending into a melody of unity and change. And in the mines and factories, the hum of machinery provided a backdrop to the lives of those who toiled, not just for subsistence, but for the promise of a better tomorrow. The transformation of Formosa was a tapestry woven from countless threads—economic, educational, and cultural—each contributing to the creation of a province that stood as a testament to Japanese ambition and the resilience of its people."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on how the Japanese utilized the legacy of the Ming satellite state/rump kingdom of the absolute royal dynastic monarchy of the Japanese-Han Chinese side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Tungning/Tungning Kingdom in their [the Japanese's] administration of Formosa and also in the training of Han Chinese and Cantonese Ming restorationists there [Formosa].","output":"**Chapter XLIII: Echoes of Tungning** In a stately room within the administrative headquarters in Taipei, adorned with both the crisply designed flags of the rising sun of Japan and the symbolic emblems of the bygone Ming dynasty, Governor Ishikawa convened a highly confidential meeting. This gathering was unlike any other; it was charged with the spirit of historical legacies and the weight of future aspirations. Seated around Ishikawa were his trusted advisors, along with a select group of scholars well-versed in the history of Formosa and the exploits of Koxinga, the Ming loyalist who once established the Kingdom of Tungning as a bastion against Qing expansion. The aim was clear: to leverage this legacy in their governance of Formosa and bolster the training of Han Chinese and Cantonese Ming restorationists. \\"History,\\" Ishikawa began, clearing his throat, \\"is not merely a record of the past but a beacon for the future. The Royal House of Koxinga and its stand against the Qing resonates deeply with our current objectives. We must draw upon this legacy to strengthen our position and inspire the Ming restorationist movement.\\" A scholar, Professor Watanabe, adjusted his glasses before speaking. \\"Indeed, Governor. Koxinga's legacy is a potent symbol of resistance and determinism. His Royal House, though rooted in the Ming dynasty, was innovative and forward-thinking, much like our aspirations for Formosa. By invoking his spirit, we link our governance with an era revered by many Han Chinese and Cantonese.\\" A military advisor, Colonel Sato, leaned forward, interlocking his fingers. \\"The training of Han Chinese and Cantonese Ming restorationists on Formosa can thus be framed as a continuation of Koxinga's resistance. It's not merely military strategy we're imparting, but a lineage of defiance and autonomy.\\" Ishikawa nodded thoughtfully. \\"This approach requires a careful blending of narratives. While we promote the technological and administrative advancements of the Japanese Empire, we must also pay homage to the resilience and autonomy characterized by the Tungning Kingdom.\\" A quiet murmur of agreement swept the room, signaling the collective understanding of the delicate task ahead. A cultural envoy, Miss Hayashi, raised a pertinent question. \\"How do we ensure that the legacy of Koxinga, and by extension, the Ming, does not overshadow the sovereignty and vision of the Japanese Empire?\\" Governor Ishikawa contemplated this before responding. \\"By presenting the Japanese Empire as the catalyst for the realization of Koxinga's unfinished dream. We are not supplanting his legacy; we are its culmination. The technologies, reforms, and values we introduce are the means by which the spirit of the Ming, through Tungning, achieves its full potential.\\" Colonel Sato added, \\"Our military academies in Formosa should emphasize this narrative in their curriculum for the Ming restorationists. They must understand that in aligning with us, they are not betraying their heritage but fulfilling a centuries-old quest for autonomy against the Qing.\\" Professor Watanabe interjected, \\"This synthesis of cultures and objectives also provides a unique opportunity to study and document the transitional period Formosa is undergoing. It could serve as a blueprint for similar endeavors in the future.\\" Ishikawa, satisfied with the strategic direction charted by the meeting, concluded, \\"Let us proceed with diligence and respect for the complexities of this task. Our administration of Formosa, coupled with the training of restorationists, must be a testament to the union of past valor and present vision.\\" As the participants dispersed, they were acutely aware of the historical crossroads at which they stood. The endeavor they were about to embark upon was not merely an administrative or military exercise but a renaissance that sought to bridge epochs, cultures, and aspirations.

The cherry blossoms were in full bloom, painting the sky with hues of pink and white, a gentle reminder of the beauty and impermanence of power. Inside a carefully arranged drawing-room, representatives of Japan's most esteemed families, the Kazoku, the Tokugawa clan, and members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato, gathered alongside the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty and the Ming aristocracy. The air was thick with the anticipation of a momentous occasion—the integration of these storied lineages into the very fabric of the Japanese ruling elite through a series of strategic unions. Governor Ishikawa, having overseen the transformation of Formosa, was present to facilitate the discussions, recognizing the delicate balance of honor, tradition, and political acumen required. \\"Esteemed members of our noble houses,\\" began Ishikawa, his voice resonant and measured, \\"today, we stand on the cusp of an alliance that transcends mere geopolitics.

The Royal House of Koxinga has always stood for resilience in the face of adversity, a value deeply resonant with the Samurai spirit.\\" From the Kazoku, a prominent noble, Lord Fujimura, inclined his head in acknowledgment. \\"The integration of the Ming and Zheng descendants into our ranks is not only a gesture of unity but a testament to our vision for the future. Their bloodlines carry the wisdom of ages, a priceless boon to the Kazoku and, by extension, to Japan.\\" A matron of the Tokugawa clan, renowned for her diplomatic finesse, added, \\"Through intermarriage and the bonds of kinship, we shall fortify our families—not merely in terms of power but in the richness of culture and knowledge exchanged. It's a confluence of destinies, ushering in an era of unparalleled prosperity and understanding.\\" Governor Ishikawa nodded, turning to a young princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato, whose marriage to a Ming descendant was poised to symbolize the dawn of this new era. \\"Princess Miyako, your union is the cornerstone of this grand mosaic we endeavor to create. Would you grace us with your thoughts?\\" Princess Miyako, her demeanor reflecting the weight of her role, spoke softly yet with conviction. \\"I am humbled by the path laid out before me. This alliance, born of mutual respect and shared aspirations, signifies more than the merging of lineages. It's a pledge to honor the sacrifices of our ancestors and to shoulder the legacy they've bestowed upon us—a legacy of unity, strength, and enduring peace.\\" Murmurs of approval resonated through the room, as the assembly acknowledged the significance of her words. \\"As we proceed with these unions,\\" Ishikawa concluded, \\"let us be mindful of the history we are crafting—a saga of integration that celebrates diversity and fosters a sense of belonging among all our people, regardless of their origin. May the prosperity of our families reflect the prosperity of Japan and ensure that the legacy of the Ming, the Zheng, and the illustrious Japanese Empire endure for generations.\\" The meeting adjourned with a sense of shared purpose, as plans for weddings and ceremonies began to take shape.

At the head of the grand, lacquered table sat Prince Uihwa, a figure of youthful ambition, flanked by Japanese Governor Ishikawa and representatives from the newly formed Korean Kazoku, adorned in robes that signified their noble status. The echo of Gojong’s rule had faded, giving rise to a new era, a decision orchestrated by the Japanese with a nuanced understanding of Korean politics and societal structures.

The introduction of steam-powered artillery and mechanized infantry units, trained in combined arms warfare, promises a level of martial proficiency unprecedented in this region.\\" A pause followed, the weight of their collective responsibility hanging heavily in the air. It was then that a political advisor, Minister Park, addressed the assembly, shifting the focus to a more contentious aspect of their nation-building efforts. \\"Generals, Admirals, while we fortify our military, we must also address the internal dissent that threatens to undermine our Empire's unity,\\" he said, with a note of urgency in his voice. \\"The deportation of the anti-Japanese, China-supporting yangaban to the Great Qing Empire—a move designed to stir Ming revivalism and Han nationalism—must be executed with precision and care.\\" General Hwang nodded solemnly, \\"Indeed, Minister Park. This act, while decisive, must not be seen as mere retribution but as a necessary step towards the stabilization and security of our Empire. Each yangaban sent to the Qing lands carries with them a message—that the Korean Empire is committed to its sovereignty and its allies.\\" Admiral Yamada interjected thoughtfully, \\"Simultaneously, this act serves to kindle the flames of dissent within the Qing, diverting their attention inward. The resurgence of Ming revivalism, fueled by the presence of these yangaban, could preoccupy the Qing sufficiently to ease our own path towards strengthening.\\" Minister Park leaned back, acknowledging the points made. \\"Strategically, it is a sound maneuver. Yet, we must remain vigilant. The repercussions of these deportations will echo beyond our borders, and we must be prepared for the diplomatic challenges that follow.\\" General Takahashi, ever focused on the practicalities, concluded, \\"Our priority remains the defense and development of the Korean Empire. Together, with the might of our combined forces and the wisdom of our strategies, we shall navigate these complexities.\\" As the meeting adjourned, the gathered minds set about translating their deliberations into decisive action.

Arrayed against them, the formidable silhouette of the Imperial Russian Navy loomed, a leviathan stirring from the depths of European Russia, its sights set on asserting dominance over the Far East. Admiral Matsura stood on the bridge of the *Mikasa*, the IJN's flagship, as he surveyed the impending clash of empires. Beside him, Admiral Cho of the Korean Empire, a testament to the alliance forged in fire and ambition, shared the weight of the moment. \\"The Russians underestimate our resolve,\\" Matsura began, his eyes narrowing as he watched the enemy fleet maneuver. \\"Their ships are powerful, but our strategy and technology will secure our victory.

Japanese and Korean shells sliced through the morning fog, answered in kind by the thunderous replies of the Russian guns. Amid the chaos of battle, the samurai units, a fearsome sight in their armor, prepared for their role in the upcoming landings. Their ancient warrior spirit, now allied with the cutting edge of military technology, made them a formidable force. The Imperial Russian Air Service took to the skies, their airships lumbering towards the Japanese and Korean positions, dropping bombs in an effort to break their formation. The IJN responded with their own air contingents, engaging in dogfights that dotted the clouds with fire and smoke. Admiral Matsura, seizing the moment, ordered a flanking maneuver. \\"Now! While their focus is divided!\\" The *Mikasa*, leading a contingent of faster, more maneuverable ships, cut through the Russian lines, delivering a crippling blow to the *Tsarevich*. On land, the echoes of naval artillery were the harbingers of the amphibious assault to come. The IJA and Imperial Korean Army, supported by the samurai, began their landings under the cover of smoke and confusion. The Imperial Russian Army, entrenched along the coast, met them with volleys of fire, but the element of surprise and the ferocity of the attackers gained them a foothold. As the day wore on, the Sea of Japan became a tableau of destruction and valor. Ships grappled in a deadly dance, while above them, airships and aeroplanes clashed in the new theater of aerial combat. Admiral Rozhestvensky, witnessing the tenacity of the Japanese and Korean forces and the unexpected efficiency of their tactics and technology, realized the battle was slipping from his grasp. \\"Signal a retreat,\\" he ordered grimly. \\"We must regroup and reassess.

Within the confines of a fortified command center near the city of Dalian, a huddle of military minds from the Japanese Empire, the Korean Empire, and loyalists from the Qing's New Army and Beiyang Navy, orchestrated the defense against an imposing threat—the combined forces of the Imperial Russian Army (IRA) and its formidable navy and air service. General Yamada, overseeing the defenses, addressed the assembly with a map of Manchuria spread before them. \\"The Russian Empire seeks to break our will by seizing Manchuria. They believe that by crushing us here, they can dictate the terms of peace. We must prove them wrong.\\" Captain Lee, representing the Imperial Korean Army (IKA) units deployed in Manchuria, chimed in, \\"The Korean brigades stand ready. Our soldiers remember the harshness of Qing rule and will fight to ensure our new-found autonomy is not threatened.\\" Admiral Zhou of the Beiyang Navy, his features set in a grim determination, added, \\"Our naval guns have been positioned along the coast. Although the Russian Baltic Fleet poses a significant threat, we are prepared to defend our waters with every shell at our disposal.\\" General Yamada nodded before continuing, \\"The Kwangtung Army, alongside our Korean allies and the forces of the New Army and Beiyang Navy, forms a formidable wall. But it is our strategy that will ensure our victory. The Russians underestimate the mobility of our forces and our ability to strike from unexpected quarters.\\" The room fell silent as the aerogram officer entered, handing a message to General Yamada. After a brief pause to read the contents, Yamada's eyes hardened. \\"The Imperial Russian Air Service (IRAS) has begun its assault. They aim to break our supply lines and isolate our forces.\\" Field Marshal Tan, the chief strategist from the Qing's New Army, leaned forward. \\"Let us turn their strategy against them. Our understanding of this terrain allows us to lure them into traps. Guerrilla tactics, combined with the precision strikes by our steam-powered aircraft, can whittle down their strength.\\" Admiral Zhou suggested, \\"And let us not forget the power of misinformation. Feeding the Russians false intelligence about our positions and strength could lead them into a tactical blunder.\\" As the plans took shape, a spirit of unity pervaded the room. Traditional rivalries and past grievances gave way to a singular focus—defending Manchuria against the onslaught. --- The battles that ensued were fierce and unforgiving. Russian advances met stubborn resistance, with every inch of ground contested by the defenders. In the skies, the IRAS encountered a swarm of agile, steam-powered fighters that harried their bombers and reconnaissance planes, reducing their effectiveness. On the ground, the IRA found itself bogged down by a combination of harsh weather, determined guerrilla attacks, and carefully orchestrated counteroffensives. Manchurian villages, once quiet, became battlegrounds where the local populace, inspired by the resistance, lent their support however they could. The Siege of Manchuria, as it came to be known, marked a turning point in the Russo-Japanese War. Despite their numerical and firepower superiority, the Russian forces were unable to achieve a decisive breakthrough. Each attempt was repelled with cunning and bravery by an alliance forged in the fires of conflict—an alliance that, despite its diverse composition, stood united in the face of a common enemy. In the aftermath, as reports of the determined defense reached the capitals of the warring nations, the world took note. Manchuria had become a symbol of resistance, a testament to the resolve of the Japanese, Koreans, and their allies from the Qing's remaining loyal forces. The battles fought in its forests and along its rivers would long be remembered, not just for their military significance, but for the message they sent—a message of defiance, unity, and the enduring spirit of those who fought for their land and their future."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on the peace treaty between the Russian Empire and the Great Japanese Empire, the Korean Empire and the Great Qing Empire that ends the Second Sino-Japanese War, confirming the Korean Empire's and Manchuria's shared status as Japanese protectorates and ending Russian influence in East Asia.","output":"**Chapter LX: The Treaty of Kyoto** The great hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace had been chosen as the venue for a momentous occasion, the likes of which had not been seen in the modern age. Flags of the involved nations stood side by side, symbolizing a cautious camaraderie forged in the aftermath of conflict. The leaders of the Great Japanese Empire, the Korean Empire, and the beleaguered representatives from the Russian Empire and the Great Qing Empire gathered to finalize a peace treaty that would redraw the geopolitical landscape of East Asia. General Yamada, the esteemed Japanese military strategist, sat across from Count Alexei, the chief Russian envoy, their expressions betraying the gravity of the negotiations that had preceded this day. Emperor Meiji of Japan and Emperor Sunjong of the Korean Empire exchanged glances, a silent acknowledgment of their shared victories and sacrifices. Count Alexei cleared his throat, breaking the palpable tension, \\"We, the representatives of the Russian Empire, come to this table in a spirit of reconciliation. The valor displayed by the forces of Japan and Korea has not gone unnoticed, and we seek a lasting peace.\\" General Yamada responded, his tone firm yet diplomatic, \\"The Great Japanese Empire values the courage of all who fought.

It is a testament to our resolve to ensure the stability and prosperity of East Asia, free from external interference.\\" Emperor Sunjong, nodding in agreement, added, \\"The Korean Empire, reborn through the flames of war, stands committed to fostering peace with its neighbors under the protection of Japan. Together, we shall stride towards a promising future.\\" The Qing representative, a dignified elder named Minister Li, who had watched his empire's influence wane, spoke next. \\"The Great Qing Empire recognizes the new balance of power in East Asia. In the spirit of peace, we shall respect the terms set forth in this treaty.\\" Count Alexei then formally announced the Russian Empire's concession, \\"In acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by all sides, the Russian Empire will relinquish its claims and influence in Manchuria and Korea, focusing henceforth on strengthening the bonds of peace and cooperation with our neighbors to the east.\\" General Yamada, turning to a page in the document that lay before him, delineated the final, crucial terms, \\"Furthermore, this treaty establishes a framework for economic and cultural exchanges, ensuring that the scars of war give way to bridges of understanding and growth.\\" As each representative affixed their signature to the treaty, a collective sigh of relief filled the room, followed by a cautious optimism. The Treaty of Kyoto, as it would be known to history, was not merely an agreement between nations; it was a declaration of a collective aspiration for a world governed by principles of sovereignty, respect, and mutual development. Outside, beneath the expansive sky, the city of Kyoto bore witness to the dawn of a new chapter in East Asian history. The echoes of the past, with its turbulence and strife, slowly receded, as the peoples of Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and even the distant lands of Russia and the Qing Empire, looked forward to forging a path of peace and prosperity. The Treaty of Kyoto, hence, stood not just as a monument to the resolution of the Russo-Japanese War but as a beacon of hope—a hope that diplomacy and understanding might prevail over the specters of war and conquest in the years to come."},{"instruction":"What shows do most kids watch on YouTube","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, kids' viewing habits on YouTube are incredibly diverse, encompassing a wide range of content from unboxing videos and toy reviews to educational content and episodes or clips from popular kids' TV shows.

I don't want a raycast to collide with a wall whose normal is facing away from the raycast direction. How can I account for this programmically? Would the dot product help here","output":"Yes, using the dot product can indeed help you determine whether a ray should collide with a wall depending on the direction the wall's normal is facing relative to the raycast's direction. This technique is rooted in understanding how dot products can indicate the angle between two vectors. In 3D programming and game development, a raycast typically has a starting point and a direction. Similarly, a surface (like your wall) has a normal vector that points perpendicularly away from its face. The angle between the ray's direction and the wall's normal can decide if the ray should \\"see\\" the wall or not. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can use the dot product for this purpose: # Understanding the Dot Product The dot product of two vectors **A** and **B** is calculated as: [ text{Dot}(A, B) = ||A|| times ||B|| times cos(theta) ] Where: - ( ||A|| ) and ( ||B|| ) are the magnitudes (lengths) of vectors **A** and **B**, - ( cos(theta) ) is the cosine of the angle ( theta ) between **A** and **B**. The key part to note is that the dot product can tell us about the angle between two vectors: - If the dot product is positive, the angle ( theta ) between **A** and **B** is less than 90 degrees. - If the dot product is zero, the vectors are perpendicular. - If the dot product is negative, the angle ( theta ) is greater than 90 degrees. # Applying to Your Scenario Given: - **N** is the normalized vector normal to the wall, - **D** is the normalized direction vector of the ray. Calculate the dot product ( text{Dot}(N, D) ). You can decide on how to handle the collision based on the sign of this value. # Implementation Concept (Pseudocode) \`\`\`cpp Vector3 wallNormal = GetWallNormal(); // Normal vector of the wall Vector3 rayDirection = GetRayDirection(); // Direction vector of the ray // Assuming both vectors are normalized. If not, normalize them before proceeding. float dot = DotProduct(wallNormal, rayDirection); if(dot < 0){ // The wall's normal is facing towards the ray, indicating potential visibility or collision // Proceed with handling the collision } else{ // The wall's normal is facing away from the ray, ignore the collision } \`\`\` # Dot Product Function (If Needed) Here's a simple dot product function example if you're implementing from scratch: \`\`\`cpp float DotProduct(Vector3 a, Vector3 b) { return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z * b.z; } \`\`\` This method ensures your raycast system respects the orientation of walls, allowing for more physically accurate simulations or game mechanics. It efficiently filters out walls that should be invisible or non-collidable based on their facing direction relative to the ray."},{"instruction":"Write a Chaotic story where Tom accidentally sets all the monsters from Perim into Earth, is threatened with account termination and bumps into a allergic kid who happens to see monsters (This is a crossover story)","output":"In the quiet room lit only by the flickering light of a computer screen, Tom's fingers danced with a nervous energy over the keyboard. His focus was unyielding, locked onto the screen displaying the world of Perim, a realm where chaotic monsters roamed wild and battles determined fate. But as every avid player of Chaotic knows, crossing the line between Perim and Earth was a forbidden act, an unwritten rule. Tonight, driven by curiosity and a hacker's pride, Tom was about to break that rule. Typing in a complex sequence of commands, Tom initiated an algorithm that was supposed to let him access Perim's creatures in augmented reality, bringing them to life right in his room. With anticipation building inside him, he watched as the computer executed the commands. Then, there was a spark, not just from the computer, but from reality itself. The room vibrated with an unseen energy, and in an instant, it wasn't just his room. Monsters from Perim, in all their terrifying glory, began to pour into Earth's reality at an exponential rate. As Tom looked on in horror, realizing the magnitude of his mistake, a digital window popped up on his screen: **WARNING: Unauthorized Cross-Reality Breach Detected. Your account is subject to IMMEDIATE termination.** But the digital threat paled in comparison to the real-world chaos that Tom had unleashed. Creatures of every shape and size roamed the streets, causing pandemonium. Tom, feeling a surge of responsibility amidst his fear, knew he had to find a way to revert the chaos. In a desperate bid, Tom ran out into the crowded streets, his mind racing with possible solutions. That's when he quite literally bumped into Alex, a scrawny kid with glasses too big for his face, sneezing uncontrollably. \\"Are you okay?\\" Tom asked, more out of civility than genuine concern at the moment. Alex looked up at him with watery eyes, \\"Allergies...but did you see it? The monster?\\" He sniffed. \\"I always see them, but today everyone else can too.\\" Tom's heart skipped a beat. This kid, allergic and apparently capable of seeing monsters even before the breach, could be the key to fixing everything. \\"Listen, I need your help. I know this is going to sound crazy, but—\\" \\"Crazy?\\" Alex interrupted. \\"Dude, with Raznus walking down Main Street, I don't think 'crazy' is in today's vocabulary.\\" Together, they concocted a plan. Using Alex's unique ability to see monsters and Tom's knowledge of Perim's creatures, they decided to lure the monsters into a digital trap Tom could construct if he could regain access to his Chaotic account. Breaking into a run, they headed towards Tom's house, dodging havoc and monsters alike. Tom's mind was racing, not just with fear and adrenaline, but with codes and algorithms that might just reverse his catastrophic mistake. Reaching his computer, Tom began to program furiously, his fingers once again dancing over the keys. Meanwhile, Alex, in an odd display of courage, leaned out the window, shouting and sneezing to attract the attention of nearby monsters, guiding them towards their location. Just as a particularly large creature loomed over their safe haven, threatening to shatter it to pieces, Tom hit the enter key. The world seemed to hold its breath. And then, one by one, the monsters began to vanish, sucked back into the digital realm of Perim. Exhaustion overcame them as the last echoes of chaos faded. The digital warning on Tom's screen blinked out, replaced by a message: **Account Status: Under Review. We hope you've learned from this experience, [User].** Tom let out a long breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. He looked over at Alex, managing a weak smile. \\"Thanks,\\" he said. \\"You saved us.\\" Alex simply nodded, already in the throes of another sneezing fit. But through the incessant sneezes, a grin was clear on his face. Together, they had averted a disaster that would have surely rewritten the boundaries between worlds. Yet, in the quiet aftermath, both understood that the line between reality and the digital world should never be crossed again. And Tom, with a newfound respect for the monsters of Perim, realized that some things are better left within the confines of screens and imagination."},{"instruction":"Dot product difference in 2 vs 3 dimensions","output":"The dot product, also known as the scalar product, is a fundamental operation in vector algebra. It takes two vectors and returns a scalar (a number, not a vector) that reflects the degree to which the vectors align with each other. The dot product can be calculated in any number of dimensions, but here we'll focus on its application in 2 and 3 dimensions. # In 2 Dimensions For vectors **A** = (a₁, a₂) and **B** = (b₁, b₂) in a 2-dimensional space, the dot product is calculated using the formula: **A** ⋅ **B** = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ This formula effectively multiplies each component of the vectors together (a₁ with b₁, and a₂ with b₂) and then adds these products. # In 3 Dimensions For vectors **A** = (a₁, a₂, a₃) and **B** = (b₁, b₂, b₃) in a 3-dimensional space, the dot product formula is extended to account for the additional dimension: **A** ⋅ **B** = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + a₃b₃ So, in addition to the multiplications and addition of the components in the first two dimensions, you also multiply the third components (a₃ and b₃) and add this to the sum. # Difference Between 2 and 3 Dimensions The key difference between calculating the dot product in 2 and 3 dimensions is simply the consideration of an extra component in each vector when in 3 dimensions. You're adding one more term to the sum (a₃b₃). Conceptually, however, the operation is essentially the same across dimensions: you're multiplying corresponding components of the vectors and adding those products together. The result, in both 2D and 3D, gives you a measure of how much the vectors align. When the dot product is positive, it means the vectors have a component in the same direction; when negative, it indicates they point in opposite directions; and when zero, it means the vectors are perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other, having no component of one in the direction of the other. Regardless of the dimension, the geometric interpretation of the dot product can also be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the vectors (**|A|** and **|B|**) and the cosine of the angle (θ) between them: **A** ⋅ **B** = **|A|** **|B|** cos(θ). This interpretation remains valid and is consistent across any number of dimensions, highlighting the dot product's role in understanding the geometric and algebraic properties of vectors in multidimensional spaces."},{"instruction":"Write a story in Chaotic where Tom and Kaz accidentally port the Perim creatures into Earth, the CodeMasters threaten to ban both of them, and they bump into an allergic kid who is frequently called Zick, who can see monsters (This is a crossover story btw)","output":"In the heart of the chaotic hustle and bustle of a small, seemingly ordinary town, Tom and Kaz, two avid players of the Chaotic trading card game, found themselves embroiled in an adventure beyond their wildest dreams. Known for diving deep into the world of Perim through the virtual reality portals in their game, they had never imagined that their actions would blend the boundaries between two worlds. One evening, as the purple hue of twilight enveloped the sky, Tom and Kaz huddled together in Kaz's basement, surrounded by their extensive collection of Chaotic cards and memorabilia. They were attempting something no one in their world had tried before - to augment the connection between Earth and Perim, enhancing their gaming experience to unprecedented levels. However, their experiment took a dramatic turn when they inadvertently created a portal that did not just allow them to visit Perim, but also allowed its creatures to cross over into Earth. As the first of the Perim creatures emerged, a towering, fearsome creature with eyes gleaming in the dim light of the basement, Tom and Kaz realized the gravity of their mistake. The creature, although bewildered, was just the first of many. Soon, their quiet town was teeming with creatures of all shapes and sizes, from the majestic OverWorlders to the cunning UnderWorlders, turning their world upside down. Panic ensued among the townsfolk, with reports of bizarre creatures popping up all over town. Amidst this chaos, the CodeMasters, the legendary overseers of the Chaotic world, intervened. They appeared before Tom and Kaz, their expressions stern and unforgiving, threatening to ban them from Chaotic for endangering both worlds with their recklessness. Just when things couldn't seem any more dire, Tom and Kaz bumped into a peculiar kid known to the town as Zick. Zick was an odd one, frequently seen chatting away to thin air or sneezing uncontrollably for no apparent reason. It was rumored he was allergic to just about everything. However, the truth was far more incredible; Zick could see monsters. Unseen by ordinary humans, these monsters were as real to Zick as the nose on his face, and now, he was witnessing an inexplicable surge in their numbers. The trio, an unlikely gathering of heroes, found themselves bound together by fate to resolve the crisis at hand. With the combined abilities of Tom and Kaz's knowledge of the Perim creatures and Zick's unique sight, they embarked on a mission to send the creatures back to their world before the CodeMasters' ban came into effect. Their journey was fraught with challenges, as they navigated through a town now riddled with chaos. With each creature they encountered, Zick's allergies acted as a bizarre compass, guiding them towards their targets. They faced fierce battles, forged unexpected alliances, and learned invaluable lessons about responsibility and friendship. In the end, through a daring plan that utilized the very portal they had mistakenly created, Tom, Kaz, and Zick managed to return the Perim creatures to their rightful world. The CodeMasters, impressed by their resolve and the bravery they displayed, decided to spare them the ban, with a stern warning about the dangers of meddling with forces beyond their understanding.

He is also known for his numerous allergies, some of which are triggered by the monsters themselves. Congratulations on identifying them! In the world of storytelling, merging these two universes brings about a unique narrative that combines the adventurous and fantastical elements of both franchises."},{"instruction":"Your prize is free hugs (virtural)","output":"Thank you!

Unbeknownst to Tom, Kaz, and Zick, they too were grappling with the consequences of the portal's activation but from a different angle. Sarah and Peyton, ever the resourceful duo, were initially caught off-guard by the appearance of Perim creatures. However, they quickly adapted to the situation. Recognizing the gravity of what had transpired, they embarked on a mission to maintain a semblance of order amidst the chaos. Their journey led them to coordinate with local authorities and the Chaotic community, disseminating information on how to peacefully coexist with the Perim creatures while a solution was being sought. While Peyton utilized his in-depth knowledge of the creatures to advise on non-confrontational interaction, Sarah took charge of logistics, making sure that the townspeople had access to safe shelters and resources. Their swift and effective response played a crucial role in preventing panic and ensuring that both humans and creatures remained unharmed during this tumultuous time. On the other side of the adventure, and perhaps in a different dimension of trouble altogether, was Elena Potato from the Monster Allergy universe. Unaware of the convergence occurring in Tom and Kaz's world, Elena faced her own set of challenges. With Zick suddenly gone, she found herself at the forefront of handling monster-related issues in Oldmill Village. Elena, possessing a strong and courageous spirit, rose to the challenge. She worked closely with Timothy-Moth, Zick's loyal talking cat, to manage the surge in monster activity, which had unexpectedly increased perhaps due to the rippling effects of the portal's activation. Without knowing the source of the upheaval, Elena relied on her wit, her growing understanding of the monster world, and her steadfast determination to protect her town. While these adventures unfolded separately, they were intrinsically linked by the chaos ensuing from the portal's opening. Sarah and Peyton in one town and Elena in another demonstrated impressive resilience and leadership. Their efforts, though unbeknownst to each other, were parallel battles in a war against a shared, albeit unknowingly, adversary. In the end, as Tom, Kaz, and Zick worked to resolve the crisis at its core, the valiant endeavors of Sarah, Peyton, and Elena ensured that their worlds remained intact, setting the stage for an eventual reunion where tales of their separate adventures would be shared in awe and laughter, highlighting the strength found in friendship and unity even when faced with the most unpredictable of circumstances."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[역시 가르친 보람이 있어.] 민국이는 첫 발걸음을 떼는 게 어려워서 그렇지 첫 발걸음만 뗐다 하면 뭐든 잘해냈다. 연기도 그랬고, 한글도 그랬다. 어느새 보쌈을 먹은 구성현 부장과 여자가 일어섰다. “사장님, 계산이요.” “잘 드셨어요?” “네, 아주 맛있게 먹었네요. 직원들도 좋아할 것 같아요.” 구성현 부장은 방긋 웃으며 포장된 보쌈까지 야무지게 챙겼다. [구성현. 제법 입맛이 까다로운 사람인데, 맛있다고 할 정도면 어느 정도 인정받은 건가. 서비스 점수라도 더 챙겨야지.] 나는 얼른 조르르 달려가서 구성현 부장과 여자에게 인사를 했다. “안녕히 가세요. 또 와주세요.” “응. 또 올게. 사장님, 아드님 정말 잘 키우셨네요.” “감사합니다. 또 오세요.” “네에.” 구성현 부장과 여자는 가게 문을 열고 나갔다. 아빠가 환하게 웃으며 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 공부하기도 바쁠 텐데 아빠 가게까지 나와서 고생이 많아. 아빠가 저녁으로 보쌈 싸줄 테니까, 엄마랑 가서 맛있게 먹어.” “녜에!” 나는 오랜만에 어깨춤도 춰줬다. “그나저나 심사위원들 우리 집은 빼먹었나. 왜 심사위원 같은 사람들은 안 오나 몰라.” [아빠, 좀 전의 그 사람들이 효진 그룹 심사위원들이야. 아빠, 제발 눈치 좀!] “성국아, 아빠 떨어졌나 보다.” “아빠, 붙을 거야. 꼭!” “역시 아들밖에 없구나.” 아빠는 나를 안아 들었다. * * * 김미영이 아침부터 일찍 집에 방문했다. 오늘은 바로 민국이의 밥벌이 기회를 잡을 오디션 날이기 때문이다. 나는 아침 일찍 일어나서 배부른 엄마 대신 민국이를 씻기고 머리도 빗겼다. “형아, 여기 여기.” 민국이는 머리를 이리저리 쓸어 올리며 신경을 썼다. “밍구가, 형아 청담동에서 머리하던 사람이야. 가만히 좀 있어.” “응.” 김미영이 가방을 챙기더니 우리를 봤다. “성국이가 민국이 참 잘 챙기네요.” 이때, 엄마가 부른 배를 잡고 걸어 나왔다. “언니, 송혜선 씨가 다른 소속사 접촉하고 있다는데… 걱정이네요. 임선미도 잠정적 은퇴 상황이고, 아역 배우들은 활동, 한계가 있잖아요.” “성국이 엄마. 우리 원래 성국이 은퇴할 때까지만 이 일 하다가 접으려고 했잖아요. 여기까지 온 것도 정말 대단한 거죠.” “그렇긴 해도… 아깝잖아요. 그동안 사업도 잘됐고.” “성국이랑 임선미 덕분에 자리 잡았지만, 이 일 그만둔다고 우리 이제 굶어 죽는 거 아니잖아요.” [무슨 소리야? 매니지먼트를 그만둔다고?] 나는 김미영을 쳐다봤다. “절대 안 돼!” 내 소리에 놀란 김미영과 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “내가 할 거예요. 회사 내가 할 거라고요.” 나는 단호하게 말했다. “성국아, 넌 내년이면 유학 갈 거잖아.” “유학 다녀와서 할 거라고요! 회사!” 나는 주먹을 앙 쥐었다. 김미영이 고개를 끄덕였다. “그래, 이 일은 어쩌면 성국이 덕분에 시작한 일이니까 성국이 의사가 제일 중요하지. 우리도 좀 더 내실 있는 배우들 위주로 팀을 다시 꾸려보는 거 생각해봐요.” “아니요!” 나는 고개를 저었다. “성국아, 배우들 말고 뭐?” “아이돌!” “아이돌?” “네에. 아이돌 그룹을 만들어야 해요.” 이제 앞으로 대한민국 연예계는 아이돌이 움직인다. 이미 자리 잡은 ST를 비롯한 수많은 기획사들이 아이돌 그룹을 키워내고, 대한민국은 K-POP 열풍을 일으킨다. 삼전 그룹에 있을 당시 연예 기획사에 관심이 있어서 시스템과 교육과정을 훑어본 적이 있었다. “성국아, 음악 쪽은 우리가 잘 몰라서….” 김미영이 난색을 표했다. “흠…. 조금만 기다려 주세요. 제가 공부하고 와서 꼭 아이돌 그룹 만들 거예요.” “그래, 알았어. 성국아, 우선은 오늘 민국이 데리고 오디션장 가자.” [진짜 어서 크고 싶다. 쑥쑥.] * * * 민국이가 오디션을 볼 배역은 16부작 미니시리즈의 주인공 부부 아들이었다. 주인공 부부가 아들을 두고 이혼했다가 다시 만난다는 그렇고 그런 이야기였다. 나는 대기실에 앉아 아이들을 매의 눈으로 살폈다. [이 중에 나중에 좀 눈여겨볼 만한 얼굴들이 있나.] 다들 눈만 동그랗게 큰 개성 없는 얼굴이었다. 민국이는 옆에서 열심히 대본을 읽고 또 읽었다. 나는 민국이 엉덩이를 토닥거렸다. [그래, 머리가 나쁘면 열심히 해야 하는 거야.] 민국이는 나를 한번 보고 씨익 웃더니 대본을 또 읽고 또 읽었다. “아빠. 아빠, 오늘 밤 나 아빠랑 엄마랑 손잡고.” “민국아. 여기에 좀 더 애절한 감정을 섞어봐야지. 엄마랑 아빠랑 네 곁에서 안 자고, 이제 너 혼자 잔다고 생각을 해봐.” “히잉. 밍구기 시로.” “그치? 그 감정을 이 대사에 녹여내.” “응, 형아.” 내가 민국이를 지도하는 사이에 한 명의 남자아이가 들어왔다. 내 또래로 보이는 남자아이는 꽤 익숙한 얼굴이었다. 바로 내 인생의 첫 경쟁자였던 덕풍 제지의 손자 이재희였다. 민국이의 첫 오디션 때 내가 도와준 덕분에 작은 배역을 맡고는 그 뒤로 간간이 배역을 맡는 것 같았다. 이재희의 곁에는 늘 보이던 엄마가 보이지 않았다. 대신 젊은 여자가 보였다. [소속사 들어간 건가….] 나는 민국이를 두고 이재희에게 다가갔다. “재희야, 나 기억해?” 해맑게 웃으며 접근했지만, 이재희는 경계의 눈빛으로 나를 봤다. “난 동생 오디션 따라왔어.” [이재희, 넌 내 경쟁자가 절대 될 수 없어. 난 이제 아역 은퇴했다고.] 이재희는 그때서야 눈빛을 풀고 알은척을 했다. “어, 안녕. 성국이 맞지? 오랜만이야.” “기억하네.” “응. 덕분에 오디션 붙었잖아.” [돌머리는 아니군. 상황 파악 제대로 하는 것 보니.] 나는 얼른 젊은 여자에게도 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “어머, 네가 그 유명한 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 성국이구나.” “저는 잘 기억이 안 나요. 어릴 적이라서요.” “나 완전 너 팬이었어.” 여자는 얼른 지갑을 열더니 명함을 한 장 내밀었다. “아직도 아역 하니?” “지금은 안 해요.” “아쉽네. 이건 내 명함이야.” 나는 한눈에 기획사 이름을 기억해냈다. 신성 기획. 바로 신성중이 있던 기획사였다. “재희도 우리 신성 기획 소속이야.” [쯧쯧, 보나 마나 노예 계약일 텐데.] 씁쓸한 마음이 들었다. 이때, 김미영이 뒤에서 다가왔다. “안녕하세요. 성국이 담당하고 있는 SKJ 김미영 대표입니다.” “전 신성 기획 아역 담당 이주미입니다. 반갑습니다.” 두 사람이 대화를 나누는 사이에 나는 얼른 이재희에게 속삭였다. “신성 기획이랑 얼마나 계약했어?” “7년.” “그렇게 오래?” “근데 일도 잘 안 잡아주고, 난 완전 찬밥이야.” “흠… 재희야, 신성 기획이랑 계약 끝나면 날 찾아와.” 이재희의 눈이 동그래졌다. 이재희는 그사이 키도 제법 크고 얼굴에 젖살도 빠졌다. 아주 잘생긴 얼굴은 아니었지만, 호감 가는 얼굴이었다. 이재희는 순진하게 물었다. “성국아, 널 찾아가면 뭐가 있어?” “너희 집 망했다며?” 이재희의 눈빛이 곧 어두워졌다. “응.” “어머니는?” “엄마는 일하러 다니셔. 맨날 다리가 아프시대. 내가 얼른 돈 벌어 우리 엄마 호강시켜 드려야 해.” 그동안 사정은 더 나빠진 것 같았다. 그나마 다행인 것은 재희의 어머니가 정신은 차린 모양이었다. “재희야, 아역 생활도 학교생활도 착실히 하고. 친구 골라 사귀고, 나쁜 애들이랑 어울리지 마. 괜한 사진 같은 것도 찍히지 말고. 그래야 나중에 연예인 생활 할 때 별 탈 없을 거야.” “노력할게.” “노력이 아니라 꼭 그래야 해. 알아들어?” “응.” 재희는 고개를 끄덕였다. “신성 기획이랑도 좋게 헤어지고. 집안 일으켜 세우고 싶으면, 7년 후에 나 찾아와.” “성국아, 널 어떻게 찾아가?” “SKJ 엔터테인먼트는 계속 있을 거니까, 꼭 찾아와.” “응. 꼭 찾아갈게.” 이때, 이주미가 이재희를 불렀다. “재희야, 다음 네 차례야. 대사 다 외웠지?” “네에.” 이재희는 자리에서 일어나며 나를 잡았다. “성국아, 고마워.” “7년 후에 보자.” “응.” 이재희는 한결 밝은 얼굴로 오디션장으로 들어갔다. “형아!” 뒤에서 민국이가 나를 찾았다. “형아! 형아! 민국이 응아!” [하아.] 민국이는 오디션장 들어가기 전에 응아를 하는 나쁜 버릇을 가지고 있었다. “알았어. 참아.” “못 참아, 형아!” 나는 얼른 민국이의 손을 잡고 화장실로 달려갔다. “형아, 바지. 어서! 나 급해!” 나는 얼른 민국이의 바지를 내렸다. 민국이는 변기에 앉자마자 곧 마음의 평화를 얻었다. “휴… 시원해엥.” 쏴아아-. 나는 코를 꽉 잡은 채 변기 물을 내렸다. [전민국, 너 오디션 떨어지면 죽을 줄 알아.]","output":"Episode 68 Director Gu Seong-hyeon looked into my eyes and started a conversation. \\"What's your name?\\" \\"Jeon Seong-guk~.\\" I answered rhythmically, like a child would. Director Gu Seong-hyeon smiled slightly, then opened his wallet and pulled out a ten-thousand-won note. \\"This is for helping your dad out. It's from me.\\" \\"It's okay. I'll just take your kind thoughts.\\" At my response, Gu Seong-hyeon burst into laughter. \\"You're not going to take it?\\" \\"Yes. I'm helping my dad, so I'll get my allowance from him.\\" \\"You're a smart kid. Mr. Owner, please pack three servings of bossam. I'll take them when I leave.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon cheerfully placed an additional order. I quickly went back to my seat and perked up my ears to listen to the conversation between Director Gu Seong-hyeon and the woman. \\"The place is cozy.\\" \\"The Sooyou branch is small too, but the taste is above average.\\" \\"The Sooyou branch seems to have gained some fame, but this place is small.\\" \\"Let's try the taste.\\" \\"Let's do that...\\" Just then, my dad came out with the bossam. Unaware of anything, my dad placed the bossam down as usual and explained. \\"The shrimp sauce is directly sourced by the owner's mother from Ganggyeong, where she runs a salted seafood business. Try it. It's different from what you buy in stores.\\" \\"Thank you. We'll enjoy it.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon politely greeted and started eating the bossam. My dad then came over to us and offered a drink. \\"Seong-guk, do you want some cider?\\" [Sigh, dad, just go into the kitchen. Don't loiter around and lose points unnecessarily.] I quickly pushed my dad into the kitchen. \\"Dad, go to the kitchen. We have guests.\\" \\"Alright, alright. So-young, since we have guests, keep an eye on the kids.\\" \\"Okay. Don't worry.\\" I quickly took out a book from my bag. Min-guk poked me in the side, and he also took out a script. It was for an audition we were going to see in a few days. Min-guk flipped through the pages and started reading the script without the help of mom or me. I looked at Min-guk with surprise. \\"Min-guk, you don't need your brother anymore?\\" \\"Yeah. Ming-gu can read it all by himself.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yeah! Brother, want to read?\\" \\"Sure.\\" Min-guk smiled slyly and continued reading the script. \\"Dad. I want to live with both mom and dad. Jeong-hwan likes both. I can't choose just one.\\" Min-guk read without missing a single character. I looked at Min-guk with surprise. \\"Brother, Ming-gu reads well, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded unconsciously and patted Min-guk on the back. [It's worth teaching him.] Min-guk found it hard to take the first step, but once he did, he did well in everything. It was the same with acting and learning Hangul. Soon, Director Gu Seong-hyeon and the woman who had finished their bossam stood up. \\"Owner, the bill, please.\\" \\"Did you enjoy your meal?\\" \\"Yes, we really enjoyed it. The staff will like it too.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon smiled and neatly packed the bossam. [Gu Seong-hyeon. He's quite picky about taste, so if he says it's good, does that mean we're somewhat recognized? I should gather more service points.] I quickly ran over to Director Gu Seong-hyeon and the woman to say goodbye. \\"Goodbye. Please come again.\\" \\"Yeah. I'll come again. Owner, you've raised your son well.\\" \\"Thank you. Please come again.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon and the woman left the store. My dad smiled brightly and patted my head. \\"Seong-guk, you must be busy studying, but you're helping out at dad's store too. I'll pack some bossam for dinner, so go eat it with mom.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I even danced a little shoulder dance for the first time in a while. \\"I wonder if the judges skipped our house. Why don't people like judges come?\\" [Dad, those people just now were judges from Hyojin Group. Dad, please be more observant!] \\"Dad must have failed.\\" \\"Dad, you'll pass. For sure!\\" \\"You're the only one I have, son.\\" Dad lifted me up. * * * Kim Mi-young visited our house early in the morning. Today was the day Min-guk had the opportunity to secure his livelihood through an audition. I woke up early in the morning, washed Min-guk, and combed his hair instead of the full-bellied mom. \\"Brother, here, here.\\" Min-guk was particular about his hair, brushing it this way and that. \\"Ming-gu, your brother used to get his hair done in Cheongdam-dong. Stay still.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Kim Mi-young was packing her bag when she saw us. \\"Seong-guk really takes good care of Min-guk.\\" Then, mom, holding her belly, walked out. \\"Sister, I heard Song Hye-sun is contacting other agencies... I'm worried. Im Sun-mi is also in a semi-retirement situation, and there are limits to child actors' activities.\\" \\"Seong-guk's mom. We were originally planning to quit this business when Seong-guk retires. It's really amazing that we've come this far.\\" \\"But still... It's a shame. The business was going well.\\" \\"Thanks to Seong-guk and Im Sun-mi, we've established ourselves, but quitting won't leave us starving.\\" [What? Quitting management?] I looked at Kim Mi-young. \\"Absolutely not!\\" Surprised by my voice, Kim Mi-young and mom looked at me. \\"Seong-guk, what's wrong?\\" \\"I'll do it. I'll run the company.\\" I spoke firmly. \\"Seong-guk, you're going to study abroad next year.\\" \\"I'll do it after I come back from studying abroad! The company!\\" I clenched my fist. Kim Mi-young nodded. \\"Alright, this business started because of Seong-guk, so his opinion is the most important. Let's think about reorganizing the team with more substantial actors.\\" \\"No!\\" I shook my head. \\"Seong-guk, besides actors, what?\\" \\"Idols!\\" \\"Idols?\\" \\"Yes. We need to create an idol group.\\" From now on, the Korean entertainment industry will be driven by idols. Already established companies like ST and many others are nurturing idol groups, and South Korea is creating a K-POP craze. I had an interest in entertainment agencies while at Samjeon Group, so I had looked into their systems and training programs. \\"Seong-guk, we don't know much about music...\\" Kim Mi-young showed reluctance. \\"Hmm... Just wait a little. I'll study and definitely create an idol group.\\" \\"Alright, got it. Seong-guk, let's take Min-guk to the audition site for now.\\" [I really want to grow up fast. So fast.] * * * The role Min-guk was auditioning for was the son of the main couple in a 16-episode miniseries. It was a typical story where the main couple divorces, leaving their son behind, and then reunites. I sat in the waiting room, eyeing the children like a hawk. [Among them, are there any faces worth noting for later?] They all had big, round eyes but lacked individuality. Min-guk was next to me, diligently reading and re-reading the script. I patted Min-guk on the back. [Right, if you're not smart, you have to work hard.] Min-guk looked at me once, smiled, and continued reading and re-reading the script. \\"Dad. Dad, I want to hold hands with mom and dad tonight.\\" \\"Min-guk. You need to mix a bit more desperate emotion here. Think about how you're going to sleep alone now, not with mom and dad by your side.\\" \\"Sniff. Ming-gu is sad.\\" \\"Right? Put that emotion into this line.\\" \\"Okay, brother.\\" While I was coaching Min-guk, a boy entered. He seemed to be my age and had a familiar face. It was Lee Jae-hee, my first rival in life and the grandson of Deokpung Paper. Thanks to my help during Min-guk's first audition, he managed to get a small role and seemed to have gotten a few roles since then. Jae-hee's mom, who was always by his side, was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a young woman was present. [Did he join an agency?] I left Min-guk and approached Jae-hee. \\"Jae-hee, do you remember me?\\" I approached him with a bright smile, but Jae-hee looked at me warily. \\"I'm here because of my brother's audition.\\" [Jae-hee, you can never be my rival. I've retired from child acting.] Jae-hee then relaxed and acknowledged me. \\"Oh, hi. Seong-guk, right? Long time no see.\\" \\"You remember.\\" \\"Yeah. Thanks to you, I passed the audition.\\" [Not a blockhead. He understands the situation well.] I quickly greeted the young woman as well. \\"Hello. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Oh my, you're the famous Seong-guk from 'Five Boys and a Baby Basket.'\\" \\"I don't remember well. I was young.\\" \\"I was a huge fan of yours.\\" The woman quickly opened her wallet and handed me a business card. \\"Are you still doing child acting?\\" \\"I'm not doing it now.\\" \\"That's a shame. Here's my card.\\" I memorized the name of the agency at a glance. Shinseong Planning. It was the agency where Shinseong Middle was. \\"Jae-hee is also under Shinseong Planning.\\" [Tsk, tsk, probably a slave contract.] I felt bitter. Then, Kim Mi-young approached from behind. \\"Hello. I'm SKJ's representative, Kim Mi-young, in charge of Seong-guk.\\" \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, in charge of child actors at Shinseong Planning. Nice to meet you.\\" As the two exchanged words, I whispered to Jae-hee. \\"How long did you sign with Shinseong Planning?\\" \\"7 years.\\" \\"That long?\\" \\"But they hardly get me any work. I'm totally neglected.\\" \\"Hmm... Jae-hee, when your contract with Shinseong Planning ends, come find me.\\" Jae-hee's eyes widened. Jae-hee had grown quite a bit and lost his baby fat. Although not extremely handsome, he had a likable face. Jae-hee naively asked. \\"Seong-guk, what will I find if I come to you?\\" \\"Your family's business went under, right?\\" Jae-hee's eyes darkened. \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Your mother?\\" \\"Mom's working. She says her legs hurt all the time. I need to earn money quickly to give my mom a comfortable life.\\" It seemed their situation had worsened since then. At least, it was good that Jae-hee's mother had come to her senses. \\"Jae-hee, do well in both school and child acting. Choose your friends wisely, don't hang out with bad kids, and don't get caught in unnecessary photos. That way, you won't have any problems when you become an entertainer.\\" \\"I'll try.\\" \\"It's not about trying. You have to do it. Got it?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Jae-hee nodded. \\"Part ways with Shinseong Planning amicably. If you want to revive your family's fortunes, come find me after 7 years.\\" \\"Seong-guk, how can I find you?\\" \\"SKJ Entertainment will still be here, so make sure to come find me.\\" \\"Yeah. I'll definitely come find you.\\" Then, Lee Joo-mi called Jae-hee. \\"Jae-hee, it's your turn next. Did you memorize all your lines?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Jae-hee stood up and grabbed me. \\"Seong-guk, thank you.\\" \\"See you in 7 years.\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Jae-hee entered the audition room with a much brighter face. \\"Brother!\\" Min-guk was looking for me from behind. \\"Brother! Brother! Min-guk needs to poop!\\" [Sigh.] Min-guk had a bad habit of needing to poop right before entering the audition room. \\"Got it. Hold it in.\\" \\"I can't, brother!\\" I quickly grabbed Min-guk's hand and ran to the bathroom. \\"Brother, pants. Quick! I'm in a hurry!\\" I quickly pulled down Min-guk's pants. As soon as Min-guk sat on the toilet, he found peace of mind. \\"Phew... So refreshing.\\" Swoosh. I held my nose and flushed the toilet.

[하아, 아빠. 세상 오래 안 살아봐서 모르나 본데, 돈이 곧 행복이라고!] 나는 속으로 버럭 화를 내다 문득 멈칫했다. 저번 생에서 주간지 인터뷰 중에 나에게 삼전 그룹의 후계자로 살아서 행복하냐고 물었던 적이 있었다. 나는 그때 행복하다고 답했다. 하지만 행복하지 않았다. 부모님은 사이가 나빴고, 동생들은 경쟁자들이었다. 누군가 뒤처지기를 바랄 뿐이었다. 아내와의 관계는 서먹했고, 자식들은 사랑했지만 일찍부터 유학을 보내 곁에 두고 보지도 못했다. 뭐만 하면 후계자의 자리를 위협하던 사람들. 주변에 사람은 많았지만, 의지할 사람은 아무도 없었다. 나는 저번 생에서 정말 행복했을까? 아빠가 나를 꼭 안았다. “성국아, 어서 커서 아빠랑 맥주 한잔 해야지.” [아빠, 난 와인. 맥주는 배 나온다고.] 아빠는 나를 안아 들고 내 방으로 들어갔다. “아빠, 나 화장실!” “아차, 깜빡했네. 미안. 아빠가 미안한 김에 화장실 앞까지 비행기 태워줄게.” [아빠, 나 어린애 아니라고.] “자, 갑니다. 아빠 비행기!” 하지만 또 아빠 비위도 맞춰줘야지. 까르르르. [이럴 땐 웃어줘야지.] 내가 웃자 아빠의 웃음소리가 들렸다. [내가 진짜 아빠 업어 키운다, 키워.] * * * “구수영 회장님께서 성국 군을 후원하실 모양입니다. 돌아가신 첫째 아드님의 이름으로 만든 준호 재단의 첫 장학생으로요.” 양 비서는 말을 마치고 전재형 회장의 얼굴을 살폈다. 전재형 회장의 미간이 구겨졌다. 좀처럼 펴질 줄 몰랐다. “이유가 궁금한데…. 왜 삼전이 아니고 효진인 거지?” “잘은 모르지만, 효진 그룹에서 성국 군에게 조건 없는 지원을 약속했다고 합니다.” “우리도 마찬가지 아니었던가.” “하지만 삼전 장학생의 경우 삼전 그룹에 입사하거나, 사회에 나가서 삼전에 관한 일을 할 때 삼전으로부터 자유롭지 못하다는 인식이 있습니다. 성국 군과 가족들은 그 부분이 걸린 모양입니다.” 전재형 회장은 가운뎃손가락으로 구겨진 미간을 폈다. 처음 맛보는 실패였다. 공들인 탑이 무너진 순간이기도 했다. “양 비서, 이제 성국이에게서 손을 떼도록 하지. 우리도 할 만큼 했고, 효진 그룹에서 후원한다니 성국이가 엇나가지만 않는다면 좋은 인재가 될 거야.” “네. 알겠습니다.” “괜찮다면 후원 계획과 출국 일정만 알려주게.” “알아내는 대로 바로 보고하겠습니다.” 전재형 회장은 머리를 싸잡았다. 와인이 딱 한 잔 필요한 타이밍이었지만, 회사라 참았다. ‘성국이에게 왜 이렇게 미련이 남을까?’ 전재형 회장 자신도 이해하지 못하는 미련이었다. 뭘 해도 부족한 태국이 대신 자신의 후계자 재목이라 여겨서일까…. 전재형 회장은 고개를 저었다. 훌륭한 인재야 널렸다. 삼전의 후원이면 줄을 설 인재들도 많았다. 성국이에게 끌리는 건 정말 삼청동 이 선생의 말처럼 부자간의 인연, 그런 느낌이었다. ‘내 아들이었으면… 내 새끼였으면… 내 후계자였으면….’ 전재형 회장은 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 그러곤 발아래 펼쳐진 서울을 내려다봤다. 분명 다 가졌는데, 단 하나 가지지 못한 것. 그건 후계자였다. * * * 황철수 비서가 보쌈집 테이블 위에 나를 위한 플랜이 가득 담긴 계획표와 학교 카탈로그를 펼쳐 놨다. 설명은 황철수 비서 옆에 앉은 효진가 첫째 딸 구예정이 시작했다. “성국아, 네 영어 실력이 충분히 좋고 토플도 거의 만점이지만 우선 어학연수 겸 사회성을 기르기 위해서 단기 어학 코스를 진행하려고 해.” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. “그다음에 여기는 우리 동생 준호도 다닌 명문 사립이거든. 우리나라로 치면 중고등학교가 같이 있는 곳인데, 기숙사가 제공되는 학교야. 여기에 입학 허가를 받으려고.” 익숙한 곳이었다. 나는 아니지만, 저번 생에서 내 자식들이 다닌 명문 보딩스쿨이었다. 저번 생에서 내가 직접 자식들을 위해 선택한 보딩스쿨인 만큼 모든 게 완벽했다. 나는 미소를 지었다. “어서 공부하고 싶어요.” “성국아, 넌 그대로만 이쁘게 크자. 그 얼굴이면 나 같으면 공부 안 하고 연예인 했을 거야.” 효진가 둘째이자 막내 구예리가 투덜거렸다. “누나도 같이 가요?” “나도 그 근처 고등학교 좀 다니다 난 편하게 아무 대학이나 갈 거야.” “구예리. 제발 정신 차리고 공부 좀 하자.” “언니, 난 돈 많으니까 편하게 살 거야. 언니나 공부 열심히 해서 회사 물려받아.” “나도 자신이 없어 그래.” 구예정도 투덜거렸다. 사실 효진 그룹의 가장 불행한 지점은 저번 생의 나만큼 똑똑한 이 집 장남 구준호가 일찍 세상을 떠난 일이었다. “성국아, 이제 몇 달 후면 미국 갈 건데, 뭐 하며 지낼 거야?” 구예리가 눈을 반짝이며 물었다. 나는 턱을 매만졌다. “주식 좀 사려고요.” * * * 1998년 7월 코스피는 300선마저 붕괴되고 200선으로 추락한다. 더 이상 떨어질 곳이 없을 것 같자, 땅마저 파고 들어가는 실정이었다. 나는 주식거래소에 앉아서 코스피 지수가 추락하는 화살표를 보며 흐뭇한 표정을 지었다. 같이 온 아빠는 안절부절못했다. “성국아, 요즘 누가 주식을 해. 오늘도 어제보다 더 떨어졌고, 내일은 더 떨어질 거라고 그래. 우리 가지고 있는 삼전 주식도 파는 게 낫지 않을까?” “…….” 나는 입을 꼭 다물고 고개를 저었다. 위기는 곧 기회이다! 이건 개미들이 꼭 기억해야 할 말이었다. 위기에 베팅할 배포가 없으면 부자 될 기회는 잡을 수가 없다. 나는 삼전에 베팅하기로 했다. 남은 돈 2억을 모두! “성국아….” 아빠가 내 등을 딱 잡았다. “아빠, 나만 믿어!” 다음 날 코스피는 좀 더 더 떨어졌다. 삼전 전자 역시 안 떨어질 수가 없었다. 가게에서 나란히 앉아 뉴스를 보던 아빠의 얼굴은 거의 울상이었다. “성국아, 이번 투자는 정말 잘못한 거 같아.” “아빠!” “응?” “투자는 길게 보는 거야. 나 미국 다녀와서 다 팔 거야.” “하아….” 아빠는 나보다 더 절망적인 얼굴이었다. 이때, 가게의 전화가 요란하게 울렸다. 아빠는 축 처진 어깨로 일어났다. “그래, 성국아. 괜찮아. 이젠 아빠가 돈 많이 벌게.” 그러곤 곧 전화를 받았다. “여보세요. 네… 맞습니다. 정말요? 진짜요? 진짜 제가 된 거죠!” 아빠의 얼굴에 곧 화색이 돌았다. “네, 알겠습니다. 본선 준비하겠습니다!” [진짜 아빠 아직 어리다니까. 쯧쯧.] 아빠는 전화를 끊고 달려오더니 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 아빠가 이번 효진 푸드 맛집 찾기 본선에 진출했대!” “아빠, 난 그럴 줄 알았어.” “이 녀석 좀 봐라. 되고 나니 그럴 줄 알았대.” [난 진짜 알았다고. 구성현 부장한테 내가 얼마나 고개를 숙였는데. 어? 나 전성국이 허리가 나가는 줄 알았다고!] 아빠는 나를 놓고는 정신없이 가게를 돌아다녔다. “근데 뭘 하면 되지? 이제부터… 수유 본점 사장님한테 전화를 걸어야겠지….” 정신없는 아빠를 붙잡았다. “아빠, 엄마한테 먼저 연락.” “아, 맞다. 그리고 수유 사장님한테 전화해야겠다.” [그렇지. 정말 아빠는 나 없으면 안 돼. 이런 아빠 두고 어떻게 유학 가지?] 나는 눈앞이 깜깜했다. * * * 효진 푸드의 맛집 간편식을 만드는 경연 본선 진출은 전국에서 총 서른 개의 팀이 결정됐다. 이 팀들 중에서 한식, 중식, 일식, 양식별로 두 팀씩, 총 여덟 팀이 최종 간편식 팀으로 결정된다. 구성현 부장이 앞에 선 본선 진출자들을 보며 설명을 했다. “최종 선발된 여덟 팀은 저희 효진 푸드 팀과 함께 간편식 개발에 바로 착수할 예정입니다. 최종 선발되지 않더라고 저희 효진 푸드에서는 지속적으로 새로운 간편식을 같이 개발할 기회가 주어지니, 너무 낙심하지 마세요.” 엄마 그리고 나, 민국이와 김미영 팀장까지 모두 플래카드 맞춰서 아빠를 응원하러 나온 길이었다. - 아빠, 힘내세요! 이 플래카드 때문에 모두의 시선이 우리 집 식구들에게 집중됐다. [하아, 숨고 싶다.] 거기다 지나가는 사람마다 “네가 그 TV. 맞지?” “네, 맞아요. 전성국입니다.”를 벌써 서른 번쯤 한 것 같았다. “성국아, 아빠가 너 덕분에 힘 엄청 낼 거 같아.” 김미영이 쀼루퉁한 얼굴의 나를 보며 위로했다. 이때 내 머릿속에는 새로운 아이디어가 떠올랐다. “대표님.” “응, 왜?” “이런 프로그램 만들면 어때요?” “무슨 프로그램?” “이런 음식 경연대회요. 사람들이 음식에 위로를 가장 많이 받잖아요. 유명 맛집이나, 유명 쉐프들뿐 아니라 우리가 몰랐던 숨겨진 실력자들을 찾는 일종의 오디션이요.” 김미영이 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. [김 매니저, 뭐가 그렇게 놀라워. 나 전성국이야. 인생 2회 차라고.] “언니, 왜 그래요?” “아니, 방금 성국이가 아주 좋은 아이디어를 말해서….” “뭔데요?” “요리사 오디션을 해보면 어떨까?” “저희가요?” “매니지먼트도 매니지먼트지만, 외주 제작을 해보면 어떨까 고민 중이었거든. 삼전 기획에 있을 때 만났던 외주 제작 감독이나 작가들도 내가 좀 아니까….” 엄마도 화색이 돌았다. “언니, 안 그래도 저희 매니지먼트 방향성 고민 중이었잖아요. 한번 고민해봐도 좋을 것 같아요.” “그렇지… 외주 제작도 하면서 매니지먼트도 하면 우리 배우들도 외주 제작 프로그램에 자연스레 출연시킬 수도 있고….” [내 말이 그 말이야.] 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. “정말 재미있을 것 같은데….” 김미영의 눈이 오랜만에 반짝였다.","output":"Episode 69 Minguk was chosen as the main character's son in a 16-episode miniseries. The role had a significant amount of screen time per episode, so the income was good. It was a relief that he seemed to be making a living. Moreover, his mother's belly was growing day by day, and his father's bossam restaurant was slowly regaining its vitality. However, there was still no contact from Hyojin Food. After work, worry filled his father's voice as he drank beer. \\"Soyoung, maybe it was a mistake to apply. The owner of Suyu keeps calling every day... Why isn’t the result coming out?\\" \\"It's a big company. When I worked with models and big companies, I noticed it takes longer than expected because there are many stages of approval.\\" \\"That's true...\\" \\"Honey, don't be discouraged even if you don't make it. You said many long-established restaurants applied too.\\" \\"I at least wanted to pass the preliminary round. As a father, I wanted to show Seonguk and Minguk that I could do it.\\" While studying at my desk, I suddenly heard my father's sigh and felt a surge of emotion. It seemed he wanted to show us his growth. I quietly opened the door. \\"Seonguk, going to the bathroom?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Seonguk, were mom and dad's voices loud while you were studying?\\" My father quickly ran to me and hugged me tightly. I could feel my father's thin back. Is this what it feels like as I grow taller and my father seems to shrink? \\"Dad, to Seonguk, you're always the best.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded sincerely. The poorest of the poor. My father, who was born into this world with nothing to rely on, did his best to take care of me and our family. He always wrapped us in love and worried about how his children would live. I patted my father's thin back. \\"Dad... Seonguk will grow up quickly and earn a lot of money.\\" \\"Seonguk. Dad doesn't wish for you to make a lot of money. I just want you to be happy.\\" What? What did he just say? Happiness.... [Ha, Dad. You must not know because you haven't lived long in this world, but money is happiness!] I was about to burst out in anger internally when I suddenly paused. In my previous life, during an interview with a weekly magazine, I was asked if I was happy living as the heir to the Samjeon Group. I answered that I was happy. But I wasn't happy. My parents had a bad relationship, and my siblings were competitors. Everyone just hoped someone else would fall behind. My relationship with my wife was awkward, and although I loved my children, I sent them abroad for education early and couldn't keep them by my side. People always threatened my position as the heir. There were many people around me, but no one I could rely on. Was I really happy in my previous life? My father hugged me tightly. \\"Seonguk, let's have a beer together when you grow up.\\" [Dad, I prefer wine. Beer makes you gain weight.] My father carried me into my room. \\"Dad, I need to go to the bathroom!\\" \\"Oh, I forgot. Sorry. Let me give you an airplane ride to the bathroom as an apology.\\" [Dad, I'm not a kid.] \\"Here we go. Dad's airplane!\\" But I had to play along with my father's mood. Giggling. [I should smile at times like this.] Hearing me laugh, my father also laughed. [I'm really raising my dad, raising him.] * * * \\"Chairman Koo Sooyoung has decided to sponsor Seonguk. He will be the first scholarship recipient of the Junho Foundation, named after his late eldest son.\\" Secretary Yang finished speaking and gauged Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's reaction. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's brow furrowed. It didn't seem to relax easily. \\"I'm curious about the reason... Why not Samjeon but Hyojin?\\" \\"I'm not sure, but it seems Hyojin Group has promised unconditional support to Seonguk.\\" \\"Wasn't it the same for us?\\" \\"However, there's a perception that Samjeon scholarship recipients are not free from Samjeon Group if they join the company or work in society related to Samjeon. It seems that was a concern for Seonguk and his family.\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung smoothed his furrowed brow with his middle finger. It was his first taste of failure. It was also the moment a tower he had invested in crumbled. \\"Secretary Yang, let's step back from Seonguk. We've done enough, and since Hyojin Group is sponsoring him, as long as Seonguk doesn't go astray, he'll become a great talent.\\" \\"Yes, I understand.\\" \\"If possible, just inform me about the sponsorship plan and departure schedule.\\" \\"I'll report as soon as I find out.\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung held his head. He needed a glass of wine, but he refrained since he was at the office. 'Why can't I let go of Seonguk?' Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung couldn't understand his own lingering feelings. Was it because he saw Seonguk as a potential heir, a replacement for his own lacking descendants? Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung shook his head. There were plenty of excellent talents. There were many talents who would line up for Samjeon's sponsorship. The attraction to Seonguk was really like what Teacher Lee from Samcheong-dong said, a connection between father and son. 'If he were my son... my child... my heir...' Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung stood up abruptly. Then he looked down at Seoul spread out beneath his feet. He had everything, but there was one thing he couldn't have. That was an heir. * * * Secretary Hwang Cheol-soo spread out a plan full of plans for me and a school catalog on the bossam restaurant table. The explanation was started by Koo Ye-jeong, the eldest daughter of Hyojin family, sitting next to Secretary Hwang. \\"Seonguk, your English skills are sufficient, and your TOEFL score is almost perfect, but first, we plan to conduct a short-term language course to improve your social skills.\\" I nodded. \\"Then, this is a prestigious private school that our younger brother Junho also attended. It's like a combined middle and high school in our country, and it offers boarding. We're trying to get admission here.\\" It was a familiar place. Not for me, but in my previous life, it was the prestigious boarding school my children attended. As it was a boarding school I personally chose for my children in my previous life, everything was perfect. I smiled. \\"I want to start studying soon.\\" \\"Seonguk, just grow up beautifully as you are. If I had that face, I would have become a celebrity instead of studying.\\" Koo Ye-ri, the youngest and second daughter of the Hyojin family, grumbled. \\"Are you going too, sister?\\" \\"I'll attend a nearby high school for a while, then I'll go to any college comfortably.\\" \\"Ye-ri. Please, let's focus and study.\\" \\"Sister, I have a lot of money, so I'll live comfortably. You study hard and take over the company.\\" \\"I'm not confident either.\\" Koo Ye-jeong also grumbled. In fact, the most unfortunate aspect of the Hyojin Group was the early death of the smartest son of the family, Koo Junho, who was as smart as me in my previous life. \\"Seonguk, you're going to the US in a few months, what are you going to do?\\" Koo Ye-ri asked with sparkling eyes. I stroked my chin. \\"I'm thinking of buying some stocks.\\" * * * In July 1998, the KOSPI broke through the 300-point barrier and plummeted to the 200-point range. It seemed there was no further to fall, as if even the ground was giving way. I sat at the stock exchange, watching the KOSPI index plummet with a satisfied expression. My father, who came with me, was restless. \\"Seonguk, who invests in stocks these days? It fell more today than yesterday, and it will fall even more tomorrow. Shouldn't we sell the Samjeon stocks we have?\\" \\"......\\" I firmly shut my mouth and shook my head. A crisis is an opportunity! This was something ants must remember. If you don't have the courage to bet on a crisis, you can't seize the opportunity to become rich. I decided to bet on Samjeon. All of my remaining 200 million won! \\"Seonguk....\\" My father grabbed my back. \\"Trust me, Dad!\\" The next day, the KOSPI fell even further. Samjeon Electronics couldn't help but fall as well. Sitting side by side in the restaurant, watching the news, my father's face was almost in tears. \\"Seonguk, this investment seems really wrong.\\" \\"Dad!\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Investment is about looking at the long term. I'll sell everything when I come back from the US.\\" \\"Ha...\\" My father looked even more despairing than me. Then, the restaurant's phone rang loudly. My father stood up with slumped shoulders. \\"Alright, Seonguk. It's okay. Dad will earn a lot of money now.\\" Then he answered the phone. \\"Hello. Yes... Yes, that's right. Really? Really, I made it?\\" Joy returned to my father's face. \\"Yes, I understand. I'll prepare for the finals!\\" [I told you, Dad is still young. Tsk tsk.] My father hung up the phone and ran to me, lifting me up. \\"Seonguk, Dad made it to the finals of the Hyojin Food Delicious Restaurant Search!\\" \\"Dad, I knew it would happen.\\" \\"Look at this guy. Now that it's happened, he says he knew it would.\\" [I really knew it. Do you know how much I bowed to Manager Koo Seong-hyun? Huh? I thought my back was going to break!] My father put me down and started running around the restaurant in a frenzy. \\"But what should I do now? From now on... I should call the Suyu main branch owner first...\\" I grabbed my frantic father. \\"Dad, call Mom first.\\" \\"Ah, right. And then I should call the Suyu owner.\\" [That's right. Dad really can't do without me. How can I go abroad leaving such a dad behind?] I felt darkness before my eyes. * * * A total of thirty teams were selected for the finals of the Hyojin Food Delicious Ready-Meal Competition. Among these teams, two teams each from Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Western cuisine, a total of eight teams, will be selected as the final ready-meal teams. Manager Koo Seong-hyun stood in front of the finalists and explained. \\"The eight teams selected in the final will immediately start developing ready-meals with our Hyojin Food team. Even if you are not selected in the final, Hyojin Food will continue to provide opportunities to develop new ready-meals together, so don't be too discouraged.\\" Mom, Minguk, Kim Mi-young, the manager, and I all came out with banners to support Dad. - Dad, cheer up! Because of this banner, everyone's attention was focused on our family. [Ha, I want to hide.] Moreover, passersby kept saying, \\"You're the one from TV, right?\\" \\"Yes, that's right. I'm Seonguk.\\" I must have said it about thirty times already. \\"Seonguk, Dad feels like he can gain a lot of strength thanks to you.\\" <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> comforted me, who had a sullen face. Then, a new idea popped into my head. \\"Manager.\\" \\"Yes, why?\\" \\"How about making a program like this?\\" \\"What kind of program?\\" \\"A cooking competition. People receive the most comfort from food, right? It could be a kind of audition to find hidden talents, not just famous restaurants or chefs.\\" Kim Mi-young looked at me with surprised eyes. [Manager Kim, what's so surprising? I'm Seonguk. I'm on my second life.] \\"Sister, what's wrong?\\" \\"No, Seonguk just mentioned a really good idea...\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"How about a chef audition?\\" \\"Us?\\" \\"I was considering external production as well as management. I know some directors and writers from when I was at Samjeon Planning...\\" Mom also looked pleased. \\"Sister, we were considering the direction of our management anyway. It might be good to think about it.\\" \\"That's right...

[오늘은 내가 양보해주지.] 나는 팔짱을 끼고 구성현 부장의 발표를 기다렸다. “자, 이제 마지막은 한식 부문입니다. 까다로운 한식을 간편식으로 만드시기 위해 모두 애 많이 쓰셨습니다. 그럼, 효진 푸드와 함께할 첫 번째 팀은…. 오늘 접시 깨지셨는데, 합격하셨습니다. 바로 <마산 아구찜> 팀입니다.” “와아!” 손에 붕대를 둘둘 만 아주머니가 일어나서 환호를 했다. 아빠는 부러운 눈길로 아주머니를 쳐다봤다. [자, 다음 팀 어서!] 구성현 부장이 심사 차트를 보더니 빙긋 미소를 지었다. “정말 오늘 아이디어와 맛 모두 좋은 점수를 받은 팀입니다. 보쌈 도시락과 1인용 족발 술안주를 만드신 <원아저씨 보쌈> 팀입니다! 축하드립니다!” 아빠는 그 순간 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 그러곤 나와 민국이를 안아 들고 뽀뽀를 해댔다. “성국아, 민국아. 아빠가 해냈어!” [아빠, 뽀뽀는 사양할게.] “성국아, 아빠가 사랑한다.” 아빠는 연신 뽀뽀를 해댔다. [그래, 오늘만 허락해줄게. 내일부터는 국물도 없어, 아빠.] 나는 볼을 슬그머니 아빠 쪽으로 돌렸다. * * * 아빠와 수유 사장님은 가게에서 심각하게 계약서를 검토 중이었다. 김미영이 옆에서 돕고 있었다. “계약서상으로는 크게 문제가 없네요. 지원할 때 조건과 동일하네요. 1년 내에 간편식을 각 상호를 따서 출시하고 개런티로 순매출의 10프로네요.” “사인해도 되겠죠, 김 대표님?” “제가 보기에는 큰 문제는 없어 보입니다. 두 분 축하드려요!” 김미영의 말에 아빠와 수유점 사장님은 그제야 미소를 지었다. “와, 이게 꿈이야, 생시야! 우리 상호 이름으로 된 상품이 전국 마트랑 편의점에 짝 깔리는 거잖아.” 수유점 사장님은 거의 울 것 같은 얼굴이었다. “참, 두 분도 계약서를 작성하시는 게 좋을 것 같아요.” 김미영이 감격한 두 사람에게 찬물을 끼얹었다. “저희끼리도요?” “네. 동업이라는 게 원래 좀 어렵잖아요. 두 분 모두 고생하셨고, 서로 잘되는 것을 바라는 것도 잘 알지만, 계약서로 깔끔하게 서로 수익 배분하는 것도 정리해두는 게 좋을 것 같아서요. 나중을 위해서라도요.” 김미영의 말은 정확했다. 처음엔 의리로, 우정으로 시작한 사업이, 되든 안 되든 싸우고 헤어지는 게 동업의 수순이었다. “전 수유점 사장님이 더 수익 많이 가져가셔야 한다고 생각해요.” [아빠, 지금 무슨 소리야?] 옆 테이블에서 사이다를 마시며 대화를 듣던 나는 발끈했다. “무슨 소리야. 이 기회며 뭐며 다 자네 덕분이잖아. 도시락이나 1인용 술안주 아이디어도 다 자네가 낸 거고. 이번 경연에서 제일 중요한 건 간편식으로 만들어낸 아이디어였어.” [수유 사장님, 간만에 마음에 통하네.] 하지만 아빠는 고개를 절레절레 저었다. “사장님이 보쌈과 족발 기술 전수 안 해주셨으면 이 자리도 없었죠.” “두 분, 그럼 공평하게 5 대 5로 하시죠. 지분도 5 대 5. 그리고 나중에 연계된 어떤 사업을 하든 5 대 5로 시작하는 것으로요. 그리고 한쪽의 일방적인 계약 파기도 안 되며, 타인에게 양도도 안 됩니다.” “당연하지. 난 죽을 때까지 보쌈집 할 거야.” 수유점 사장님이 허허 웃었다. “저두요. 사장님, 그럼 저희 뭘 하든 공평하게 5 대 5. 그렇게 해요.” “고마워.” “무슨 말씀이세요. 제가 항상 더 고맙죠.” “그냥저냥 막걸리집 하는 나한테 보쌈 전문점 해보라고 한 것도 자네고, 이 대회 나가자고 한 것도 자네잖아. 자네 덕분에 나까지 덩달아 성장하는 것 같아서 고마워.” [사장님, 앞으로도 그 고마움 절대 잊지 마세요.] 수유점 사장님은 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국이 이 녀석, 뭐라 쫑알거리냐. 성국아, 넌 진짜 복덩이다. 너 태어나고 너희 집도 다 잘 풀리고, 아저씨도 덩달아 잘 풀리고.” [당연하지. 전직 재벌이 되는 건 로또 당첨되기보다도 어려운 복을 타고난 사람이라고!]","output":"Episode 70 \\"The time given to you from now is 2 hours. During this time, please recreate a dish suitable for convenience food. Now, let's begin!\\" With the words of Director Gu Seong-hyeon, the competition began. Since the dish was to be produced using a large corporation's factory system, the main goal was to create a dish that could be easily released within 2 hours. The father and the owner of <Uncle Won's Bossam> nursing home had focused on launching a dish suitable for convenience food over the past month. The father's idea was to make bossam and jokbal available in convenience stores and supermarkets as single-serving snacks and lunch boxes, as they are dishes that require a long time to prepare. The family watched eagerly from the cheering section set up around the competition area as the father and the nursing home owner cooked. Sweat naturally formed on their hands. Min-guk's brow also furrowed deeply. The father and the nursing home owner, having worked together for a long time, started cooking seamlessly, taking turns being the main chef. The mother clasped her hands and watched the father cook. I couldn't take my eyes off the father cooking either. Before I knew it, I was holding my mother's hand tightly. The mother patted my hand. \\"Seong-guk, your father is really cool....\\" \\"Yes!\\" I answered vehemently. The father was always a solid head of the household and a person who silently did his work. Today, he was a truly cool person doing what he loved. Director Gu Seong-hyeon grabbed the microphone again. \\"There are 30 minutes left. Please set up according to the convenience food lunch box we have prepared.\\" Clang! At that moment, the sound of a plate dropping to the floor was heard. It was the agujjim team cooking right next to the father. \\"What should we do now.\\" The lady, in a hurry, touched the plate with her hand and ended up bleeding profusely. \\"Please wait a moment! We will stop for 10 minutes. All other teams, please stop as well!\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon quickly went to the agujjim team with the paramedics. A paramedic quickly applied pressure to the bleeding hand and administered first aid. The father, wearing several thick gloves, quickly cleaned up the broken plate. The lady kept apologizing to the father. \\"I'm so sorry.\\" \\"It's okay, you're not hurt. That's what matters.\\" The staff came and quickly cleaned up the broken plate. Almost 10 minutes had passed. The flow was important in cooking. The flow of the father and the nursing home owner, who were just slicing the freshly cooked bossam and jokbal, was also interrupted. And there were 30 minutes left! The clock started ticking again. Director Gu Seong-hyeon started the countdown. \\"Now, there are 5 minutes left. Everyone, please start wrapping up.\\" All thirty teams were frantically finishing up. The father and the nursing home owner were seen checking until the last moment to make sure nothing was missed. The father neatly placed the bossam in the convenience food lunch box, filled the empty space with shrimp sauce, and added white rice, pickled radish, and kimchi on the side. \\"Now, there are 30 seconds left. Please stop your hands and step back when the bell rings. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!\\" At the shout of Director Gu Seong-hyeon, the bell rang. The father and the nursing home owner looked at each other, smiled faintly, and took a step back. Sweat poured down the father's face like rain. \\"Everyone, you've worked hard. Now, five specially invited expert judges will start the evaluation.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon put down the microphone and picked up the evaluation chart. Then, he and the other five expert judges began to visit each team. The father's team was in the latter half. The experts discussed the composition and taste of the convenience food with eagle eyes. It was hard to guess their thoughts because they all had poker faces. The father and the nursing home owner wiped their sweat and waited anxiously for their turn. Finally, it was the father's turn. Director Gu Seong-hyeon smiled and greeted them, then examined the bossam lunch box. \\"You've made a lunch box with bossam.\\" \\"Yes, people usually think of bossam as a drinking snack, but actually, boiled meat and kimchi can be a great meal. It's filling for just one meal and allows you to get a balanced intake of nutrients, so we composed it this way.\\" \\"You've made the jokbal as a drinking snack?\\" \\"Jokbal has a texture that comes alive when it cools down. Many people like that chewy texture. Considering the characteristics of convenience stores and supermarkets that require refrigerated distribution, we made jokbal as a drinking snack. Plus, with the increasing number of single-person households, we set it up for one person.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon nodded. The experts tasted the bossam lunch box and jokbal snack, meticulously writing something on the evaluation chart. \\"We've seen it well.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon passed by the father and the nursing home owner with an inscrutable face. The father finally took a breath and looked at his family. I gave my father a thumbs up. \\"Dad, you're the best!\\" As my voice echoed through the competition hall, everyone burst into laughter. The father smiled at me more brightly than ever. I was proud to be born as my father's son in this life. * * * The process is more important than the result. It's enough that we worked hard. That's all nonsense! I anxiously awaited the father's evaluation results. \\"Honey, you really worked hard today.\\" \\"I'm so nervous about the result.\\" \\"Seong-guk's father, you were really amazing today. My hands were sweating.\\" \\"The result should be good too.\\" [Of course. If the result is bad, everything is bad!] I clenched my fist. \\"Seong-guk, your father was cool today, right?\\" \\"Yeah. A little.\\" \\"Weren't you saying he was the best earlier?\\" [That was then, but now we're waiting for the result. Dad, let's not lose tension.] I patted my father's back to keep him in check. The nursing home owner laughed at me. \\"Seong-guk is more nervous. Thanks to you, or rather, thanks to Seong-guk, we participated in this competition and had a really good experience.\\" [Owner, it's not over until it's over! Why are you talking as if it's all done!] I glanced at the owner with eagle eyes and anxiously awaited the result. Finally, Director Gu Seong-hyeon came out with the paper containing the evaluation results. The bustling hall suddenly quieted down. Everyone's gaze was focused on Director Gu Seong-hyeon. \\"You've waited a long time. But before that, I want to say thank you to everyone for their hard work today.\\" [Skip the small talk and announce the results already!] \\"Now, let's announce the results without further delay. As planned, we've selected two teams each from Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Western cuisine, making a total of eight teams. First, let's announce the Western cuisine category. <Familiar Pasta> who made Italian pasta convenience food and <King Steak> who made steak lunch boxes!\\" \\"Wow!\\" Cheers and applause erupted simultaneously. The losers in the same Western cuisine category managed to clap for them. In the end, only the winners exist in the world. Japanese and Chinese cuisines were announced in turn. Now, it was finally time for Korean cuisine. As I reached out to hold my father's hand, my mother was already holding it tightly. [Today, I'll let it go.] I crossed my arms and waited for Director Gu Seong-hyeon's announcement. \\"Now, the last category is Korean cuisine. It was challenging to make Korean cuisine into convenience food, and everyone worked hard. The first team to join Hyojin Food is... despite breaking a plate today, you've passed. It's the <Masan Agujjim> team.\\" \\"Wow!\\" The lady with bandages on her hand stood up and cheered. The father looked at the lady enviously. [Now, the next team, hurry up!] Director Gu Seong-hyeon looked at the evaluation chart and smiled faintly. \\"Today, a team that received good scores for both idea and taste. The team that made bossam lunch boxes and single-serving jokbal snacks, <Uncle Won's Bossam> team! Congratulations!\\" At that moment, the father stood up abruptly. Then he hugged me and Min-guk and showered us with kisses. \\"Seong-guk, Min-guk. Dad did it!\\" [Dad, I'll pass on the kisses.] \\"Seong-guk, Dad loves you.\\" The father kept giving kisses. [Alright, I'll let it slide for today. No more from tomorrow, Dad.] I slightly turned my cheek towards my father. * * * The father and the nursing home owner were seriously reviewing the contract at the store. Kim Mi-young was helping them. \\"There doesn't seem to be a big problem with the contract. It's the same as the conditions provided during the application. You'll launch convenience food under each brand name within a year and get a guarantee of 10% of the net sales.\\" \\"Should we sign it, CEO Kim?\\" \\"From what I see, there doesn't seem to be a big problem. Congratulations to both of you!\\" At Kim Mi-young's words, the father and the nursing home owner finally smiled. \\"Wow, is this a dream or reality! Our brand name products will be lined up in supermarkets and convenience stores nationwide.\\" The nursing home owner's face looked almost tearful. \\"By the way, you two should also draft a contract.\\" \\"Between us too?\\" \\"Yes. Business partnerships are originally a bit difficult. I know both of you have worked hard and wish each other well, but it's better to cleanly arrange the profit distribution through a contract for the future. Just in case.\\" Kim Mi-young's words were accurate. Whether a business started with loyalty or friendship, ending up fighting and breaking up was the course of partnership, whether it succeeded or not. \\"I think the nursing home owner should take more profit.\\" [Dad, what are you talking about?] Listening to the conversation while drinking soda at the next table, I was indignant. \\"What are you talking about? This opportunity and everything is thanks to you. The idea for the lunch box and single-serving drinking snack was all yours. The most important thing in this competition was the idea of making it into convenience food.\\" [Owner, we finally see eye to eye.] But the father shook his head. \\"If the owner hadn't taught me the bossam and jokbal techniques, we wouldn't be here.\\" \\"You two, then let's make it fair and go 50-50. Share and profit distribution 50-50. And if you start any related business in the future, start it 50-50. Also, unilateral contract termination by one party is not allowed, nor is transfer to another person.\\" \\"Of course. I'm going to run a bossam restaurant until I die.\\" The nursing home owner laughed heartily. \\"Me too. Owner, let's make everything fair and go 50-50.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" \\"What are you talking about? I'm always more grateful.\\" \\"It was you who suggested I run a bossam specialty restaurant and participate in this competition. Thanks to you, I feel like I'm growing too.\\" [Owner, never forget that gratitude.] The nursing home owner patted my head. \\"Seong-guk, what are you grumbling about? Seong-guk, you're really a blessing. Since you were born, your house has been doing well, and I've been doing well too.\\" [Of course. Being born as a former chaebol is luckier than winning the lottery!]"},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello!

A posição do div é atualizada ajustando-se as propriedades \`left\` e \`top\` com base na posição atual e na velocidade definida. Lembre-se, este é um exemplo muito simples e um jogo real teria muito mais considerações a serem feitas, incluindo mas não limitado a detecção de colisões, animações mais complexas, e uma arquitetura de código mais robusta.

Это может включать выборку из базы данных для проверки существующих значений перед вставкой. 2. **Обновление записей вместо вставки:** Если ваше намерение состоит в том, чтобы обновить существующие данные, а не вставлять новые, используйте оператор \`UPDATE\` вместо \`INSERT\`. 3. **Ошибку можно обработать в приложении:** Может быть ситуация, когда ожидается попытка вставки дублирующихся данных. В этом случае можно обработать исключение и, например, оповестить пользователя о том, что данные уже существуют. 4. **Использование \`INSERT OR REPLACE\` или \`INSERT OR IGNORE\`:** SQLite поддерживает эти две директивы, которые могут помочь управлять ситуациями с уникальным нарушением. \`INSERT OR REPLACE\` заменит существующие данные новыми, тогда как \`INSERT OR IGNORE\` просто проигнорирует попытку вставки дублирующих значений. Выбор подходящего решения будет зависеть от логики вашего приложения и требований к данным в вашей базе данных."},{"instruction":"привет в чем ошибка InvalidCastException: Specified cast is not valid.

В контексте вашего приложения, это означает, что происходит попытка принудительно преобразовать один тип данных в другой, но эти типы не совместимы. На практике это может происходить, например, когда вы пытаетесь привести тип данных, полученный из базы данных, к типу, ожидаемому вашим приложением, но типы данных не совпадают. Рассмотрим ситуацию на примере. Допустим, у вас есть следующий код, который пытается получить список пользователей из базы данных: \`\`\`csharp public List<User> GetUsers() { List<User> users = new List<User>(); string query = \\"SELECT * FROM users\\"; // Выполнение запроса к базе данных // Предположим, что reader - это объект SqliteDataReader while (reader.Read()) { users.Add(new User { // Предположим, ID ожидается как int, но в базе данных он хранится как string ID = (int)reader[\\"ID\\"], Name = reader[\\"Name\\"].ToString(), // Другие поля... }); } return users; } \`\`\` Если в базе данных ID пользователя хранится как строковое значение (например, \`\\"1\\"\`, \`\\"2\\"\`), а код пытается привести это значение к \`int\`, произойдет \`InvalidCastException\`, так как прямое приведение строкового типа к целому числу не является допустимым в C# без явного преобразования. Чтобы решить эту проблему, вам необходимо правильно обработать преобразование типов. В примере выше, это можно сделать следующим образом: \`\`\`csharp ID = int.Parse(reader[\\"ID\\"].ToString()), // Для случая, когда мы уверены, что значение можно преобразовать \`\`\` или используя метод \`Convert\`: \`\`\`csharp ID = Convert.ToInt32(reader[\\"ID\\"]), // Безопасный способ, который обрабатывает DBNull и другие потенциальные проблемы \`\`\` Важно тщательно проверить код на предмет операций приведения типа и убедиться, что преобразование между типами допустимо и выполняется безопасно. Возможно, в вашем случае ошибка возникает в другой части кода, не показанной в вопросе, поэтому рекомендуется внимательно изучить, где именно происходят операции приведения типа, и убедиться, что все они допустимы."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

TV를 틀 때마다 각종 예능이나 광고에서 노스트라다무스의 예언이 나왔다. 하지만 나는 이미 이 세계가 멸망하지 않는다는 것을 너무 잘 알고 있었다. ‘우유가 없네.’ 나는 우유 잔을 들고 부엌으로 향했다. 아빠가 막 욕실에서 나왔다. “성국아, 우유 더 줘?” “응, 아빠.” 아빠는 <원아저씨 보쌈>의 도시락과 족발 술안주 발매 이후 가게까지 덩달아 매출이 상승하는 바람에 아침 일찍부터 가게에 나갔다. 아르바이트생까지 두 명을 뒀지만, 사람들의 발길이 끊이지 않았다. “자, 여기.” “감사합니다.” 아빠는 방긋 웃고는 로션을 발랐다. “성국아, 아빠가 돈 많이 벌어서 휴가 때 꼭 너 보러 미국 갈게. 좋지?” “응.” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국이 이제 다 컸다고 아빠한테 뽀뽀도 안 해줄 거야?” [아빠, 난 원래 태어날 때부터 마흔 살이었다고.] 하지만 예의상이라는 게 있다. 부모 자식 간에도 예의상 해야 할 일이 있는 것이다. 나는 얼른 아빠 뺨에 뽀뽀를 날렸다. 쪽. 쪽. 쪽. 쪽. 쪽. “알았어, 이 녀석아. 그만해도 돼.” 아빠는 유쾌하게 웃으며 셔츠를 입었다. 엄마가 지희를 안고 안방에서 슬그머니 나왔다. “민국이 아직도 자?” “응, 다들 조용히 좀 해.” [민국이 이 녀석. 일곱 살이나 먹었으면 아침에 빠딱빠딱 일어나야지.] 이리저리 봐도 모자란 민국이 녀석을 두고 떠나려니 마음이 편하지 않았다. “성국아, 지희 좀 봐줄래? 엄마가 얼른 아빠랑 네 아침 차릴게.” 엄마는 지희를 바닥에 눕혔다. 지희는 민국이보다도 얌전했다. 눕혀놓으면 눕혀놓는 대로 가만히 있었다. 나는 지희 얼굴을 빤히 쳐다봤다. [하아….] 한숨이 나왔다. [지희야, 넌 대체 누굴 닮은 거야?] 나는 완벽하게 엄마, 아빠의 장점만 닮았다. 민국이도 그럭저럭 봐줄 만은 했다. 하지만 지희는 엄마, 아빠가 가진 단점만 그대로 닮았다. 엄마의 짱구 이마. 아빠의 사각 턱. 지희의 미래 플랜은 아무래도 대대적인 수정이 필요해 보였다. [머리는 똑똑한가?] 나는 얼른 지희 옆에 앉아서 동화책을 읽어주기 시작했다. 하지만 지희는 그저 몸만 바동거릴 뿐이었다. 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들며 지희를 내려다봤다. [전지희. 도대체 너, 뭐 먹고 살래?] 히죽히죽. [웃긴. 오빠님이 말씀하시잖아.] 히죽히죽. [오빠 백일 때는 이미 뭐 먹고 살지 걱정했단 말이야.] 히죽히죽. [말을 말자.] 나는 동화책을 덮어버렸다. * * * “어, 언니. 성국이한테 말해볼게.” 밥을 먹던 엄마가 전화를 끊더니 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 했던 거 기억나?” “응. ‘저스트’랑 같이 했잖아.” “와, 우리 성국이는 정말 머리가 천재인가 봐.” “엄마가 맨날 말하자나. 그건 왜?” “이번에 방송국에서 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 그 후’로 너랑 촬영을 하고 싶대. 그 감독님이 이제 곧 우리 기획사에서 하는 작품 감독도 하시잖아. 이야기하다가 의견이 나왔는데, 방송국도 좋다고 하고 ‘저스트’도 스케줄을 빼본다고 했대.” ‘저스트’는 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 이후 대박 그룹이 되었다. 특히 내가 선곡해준 <거짓이야>라는 곡은 지금까지도 회자되는 명곡이다. 마이클이라는 건방진 놈도 빠지고, 선한 영향력을 주는 아이돌 그룹이 되어서 팬덤도 대단했다. “엄마, 출연료는?” 아빠가 내 이마를 손가락으로 지그시 눌렀다. “이 녀석. 어린 게 그렇게 돈 밝히면 안 된다고 아빠가 그랬잖아.” “경제관념이 밝은 거야.” 나는 이제 서서히 속마음을 말로 표현하기 시작했다. “암튼 성국이, 말로는 이길 수가 없어.” “성국아, 이 프로그램 하고 가는 게 어떨까? 엄마 생각에는 성국이가 공부하러 가기 전에 찍고 가면 우리 가족들이 성국이 그리울 때마다 이 영상 보면 될 것 같아서 해봤으면 좋겠어.” “우선 미팅부터 해볼래.” “그래, 이따 오후에 감독님이 사무실로 온다니까 같이 가보자.” “응!” * * * “성국아, 이게 얼마 만이야. 언제 이렇게 큰 거야?” “안녕하세요, 감독님.” “나 기억나?” “잘은 안 나요.” 나는 거짓말을 했다. 내가 기억을 못 할 리가 없었다. 하지만 두 돌쯤 만난 사람을 여덟 살에 기억하는 아이는 많지 않았다. “이 녀석, 천재라고 소문이 자자하던데, 나도 기억 못 하고. 서운한데.” “죄송합니다.” “와, 말도 못 했는데… 이제 말도 잘하고. 영어랑 프랑스어도 잘한다며?” “네.” 감독은 몇 년 사이에 머리가 한결 가벼워졌다. 모자로 대충 가리고 있었지만, 이마가 넓어졌다. “참, 김 대표가 그러던데. 성국아, 네가 요리 경연 프로그램 아이디어 냈다며?” “아빠가 하시는 것 보니까 재미있어서요.” “성국아, 네 기획으로 우리가 이번에 프로그램 계획 중이야. 잘되면 기획에 네 이름 올라갈 거야.” [저작권 좀 챙기는 건가….] 나는 방긋이 웃었다. “감사해요.” 돈 이야기는 따로 하지 않았다. 이제 돈 이야기를 하면 마냥 순순해 보이지만은 않은 나이가 됐다. “감독님, 커피 한 잔 하시면서 이야기하세요. 성국이 오자마자 쉴 새 없이 말씀하신다는 거 아세요?” 김미영이 요령 있게 감독을 내게서 떼 갔다. [겨우 한숨 돌렸네.] 어릴 적에야 말도 못 하고, 발음도 어눌하니 속으로 이런저런 말을 내뱉었지만 나이가 들면서 말하는 게 조심스러워졌다. 불쑥불쑥 내뱉던 속마음이 터져 나올 것 같아서였다. “성국아, 이제 같이 회의할까?” “네!” 나는 얼른 회의실로 들어갔다. “성국이는 우유.” 김미영 대표가 우유를 내밀었다. 엄마는 얼른 커피를 감독과 스태프 몇 명에게 돌렸다. “감독님, 정말 너무 오랜만에 뵈어요.” “성국이 동생이 또 태어났다면서요?” “네, 곧 백일이에요.” “그 녀석도 정말 한 인물 하겠네요.” “딸이에요. 아직 백일이라 잘 모르겠어요, 저희는.” 그 말인즉슨, 지희의 인물은 나와 민국이. 즉, 우리와 비교할 게 아니란 말이었다. 감독은 커피를 마시며 기획안을 몇 개 돌렸다. “이번에 성국이랑 ‘저스트’의 재회편 한번 보세요.” 스태프들과 김미영, 엄마와 나는 감독이 돌린 기획안을 얼른 훑었다. 이야기는 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 7년 후’라는 콘셉트이었다. ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 당시 무명에 가까웠던 그룹 저스트. 그리고 겨우 두 돌에 가까워진 나의 7년 후 삶이 얼마나 변했는지를 쫓는 이야기였다. ‘저스트’는 대한민국의 국민 아이돌이 되었다. 하지만 지금은 계약 기간이 끝나고 범선을 비롯한 몇 명의 멤버들이 다른 기획사로 이적했다. 일반적인 보이 밴드의 해체 수순을 맞은 것이다. 그리고 나에 대한 이야기는 간략했다. 어린 나이에 천애 고아가 된 부모 밑에서 태어난 나는 뛰어난 외모와 재능으로 대중들의 마음을 사로잡고 종종 모델 활동을 하던 중에 대중들의 시야에서 사라진다. 하지만 그사이에 나는 천재라는 말을 들을 정도로 언어와 각종 분야에서 두각을 나타내고 효진 그룹의 준호 재단 첫 후원자로 미국 유학을 앞두고 있다는 내용이었다. 나는 문득 궁금한 사람이 있었다. “감독님, 마이클은요?” “마이클? 성국아, 너 마이클은 기억하니?” 아차. 하지만 이럴 때는 태연하게 대처하면 된다. “비디오테이프 봤어요.” “역시 천재는 비범하네. 마이클 뭐 하지?” 감독이 스태프 중 한 명을 쳐다봤다. 구성 작가인 듯 보였다. “저희도 안 그래도 수소문했는데요.” “뭔 사고 친 건 아니지?” “자잘한 사고는 쳤고요. 다행히 얼마 전부터 이태원에서 미국식 수제 버거집 운영하고 있어요. 나름 평가도 좋네요.” “마음 잡았나 보네.” “결혼도 했어요.” 마이클의 인생은 저번 생에서 지켜본 것과는 조금 달라졌다. 일찍 ‘저스트’를 탈퇴하고 우여곡절을 겪고 사람이 됐나 보다. “감독님, 마이클 만나고 싶어요.” “성국아, 진심이야?” “네. 옛날 비디오 보니까 마이클이랑 저랑 맨날 싸워서요. 애기가 그러면 안 되는 건데, 사과하고 싶어요.” “저희가 종종 옛날 비디오 애들한테 보여 주거든요.” 엄마가 설명을 해줬다. “성국아, 네가 사과할 일은 없어. 마이클이 다 너 괴롭힌 거야.” [감독, 알지. 나 다 기억한다고. 근데 그렇게 하면 프로그램이 되겠어, 어디.] “저도 마이클 괴롭힌 거 같아요.” 나는 그저 방긋 웃었다. 감독은 볼펜으로 머리를 슥슥 긁더니 구성 작가를 쳐다봤다. “마이클과 성국이의 화해의 장 같은 거 만들어볼까? 그 김에 다른 멤버들과의 화해의 장 같은 것도 만들고. 어때?” “괜찮은데요. 근데 마이클이 하려고 할까요?” “이태원에서 수제 버거집 한다며. 요즘 경기 어려운데 방송 나오면 광고도 되고 좋지. ‘저스트’ 멤버들도 결국 다 찢어진 건데, 지들 광고할 수 있다니까 다 나온다는 거 아니야.” “한번 접촉해 볼게요.” “성국이 덕분에 아이템 하나 건졌네.” 감독은 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. * * * “아기 바구니와 다섯 남자 7년 후요?” “네, 마이클 씨.” 구성 작가는 진땀을 빼고 있었다. 이태원의 수제 버거집을 운영한다는 마이클의 성격은 하나도 바뀌지 않았다. “제가 그 프로 때문에 얼마나 욕을 먹었는데요. 나가고 싶겠어요? 더군다나 사생활까지 밝혀져서 그룹에서도 거의 쫓겨나다시피 나왔잖아요.” “그래서요. 그룹 멤버들과 화해의 장, 이런 거 만들면 좋을 것 같아서요.” “말이 되는 소리를 해요. 저 나가도 한 명도 안부 전화 한 통 없었어요.” 마이클은 수제 버거의 패티를 뒤집으며 투덜거렸다. “그런 오해, 서로 풀어보자는 거죠.” “됐어요. 장사도 안 되는데 귀찮게 마시고 가세요.” “그러니까 더 나오셔야죠.” 마이클이 구성 작가를 쳐다봤다. “장사 어렵잖아요. 저희 콘셉트가 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 7년 후잖아요. 다큐식으로 그간의 여정과 지금 삶의 모습을 따라갈 거거든요. 그럼 이 가게. 마이클 씨가 지금 하고 있는 일 등이 자연스럽게 노출되죠. 광고 효과도 분명 톡톡히 얻으실 거예요. 어떠세요?” 마이클은 패티를 뒤집다 말고 구성 작가를 쳐다봤다. “좋아요. 하죠. 단, 조건이 있습니다. 먼저 이거 하나 드셔보세요.” 구성 작가는 마이클이 내민 수제 버거를 한 입 깨물었다. 육즙이 촉촉하게 배어 나오는 것이 맛이 꽤 괜찮았다. “맛있네요.” “그쵸?” “저희 가게에 ‘저스트’ 멤버들 다 왔으면 좋겠어요. 그래야 제대로 홍보되죠. 대충 저만 찍고 가는 거 다른 사람들도 다 알아요. 홍보하려고 나온 거요. 그렇게만 해주시면 전 좋아요.” 마이클은 막 타들어가는 패티를 뒤집으며 말했다.","output":"Episode 72 Dad messed up my hair. \\"You're quite decisive. Sungguk, it's your stock, so do as you please. Just don't come asking Dad for money if you end up losing.\\" \\"That won't happen.\\" I spoke calmly. Samsung stocks are like dung beetles rolling dung. They will keep rolling and growing. * * * The new year of 1999 has dawned. The study abroad process is almost finished, and all that's left is to leave the country. My family wanted to spend Jihee's 100th day together, so we postponed the departure date to after Jihee's 100th day. I woke up at 7 AM, had a warm glass of milk, and searched for stock and world news on my laptop. Although it was obviously not yet time to overcome the IMF crisis, the overall economy was reviving. \\"Hmm... Is this year the end of the world that Nostradamus talked about...\\" I chuckled to myself. Every time I turned on the TV, various variety shows and commercials mentioned Nostradamus's prophecy. But I knew too well that this world would not end. \\"I'm out of milk.\\" I took my empty glass and headed to the kitchen. Dad had just come out of the bathroom. \\"Sungguk, more milk?\\" \\"Sure, Dad.\\" Dad had been busy since early morning because the sales at his store, <Uncle Won's Bossam>, soared after launching a lunchbox and pork hocks as a drinking snack. Even though he hired two part-timers, the customers never stopped coming. \\"Here you go.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Dad smiled and applied lotion. \\"Sungguk, Dad will make a lot of money and definitely visit you in the U.S. during the holiday. Sounds good?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded. \\"Sungguk, are you too grown up to give Dad a kiss now?\\" [Dad, I was born a forty-year-old.] But there's such a thing as courtesy. Even between parents and children, there are things you do out of courtesy. I quickly pecked Dad on the cheek. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. \\"Alright, that's enough, you.\\" Dad laughed heartily and put on his shirt. Mom came out of the master bedroom, holding Jihee. \\"Is Minkuk still sleeping?\\" \\"Yeah, everyone, please be quiet.\\" [Minkuk, you're seven years old. You should be waking up bright and early.] Leaving behind Minkuk, who seemed to lack in many areas, made me feel uneasy. \\"Sungguk, can you watch Jihee for a bit? Mom will quickly prepare breakfast with Dad.\\" Mom laid Jihee down on the floor. Jihee was even more well-behaved than Minkuk. She stayed still wherever she was laid down. I stared at Jihee's face. [Sigh...] I sighed. [Jihee, who do you take after?] I perfectly inherited only the good traits from Mom and Dad. Minkuk was somewhat okay too. But Jihee seemed to have inherited only the flaws from Mom and Dad. Mom's bulging forehead. Dad's square jaw. Jihee's future plans seemed to need a major revision. [Is she smart at least?] I quickly sat next to Jihee and started reading her a fairy tale. But Jihee just wiggled her body. I shook my head and looked down at Jihee. [Jeon Jihee. What are you going to do for a living?] Giggling. [Funny. Your brother is telling you.] Giggling. [I was already worried about what I'd do for a living when I was a hundred days old.] Giggling. [Let's not talk about it.] I closed the fairy tale book. * * * \\"Oh, sister. I'll talk to Sungguk.\\" Mom hung up the phone and looked at me. \\"Sungguk, do you remember doing 'Five Men and a Baby Basket'?\\" \\"Yeah. I did it with 'Just'.\\" \\"Wow, our Sungguk is really a genius.\\" \\"Mom always says that. Why?\\" \\"This time, the broadcasting station wants to film 'Five Men and a Baby Basket: The Sequel' with you. That director is going to direct a project at our agency soon. While discussing, the idea came up, and the broadcasting station and 'Just' are trying to make room in their schedule.\\" 'Just' became a hit group after 'Five Men and a Baby Basket.' Especially the song <It's a Lie> that I chose for them is still considered a classic to this day. Michael, that arrogant guy, left, and they became an idol group that exerts a positive influence, so their fandom was incredible. \\"Mom, what about the appearance fee?\\" Dad pressed his finger against my forehead. \\"This kid. You shouldn't be so keen on money at your age, Dad told you.\\" \\"It's being financially savvy.\\" I began to express my inner thoughts more openly. \\"Anyway, Sungguk, you can't win with words.\\" \\"Sungguk, how about doing this program before you go? Mom thinks it would be nice for our family to watch this video whenever we miss Sungguk before he goes to study.\\" \\"Let's have a meeting first.\\" \\"Okay, the director will come to the office this afternoon, so let's go together.\\" \\"Okay!\\" * * * \\"Sungguk, how long has it been? When did you get so big?\\" \\"Hello, Director.\\" \\"Do you remember me?\\" \\"Not really.\\" I lied. There was no way I couldn't remember. But it's rare for a child to remember someone they met around their second birthday at the age of eight. \\"This kid, I heard you're a genius, but you don't remember me. I'm hurt.\\" \\"I'm sorry.\\" \\"Wow, you can even speak well now. And I heard you're good at English and French?\\" \\"Yes.\\" The director had lost quite a bit of hair in a few years. He was casually covering it with a hat, but his forehead had widened. \\"By the way, Kim CEO mentioned that you came up with the idea for a cooking competition program?\\" \\"I thought it was interesting watching Dad do it.\\" \\"Sungguk, we're planning a program based on your idea. If it goes well, your name will be on the planning.\\" [I wonder if they'll take care of the copyright...] I smiled broadly. \\"Thank you.\\" We didn't talk about money. I had reached an age where talking about money wouldn't make me look simply innocent. \\"Director, have a cup of coffee and talk. You know Sungguk just got here and you haven't stopped talking?\\" Kim Miyoung skillfully diverted the director's attention from me. [I finally caught a break.] When I was younger, I couldn't speak and my pronunciation was unclear, so I would blurt out various thoughts internally, but as I grew older, I became cautious about speaking. I was afraid that my inner thoughts would burst out uncontrollably. \\"Sungguk, shall we have a meeting now?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I quickly entered the meeting room. \\"Sungguk, here's your milk.\\" CEO Kim Miyoung handed me a glass of milk. Mom quickly served coffee to the director and a few staff members. \\"Director, it's really been too long.\\" \\"Sungguk's sibling was born, right?\\" \\"Yes, it's almost 100 days.\\" \\"That kid will surely be quite a character.\\" What that meant was, Jihee's character couldn't be compared to mine and Minkuk's. In other words, we shouldn't compare her to us. The director sipped his coffee and passed around a few proposals. \\"Take a look at this reunion episode with Sungguk and 'Just'.\\" Staff members, Kim Miyoung, Mom, and I quickly skimmed through the proposals the director handed out. The story was about 'Five Men and a Baby Basket 7 Years Later.' The group Just, which was almost unknown during 'Five Men and a Baby Basket,' and me, who was almost two years old at the time, how our lives have changed after 7 years. 'Just' became the nation's idol group in South Korea. However, now their contract period has ended, and several members, including Beomseon, have moved to other agencies. It was the typical disbandment process of a boy band. And the story about me was brief. Born under parents who were orphaned at a young age, I captivated the public's heart with my outstanding appearance and talent, occasionally engaging in modeling activities before disappearing from the public eye. Meanwhile, I was recognized as a genius, excelling in languages and various fields, and became the first sponsor of the Junho Foundation of the Hyojin Group, preparing to study abroad in the U.S. I suddenly became curious about someone. \\"Director, what about Michael?\\" \\"Michael? Sungguk, do you remember Michael?\\" Oops. But in such cases, it's best to stay calm. \\"I saw the videotape.\\" \\"Indeed, a genius is extraordinary. What's Michael doing?\\" The director looked at one of the staff members. It seemed to be a scriptwriter. \\"We've been looking for him too.\\" \\"He didn't get into any trouble, did he?\\" \\"He got into minor troubles. Fortunately, he's been running an American-style homemade burger shop in Itaewon recently. It's quite well-reviewed.\\" \\"He seems to have settled down.\\" \\"He's married too.\\" Michael's life had changed a bit from what I had observed in my previous life. He left 'Just' early, went through ups and downs, and became a decent person. \\"Director, I want to meet Michael.\\" \\"Sungguk, are you serious?\\" \\"Yes. I saw in the old video that Michael and I always fought. It's not right for a baby to do that, so I want to apologize.\\" \\"We often show the old videos to the kids.\\" Mom explained. \\"Sungguk, you don't have to apologize. Michael was the one who bullied you.\\" [Director, I know. I remember everything. But would that make for a good program, huh?] \\"I think I also bullied Michael.\\" I just smiled broadly. The director scratched his head with a pen and looked at the scriptwriter. \\"Shall we create a scene of reconciliation between Michael and Sungguk? While we're at it, let's also create scenes of reconciliation with other members. What do you think?\\" \\"That sounds good. But would Michael be willing to do it?\\" \\"He's running a homemade burger shop in Itaewon. The economy is tough these days, so appearing on the show would be good advertising. 'Just' members are ultimately all split up, but if they can advertise themselves, they'll all come.\\" \\"Let's try contacting him.\\" \\"Thanks to Sungguk, we've got an item.\\" The director patted my head. * * * \\"Five Men and a Baby Basket 7 Years Later?\\" \\"Yes, Mr. Michael.\\" The scriptwriter was sweating. Michael's personality, who was running a homemade burger shop in Itaewon, hadn't changed at all. \\"Do you know how much I was criticized because of that show? Do you think I'd want to go? Moreover, my private life was exposed, and I was almost kicked out of the group.\\" \\"That's why. Let's resolve those misunderstandings and create a scene of reconciliation.\\" \\"Talk sense. Not a single one of them called me after I left.\\" Michael flipped the burger patty while grumbling. \\"Let's resolve those misunderstandings and misunderstandings.\\" \\"Fine. But I have a condition. First, try this.\\" The scriptwriter took a bite of the homemade burger Michael offered. The juicy patty was quite delicious. \\"It's good.\\" \\"Right?\\" \\"I want 'Just' members to come to our shop. That's the proper way to promote. Everyone knows if you just film me and leave, it's for promotion.

[전지희. 너는 이 전성국 동생으로 태어난 이상, 인생 빡세게 살 각오 해야 할 거야.] * * * 1998년 12월 11일 금요일. 정식으로 아빠와 수유점 사장님이 합동으로 개발한 <원아저씨 보쌈>의 도시락과 혼술 족발 안주가 효진 푸드의 이름을 걸고 전국의 편의점과 마트에 전시되는 날이다. 아빠와 엄마 그리고 나와 민국이. 유모차에 탄 지희까지 우리 가족 모두는 아파트 상가에 있는 효진 푸드 편의점을 찾았다. 그런데 어디에도 아빠의 <원아저씨 보쌈> 상품은 보이지 않았다. “아직 도착을 안 했나….” 아빠는 실망한 기색이 역력했다. [아빠, 나만 믿어.] 나는 얼른 계산대로 가서 까치발을 세우고 물었다. “사장님.” “나, 사장 아니고 알바인데.” “알바님, <원아저씨 보쌈> 도시락이랑 족발이 안 보여서요.” “그게 뭔데?” [하아, 이 가게 알바인 네가 알아야지, 내가 어떻게 알아!] 삼전 그룹 후계자일 때 너 같은 알바 만났으면 정말 인생 앞날이 캄캄하게 만들어버릴 수 있었는데. 나는 화를 가라앉히며 다시 물었다. “한번 찾아봐 주시겠어요? 효진 푸드에서 나온 거예요. 오늘 나온다고 했어요.” “진짜 애가 가지가지 오만 가지 시키네.” 알바는 투덜거리면서 창고로 들어갔다. 이때, 사장으로 보이는 중년의 남자가 들어서더니 진열대를 살폈다. “영석아, 효진 푸드에서 나온 음식, 왜 진열 안 돼 있어? 회사에서 오늘 저녁에 관리자 돈다고 했어.” “지금 진열하려고요.” “아이고, 내 속이 터진다, 터져.” 사장은 못마땅한 얼굴로 중얼거렸다. 그러곤 나를 쳐다봤다. “아이고, 잘생겼네, 고 녀석. 뭐 찾아?” “<원아저씨 보쌈>에서 나온 도시락이랑 족발이요.” “어, 지금 진열할 거야. 근데 너 그거 어떻게 알아? 오늘 나온 건데.” 난 아빠를 자랑스럽게 가리켰다. “저희 아빠가 개발한 거예요.” “어? 여기 상가에 있는 <원아저씨 보쌈>에서 했다더니 진짜인가 보네.” 사장은 얼른 아빠에게 다가갔다. “오가며 저도 몇 번 시켜 먹었는데, 그 집 보쌈, 안 그래도 맛있다고 생각했어요.” “감사합니다.” 아빠는 쑥스러운 듯 머리를 긁적였다. 이때, 알바생이 <원아저씨 보쌈>의 도시락과 족발을 가지고 나왔다. “이런! 이웃 가게에서 만들다니…. 맨 앞에 전시할게요.” “감사합니다!” 내가 소리치자 민국이도 따라 소리쳤다. “감싸합니다!” “아이고, 애들도 이쁘네. 니들 사탕 줄까?” “밍구기 딸기맛 사탕 좋아해요.” 편의점 사장이 사탕을 가지러 간 사이에 아빠는 기분 좋게 여섯 개의 도시락과 술안주 할 족발 세 개까지 야무지게 챙기고 맥주와 소주도 담아 계산대로 갔다. “사장님, 이거 계산해 주세요.” “이거 개발하면서 많이 드셨죠?” “네. 그래도 사장님 매상도 올리고 앞으로도 진열 잘 부탁드린다는 의미로요.” “당연하죠. 아파트 상가에 있는 <원아저씨 보쌈>집에서 만든 거라고 내가 홍보 엄청 할게요.” “감사합니다.” 나는 얼른 과자와 우유 몇 개까지 계산대 위에 올렸다. “아빠, 계산.” [이 정도는 매상 팍팍 올려줘야지.] 엄마도 평소 같으면 편의점에서 사지도 않는 기저귀까지 계산대에 올렸다. “사장님, 이것도요.” “우리 매상도 이렇게 올려주시니, 진짜 <원아저씨 보쌈> 대박 났으면 좋겠네요.” * * * <원아저씨 보쌈> 도시락으로 저녁상이 차려졌다. 김미영이 사온 도시락까지 해서 내일 저녁까지는 보쌈 도시락을 먹어야 할 판이었다. “저도 동네 마트랑 편의점 싹 돌았는데, 맨 앞에 전시되어 있어서 너무 기분 좋더라고요.” “부끄럽네요. 김 대표님, 한 잔 하세요.” 아빠는 김미영 대표의 잔에 맥주를 따랐다. “아빠, 난 우유.” “밍구기는 딸기 우유.” “이 녀석들 자기주장 확실하네.” 아빠는 얼른 나와 민국이의 잔에도 우유를 따라줬다. “참, 성국아. 너 다음 달이면 출국이지?” “네.” 드디어 유학길에 오를 날이 정해졌다. 9월부터 시작하는 미국 학기 전에 적응을 위해서 1월에 출국해서 짧은 어학 코스를 밟을 예정이었다. 엄마는 옆에서 벌써부터 걱정 가득한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 엄마 성국이 보고 싶어서 어쩌지.” “엄마가 미국 오면 되지.” 나는 담담하게 말했다. [어차피 크면 다 품 떠나는 게 자식이야, 엄마.] 더 큰 세상에 나가기 위해서는 대한민국에 머무를 수만은 없었다. 아빠가 좀 시무룩한 얼굴로 맥주를 마셨다. “아빠도 성국이 엄청 보고 싶을 거 같아.” “형아, 밍구기도. 밍구기도 가고 싶어.” “민국아, 넌 좀 더 공부를 잘해야 해. 형아 없는 동안 공부 열심히 하고 있어.” [없는 집에서 성공하려면 공부를 뛰어나게 잘하든, 특출한 재능이 있든가 해야 하는 거야.] 나는 민국이 머리를 쓰다듬었다. 민국이는 거의 울 듯한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. 이전에는 이 얼굴에 마음이 약해져서 미국 유학을 포기했다. 하지만 이제 그럴 수 없었다. 대한민국 교육은 나를 담기에는 그릇이 작았다. 이때, 아빠 핸드폰이 울렸다. 신파로 흐르는 흐름을 막아주는 적절한 타이밍의 전화였다. “여보세요. 네, 부장님.” 효진 푸드 구성현 부장인 모양이었다. “벌써 그런 게 집계가 되나요? 첫날인데요.” 전화를 받는 아빠의 표정이 점점 밝아졌다. “이렇게 신경 써주셔서 감사합니다. 네, 부장님도 좋은 주말 되세요.” 아빠는 전화를 끊고, 뿌듯한 얼굴로 가족들을 쳐다봤다. “<원아저씨 보쌈>이 오늘 발매한 간편식 중에서 2등 했대요.” “진짜?” “응.” 아빠는 쑥스러운 듯 고개를 끄덕였다. 그 와중에도 미소는 점점 얼굴에 번졌다. 나는 얼른 아빠에게 가서 안겨서 등을 도닥였다. [아빠, 그동안 수고했어. 이제 나도 마음 편하게 미국 갈 수 있겠어. 아빠 이렇게 성장시키느라 지난 8년 동안 나 정말 힘들었어.] 울컥. 지난 8년의 고생을 생각하니 갑자기 눈물이 벅차올랐다. “성국아, 우는 거야?” “응.” “왜? 아빠가 잘돼서 기분 좋아서?” “응.” 대답은 그렇게 하고, 주마등처럼 지나가는 내 고생을 떠올렸다. 원룸에서 시작해서 잠실 아파트까지. 민국이도 사람 만들고, 이제 아빠 일도 자리를 잡아갔다. 내가 미국 가 있을 동안 가족들 손가락 빨 일은 적어도 없을 거 같았다. 지희가 꼬물거리면서 히죽거렸다. [그래, 지희야. 나 미국 가 있는 동안 무럭무럭 잘 자라서 보자. 오빠가 돌아와서 너도 밥벌이 제대로 하게 해줄게.] 아빠가 내 등을 도닥이며 안았다. “성국아, 아빠 고생을 네가 알아주다니 아빠도 감동이야.” [아빠 고생 말고, 내 고생.] * * * 엄마도 오랜만에 마신 맥주 한 잔에 얼굴이 붉어졌다. 다들 기분이 좋아진 가운데, 민국이는 이미 거실에서 꾸벅꾸벅 졸았다. 아빠가 민국이를 안고 일어났다. “민국이는 내가 재울게. 김 대표님, 오늘 한 잔 더 해야 하니까 좀만 기다리세요.” “그럴게요.” “언니, 그럼 저도 얼른 지희 재우고 올게요. 우리끼리 진짜 오랜만에 한잔해요.” “성국이도!” 나는 얼른 우유를 마시며 손을 들었다. “성국이 넌 자야지.” “하아, 어른들은 너무해.” “성국이는 좀 더 놀게 하자. 나 성국이랑 할 이야기도 있어.” [무슨 이야기?] 나는 김미영 대표를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 니가 저번에 말한 음식 프로그램 경연 말이야.” “네.” “<다섯 남자와 아기 바구니> 하셨던 감독님이 몇 년 전에 프리로 선언하시면서 나왔거든. 그동안 IMF 때문에 힘드셨는데, 우리 아이템 좋다고 같이 해보자고 하셔.” [내 촉은 틀리지 않는다고.] 나는 가만히 김미영의 다음 말을 기다렸다. “그래서 당분간 매니지먼트를 쉬고 제작사로 전환하려고 하거든.” [김 대표, 뜸 들이지 말고 어서 다음 이야기를 해봐.] “성국아, 난 네가 가진 능력이 좀 남다른 거 같아. 미국 가서 하고 싶은 공부 많이 하고, 엔터테인먼트 업계 공부 해보면 어떨까 싶어서.” 이번에는 내 눈이 반짝였다. 확실히 김미영은 삼전 기획 경리부에서 썩기에는 아까운 사람이었다. “앞으로 우리나라도 연예계 업계가 더 커질 거고, 지금처럼 주먹구구로 하는 시스템에 많이 변화가 올 것 같아. 넌 어릴 적에 아역으로 일도 해봤고, 이 업계 일을 경험해 봤잖아. 한번 잘 생각해봐.” “조언 감사해요.” 나는 깍듯하게 감사의 말을 전했다. 김미영 대표는 맥주를 마시며 빙긋 웃었다. “성국아, 정말 너랑 대화하다 보면 회사에서 높은 분이랑 대화하는 것 같단 말이야, 꼭.” [당연하지. 나 전직 삼전 그룹 회장이야.] 나는 그저 미소를 지었다. 엄마와 아빠가 민국이와 지희를 재우고 나왔다. 나도 슬슬 자리를 떠줘야 할 타이밍이었다. “엄마, 성국이도 잘래.” “성국아, 양치해야지.” [치카치카 시르다.] 나는 엄마 손에 끌려 욕실로 들어갔다. * * * “끝도 없이 추락할 것만 같은 코스피 지수가 상승세를 타고 있습니다. 대한민국은 빠르게 IMF 부채를 갚는 중이고, 수출 흑자는 사상 최대치입니다.” 뉴스에서 기분 좋은 소식이 흘러나왔다. 내가 바닥에서 줍듯이 산 삼전 주식이 가파른 상승 곡선을 그리는 것은 당연했다. 뉴스를 보던 아빠가 허리를 바로 세웠다. “성국아, 저것 봐. 삼전 주식 장난 아니게 올랐어.” [아빠, 나만 믿으라니까.] “성국아, 너 비상금 필요할지 모르니까 조금 팔까?” 나는 팔을 딱 낀 채 고개를 절레절레 저었다. 삼전은 장투다. 나는 삼전 주식의 끝을 이미 알고 있다.","output":"Episode 71 Finally, the day had arrived. The day our third child was born. Mom had been in labor since the morning, and after lunchtime, she grabbed my hand and we headed to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic. Dad closed the store to come, and CEO Kim Mi-young was with us too. Since my aunt was looking after Min-guk, I waited anxiously for the birth of the third child with Dad and CEO Kim Mi-young in front of the delivery room. Dad kept pacing back and forth in front of the delivery room. \\"Mr. Sung-guk, please sit and wait.\\" \\"It feels like it's been a long time since she went into the delivery room, why haven't we heard anything?\\" \\"It hasn't even been an hour yet.\\" \\"Is that so...\\" [Dad, calm down.] I shook my head in disbelief. Although we occasionally heard screams from the hallway, we waited calmly. I had experienced childbirth twice in my previous life. This was Dad's third time, so he should have been better at this than me, but he was restless. Then, the door to the delivery room opened, and a nurse came out. \\"You're Kim So-young's guardian, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"The baby is almost out. If you want to cut the umbilical cord, come in with me.\\" \\"Of course, I'll cut it.\\" Dad hurried into the delivery room. Kim Mi-young looked at me with a happy face. \\"Sung-guk, you have a baby sister.\\" [Should I be happy?] I wasn't happy at all. Dad was just managing one pork wrap shop, and we were barely starting to prepare ready-to-eat meals. They were to be launched by the end of the year, so the revenue would probably be seen next year, and now there was one more child. Mom worked at SKJ Entertainment, where I was signed, but she had to take her hands off work for a while because of childcare. Moreover, SKJ Entertainment was trying to change its business type to a production company after Song Hye-sun left, so there was hardly any income at the moment. Min-guk was barely making his own living... And now a third child.... It really was a mountain beyond a mountain, and a tree with many branches has no calm days. The nurse came out again and gestured to me and Kim Mi-young. \\"You can see the baby in the newborn room. It's a girl.\\" Kim Mi-young held my hand tightly and headed to the newborn room. There was a little blood bundle beyond the glass. I pressed my forehead against the glass. [Jeon Ji-hee. Since you were born as the sister of this Jeon Sung-guk, you should be prepared to live a tough life.] * * * December 11, 1998, Friday. It was the official day when the <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> lunchbox and solo-drinking pig's feet snack, jointly developed by Dad and the owner of the nursing home, were displayed in convenience stores and supermarkets nationwide under the name of Hyo-jin Food. Dad, Mom, me, Min-guk, and even Ji-hee in the stroller, our whole family visited the Hyo-jin Food convenience store in the apartment complex. But Dad's <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> products were nowhere to be seen. \\"Maybe they haven't arrived yet....\\" Dad looked visibly disappointed. [Dad, just trust me.] I quickly went to the counter and stood on tiptoe to ask. \\"Excuse me.\\" \\"I'm not the owner, I'm just a part-timer.\\" \\"Part-timer, I can't see the <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> lunchbox and pig's feet.\\" \\"What's that?\\" [Sigh, you're the part-timer here, you should know, not me!] If I were still the heir to the Samjeon Group, I could have made your future bleak. I calmed down and asked again. \\"Could you please check? It's from Hyo-jin Food. It was supposed to be released today.\\" \\"Kids these days ask for everything.\\" The part-timer grumbled and went into the storage room. Then, a middle-aged man who seemed to be the owner came in and looked around the display. \\"Yeong-seok, why isn't the food from Hyo-jin Food displayed? The company said they'd check tonight.\\" \\"I was about to display it.\\" \\"Oh, my stomach is going to burst.\\" The owner muttered discontentedly and then looked at me. \\"Hey, handsome boy, what are you looking for?\\" \\"The lunchbox and pig's feet from <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap>.\\" \\"Oh, we're about to display it. But how did you know? It was released today.\\" I proudly pointed at my dad. \\"My dad developed it.\\" \\"Oh? I heard it was from <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> in our complex, so it's true.\\" The owner quickly approached my dad. \\"I've ordered from there a few times, thinking the pork wrap was really good.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Dad scratched his head shyly. Then, the part-timer came out with the <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> lunchbox and pig's feet. \\"Oh! It's made by the store next door.... I'll display it at the front.\\" \\"Thank you!\\" I shouted, and Min-guk followed suit. \\"Thank you!\\" \\"Oh, the kids are cute too. Do you want some candy?\\" \\"Min-guk likes strawberry-flavored candy.\\" While the convenience store owner went to get candy, Dad proudly picked up six lunchboxes and three pig's feet for drinking snacks, along with beer and soju, and went to the counter. \\"Owner, please ring these up.\\" \\"You must have eaten a lot while developing these, right?\\" \\"Yes. But it's also to help increase your sales and to ask for good display in the future.\\" \\"Of course. I'll promote it a lot since it's made by <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> in our apartment complex.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" I quickly put some snacks and milk on the counter. \\"Dad, pay for these.\\" [I have to help boost the sales.] Mom, who usually wouldn't buy from a convenience store, even put diapers on the counter. \\"Owner, this too, please.\\" \\"I hope <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> really hits it big since you're helping our sales like this.\\" * * * <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> lunchboxes were prepared for dinner. With the lunchboxes Kim Mi-young brought, we had to eat pork wrap lunchboxes until tomorrow's dinner. \\"I also went around the neighborhood mart and convenience store, and it felt so good to see them displayed at the front.\\" \\"It's embarrassing. CEO Kim, have a drink.\\" Dad poured beer for CEO Kim Mi-young. \\"Dad, I want milk.\\" \\"Min-guk wants strawberry milk.\\" \\"These kids are so assertive.\\" Dad quickly poured milk for me and Min-guk. \\"By the way, Sung-guk, you're leaving the country next month, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" The day I would go abroad for my studies was set. I was scheduled to leave in January to adapt before the American semester starting in September and to take a short language course. Mom looked at me with a face full of worry from the side. \\"Sung-guk, mom will miss you so much.\\" \\"Mom can come to the U.S.\\" I said calmly. [After all, children leave the nest when they grow up, Mom.] To step into a bigger world, I couldn't stay in South Korea forever. Dad drank his beer with a somewhat gloomy face. \\"Dad will miss Sung-guk a lot too.\\" \\"Brother, Min-guk too. Min-guk wants to go too.\\" \\"Min-guk, you need to study harder. Study hard while your brother is away.\\" [To succeed from a humble background, you either need to study exceptionally well or have a special talent.] I patted Min-guk's head. Min-guk looked at me almost tearfully. In the past, I gave up going to the U.S. because of that face. But I couldn't do that anymore. South Korean education was too small a vessel to contain me. Then, Dad's phone rang. It was a timely call that interrupted the melodramatic flow. \\"Hello. Yes, Manager.\\" It seemed to be Manager Goo Seong-hyeon from Hyo-jin Food. \\"Can you already tally that? It's the first day.\\" Dad's expression brightened as he took the call. \\"Thank you for taking care of it. Yes, have a good weekend too, Manager.\\" Dad hung up and looked at his family with a proud face. \\"<Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> ranked second among the convenience foods released today.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Dad nodded shyly, but his smile spread across his face. I quickly hugged Dad and patted his back. [Dad, you've worked hard. Now I can go to the U.S. with peace of mind. Dad, I've really struggled to grow you up over the past 8 years.] I choked up. Thinking about the hardships of the past 8 years suddenly brought tears to my eyes. \\"Sung-guk, are you crying?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Why? Are you happy because Dad is doing well?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I answered that way, but I recalled my struggles flashing before my eyes. From a one-room apartment to a Jamsil apartment. I made Min-guk a decent person, and now Dad's business was starting to settle. It seemed there would be no need for my family to worry while I was in the U.S. Ji-hee giggled and squirmed. [Yes, Ji-hee. Grow well while I'm in the U.S. When I come back, I'll make sure you can earn your keep too.] Dad hugged me and patted my back. \\"Sung-guk, Dad is moved that you recognize his hard work.\\" [Not Dad's hard work, my hard work.] * * * Mom's face turned red after a rare drink of beer. Everyone was in a good mood, and Min-guk was already dozing off in the living room. Dad stood up with Min-guk in his arms. \\"I'll put Min-guk to bed. CEO Kim, please wait a bit longer for another drink.\\" \\"Sure.\\" \\"Then I'll quickly put Ji-hee to bed too. Let's have a real drink together for the first time in a while.\\" \\"Sung-guk too!\\" I quickly drank my milk and raised my hand. \\"Sung-guk should go to bed.\\" \\"Ah, adults are so unfair.\\" \\"Let Sung-guk stay up a bit longer. I have something to talk to him about.\\" [What do you want to talk about?] I looked at CEO Kim Mi-young. \\"Sung-guk, about the food competition program you mentioned last time.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"The director who did <Five Men and a Baby Basket> declared himself freelance a few years ago and left. He's had a tough time since the IMF, but he said he likes our item and wants to work on it together.\\" [My intuition is never wrong.] I quietly waited for Kim Mi-young's next words. \\"So, I'm thinking of taking a break from management and transitioning to a production company.\\" [CEO Kim, don't beat around the bush and continue.] \\"Sung-guk, I think you have a special talent. How about studying a lot in the U.S., including the entertainment industry?\\" My eyes sparkled. Kim Mi-young was indeed too good to waste away in the accounting department of Samjeon Planning. \\"I think the entertainment industry in our country will grow even more, and the current makeshift system will undergo many changes. You've worked as a child actor and experienced this industry. Think about it.\\" \\"Thank you for the advice.\\" I politely expressed my gratitude. Kim Mi-young drank her beer and smiled broadly. \\"Sung-guk, talking to you feels like I'm talking to a high-ranking executive at a company, really.\\" [Of course. I'm the former chairman of Samjeon Group.] I just smiled. Mom and Dad came back after putting Min-guk and Ji-hee to bed. It was time for me to leave the spot. \\"Mom, Sung-guk will go to bed too.\\" \\"Sung-guk, you need to brush your teeth.\\" [Brush, brush, Sir.] I was dragged into the bathroom by Mom. * * * \\"The KOSPI index, which seemed to be in endless decline, is on the rise. South Korea is rapidly repaying its IMF debt, and export surpluses are at an all-time high.\\" The news broadcasted good news. It was natural for the Samjeon stocks I picked up from the bottom to draw a steep upward curve. Dad straightened up as he watched the news. \\"Sung-guk, look at that. Samjeon's stock has risen incredibly.\\" [Dad, just trust me.] \\"Sung-guk, should we sell a bit in case you need emergency funds?\\" I firmly shook my head. Samjeon is for long-term investment.

[살면서 장학생 한 번쯤 되는 거 아니야? 다들 공부 못했나 봐?] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “작가님, 성국이가 장학생으로 뽑힌 거면 공부를 엄청 잘한 거 아니에요?” “네. 성국이가 영어, 프랑스어는 거의 모국어처럼 하고요. 다른 학업 성취도 뛰어나요. 삼전 그룹도 엄청 탐냈다고 들었어요.” 모두들 나를 다시 쳐다봤다. [다들 그렇게 쳐다볼 필요 없어. 나 아이큐 고작 121이야. 평범한 편이라고.] “성국아, 나중에 너 뭐가 될 거야? 박사? 교수?” [그런 건 시시해서 안 해.] 나는 고개를 저었다. “엔터테인먼트 회사 하고 싶어요.” 그 말에 다들 놀라 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 정말 남다르구나.” 범선이 놀라는 사이, 달칵 문 열리는 소리가 났다. 마이클이 수염을 덥수룩하게 기른 모습으로 들어섰다. 마이클은 주머니에 손을 푹 찔러 넣은 게 여전히 불만 가득한 얼굴이었다. “어, 마이클!” 태형이 리더답게 마이클을 먼저 반겼다. “어… 형.” 마이클은 굳은 인상으로 어색하게 인사했다. [자식. 아직도 앙금이 남아 있구만.] 마이클은 나를 보더니 두툼한 손으로 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “네가 성국이구나. 많이 컸네.” [누가 할 소리. 마이클, 사람은 좀 됐어?] 문이 열리면서 커피와 간단한 스낵을 들고 김미영이 들어왔다. “이제 다 모이셨네요. 감독님이 사실 다들 인사 먼저 하고 이야기도 나누라고 좀 천천히 오신대요. 그래도 30분 안에는 오실 거예요. 커피 좀 드세요. 성국이는 우유.” [나도 진하게 내린 에스프레소 한 잔 마시고 싶다고.] 하지만 내 손은 우유를 잡고 있었다. 마이클은 내 우유를 뺏더니 입구를 손으로 열어서 빨대까지 집어넣었다. “마셔.” [마이클, 방송 탈 거라고 착한 척 연기하는 거야?] “감사합니다.” 나는 꾸벅 인사를 하고 우유를 쭉 들이켰다. “마이클, 그동안 어떻게 지냈어? 이태원에서 수제 버거집 낸 거 맞아?” 리더인 태형이 대표로 마이클에서 물어봤다. “네, 한 반년 됐어요. 장사도 그럭저럭 돼요. 다른 멤버들 소식은 간간이 연예 뉴스에서 봤어요.” 마이클은 생각 외로 덤덤하게 자기 이야기를 풀어놨다. “팀 탈퇴하고… 뭐 쫓겨나다시피 한 거지만, 그땐 화도 많이 나고 열도 받고 그래서 나쁜 일도 좀 하고….” 마이클은 ‘저스트’ 탈퇴 후 다른 그룹을 만들었지만, 곧 대마초를 피우는 바람에 그 팀마저 해체됐다. “암튼 다시 미국 가서 이 일 저 일 기웃거려 봤는데, 하고 싶은 것도 뭐, 그렇더라고요. 그 와중에 동네 수제 버거집에서 아르바이트했는데, 요리가 재미있어서 이것저것 하다가 이 길로 들어서게 됐어요.” “네 길 잘 찾았구나.” 태형이 마이클을 도닥였다. “우리도 우여곡절 많았어. 잘나갈 때야 서로 정신없었고, 해체하기 전에는 서로 의견도 갈리고 싸우기도 많이 하고… 성국이 있는데 이런 이야기 해도 되나 몰라.” 나는 괜히 손바닥으로 귀를 막는 시늉을 했다. “이 녀석, 완전 여우네.” 태형은 유쾌하게 웃고는 이야기를 이었다. “나랑 루카스, 재현이는 지금 소속사에 계속 남아서 개인 음반이나 활동 할 거 같아. 범선이는 이번에 영화 들어가.” “다들 제 갈 길 잘 가시네요. 성국아, 넌 초등학생이지?” “성국이 효진 그룹 장학재단에서 후원해서 미국에 유학 간대. 성국이 알고 보니까 천재였더라고.” “그래서 너, 나 쫓겨나게 만들었구나?” 마이클이 나를 빤히 쳐다봤다. 회의실 안은 갑자기 조용해졌다. 사실 그때의 일을 기억하는 사람들이라면 마이클의 말이 틀리지 않다는 것을 알 것이다. 앙숙으로 관계 설정이 된 마이클과 나는 꽤 인기 있는 조합이었다. 시청자들의 반응도 좋았고, 감독과 작가도 계속해서 우리를 부각시켰다. 하지만 그 시절 마이클은 싸가지 없기로는 내 전생에 비할 수가 없었고, 나는 그 꼴이 보기 싫어서 마이클의 실수를 부각시켜 그대로 아웃시켜 버렸다. 범선이 마이클을 말렸다. “야, 두 살짜리가 뭘 알았겠어. 그만해.” “아니. 난 얘가 두 살이 아니라 꼭 마흔쯤 먹은 아저씨 같았다니까. 암튼 그랬다고.” “다 네가 그 일로 안 풀려서 그런 거지, 애가 뭘 안다고 그래.” “암튼 나도 다 잊었어요.” 나는 모른 척 우유를 쪽 마셨다. * * * 첫 촬영이 시작됐다. 카메라가 나를 쫓아다니며 하루를 찍는 거였다. 나는 평소대로 아침 7시에 일어나서 세수를 하고는 엄마가 따라주는 우유를 가지고 방으로 가서 노트북으로 증시 상황과 세계 뉴스를 검색했다. 옆에 있던 작가가 이런 질문을 던졌다. “성국아, 다 영어고 간혹 프랑스어 독일어도 있는데 다 해석 가능해?” “네.” 나는 기사 몇 개를 클릭해서 내용을 전반적으로 알려줬다. 오전 내내 카메라는 효진 그룹에서 제공하는 영재교육을 받는 내 모습을 담았고 담당 선생님들의 인터뷰를 땄다. 대부분 이 나이의 아이에게 있어서 굉장히 특별한 재능이고, 성국이가 일반 학교에서 적응하지 못한 이유가 이거라는 식으로 이야기를 했다. 마지막엔 카메라가 나를 메인으로 잡았다. 질문은 간단했다. “성국아, 미국 가서 공부해서 뭐가 되고 싶어?” “대한민국 엔터테인먼트 업계를 이끌어 나가고 싶어요.” “다시 배우 할 생각이야?” “아니요. 좋은 가수와 배우들을 키우고 싶어요.” 나는 배시시 웃었다. “컷!” 감독님의 사인 소리가 크게 울렸다. * * * [여기가 마이클이 하는 햄버거 가게구나.] 마이클이 하는 가게는 생각보다 협소했다. 대형 철판이 전면부에 있었고, 앉아서 먹을 수 있는 자리는 네 군데뿐이었다. 대부분 포장 손님들인 것 같았다. 나는 마이클에게 사온 금전수 화분을 내밀었다. “돈 많이 버는 나무래요.” “네가 산 거야, 성국아?” “네!” 마이클은 온화한 미소를 지었다. 아마 자막에는 ‘앙숙이었던 두 사람은 이제 친구가 되려고 합니다.’ 뭐 이렇게 나갈 것 같았다. 곧이어 ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 도착했다. 모두들 선물 하나씩 챙겨온 모습이었다. “마이클, 우리 브로마이드에 사인해서 걸어둘까?” 루카스가 마이클까지 있는 1집 대형 브로마이드를 꺼냈다. “야, 우리 이제 한물갔잖아.” 재현이 농담조로 말했다. “한물갔어도 ‘저스트’는 ‘저스트’지. 다들 사인해줘.” 마이클이 오히려 흔쾌히 찬성하자 모두들 브로마이드에 사인을 하기 시작했다. “성국이도 사인해야지.” 구성 작가가 슬그머니 예전 방송국에 걸려 있었던 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 브로마이드를 내밀었다. “와, 이거 완전 유물이잖아.” 태형이 반갑게 브로마이드를 들었다. “야, 다들 여기에도 사인해. 성국아, 너두 사인해야지.” “네!” 나는 얼른 펜을 들고 내 얼굴 위로 세 글자를 또박또박 썼다. -전성국. 1999년 1월 23일. 모두 사인한 대형 브로마이드 두 장이 마이클의 수제 버거집에 걸렸다. 마이클이 정성껏 구운 수제 버거를 들고 나왔다. “자, 이게 내가 미국에서 3년간 알바하며 비법 배워온 수제 버거야. 맛들 봐요.” 나는 큼지막한 수제 버거 하나를 한 입에 깨물었다. 순간 육즙이 미친 듯이 입속으로 돌진했다. [허, 이거 진짜 맛있잖아.] 마이클이 내 표정을 보더니얼른 내 옆구리를 슬쩍 찌르며 속삭였다. “성국아, 예전에 네가 나 망하게 했으니까 살리는 것도 네가 해야지.”","output":"Episode 73 Click. The meeting room door opened, and the members of 'Just' entered. Still close friends, the leader Taehyung, muscle man Lucas, and the handsome Jaehyun entered together. \\"Sungguk-ah! Is it really Sungguk?\\" \\"Yes! I'm Sungguk. Hello.\\" I greeted them with a stranger's face and a bow. Remembering an idol I saw around the age of two would be an overstatement. \\"Wow, Sungguk-ah! Do you remember us?\\" \\"Not really.\\" [I remember everything, though. But why don't I see Beomseon?] Click. As if on cue, Beomseon appeared with long hair. \\"It's been a while.\\" Taehyung greeted Beomseon. Lucas and Jaehyun seemed indifferent to Beomseon. After the disbandment, everyone was a bit bitter since Beomseon was the only one who signed with another agency. Honestly, a lot of 'Just's popularity was thanks to Beomseon. I quickly greeted Beomseon. Respectfully. With a bow. \\"Hello. I'm Sungguk.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, wow-. When did you grow up so much? How old are you now?\\" \\"I'm nine years old.\\" \\"Wow-.\\" Beomseon kept exclaiming in admiration. \\"Sungguk is nine years old. That means we've gotten that much older, right?\\" \\"No, you all look young.\\" My comment made the members burst into laughter. The atmosphere gradually warmed up. Beomseon greeted the members and talked about the movie he was preparing for. \\"It was less scary when the four of us were active together, but doing everything alone is hard. It's lonely too...\\" \\"Hyung, that's what you get for choosing acting.\\" Lucas grumbled, not unpleasantly. \\"By the way, is Michael coming today?\\" At Taehyung's words, a brief silence fell. \\"Yes, he should be coming. He said he'd be a bit late because he has to check on his store.\\" The scriptwriter quickly answered. \\"Michael has a store?\\" \\"He runs a handmade burger shop in Itaewon.\\" \\"I had no idea about Michael.\\" Taehyung looked genuinely sorry. \\"Sungguk-ah, do you remember Michael? You two used to fight all the time.\\" [Of course, I remember. I haven't forgotten a single thing about Michael bullying me.] Contrary to my thoughts, I shook my head. \\"I don't really remember.\\" \\"Well, it's probably for the best that you don't remember. Sungguk-ah, how do you get even more handsome as you grow?\\" The handsome Jaehyun smiled with his eyes as he spoke. \\"Writer, is Sungguk still active as a child actor or something?\\" \\"We were going to talk about that today. To tell you in advance, Sungguk is going to study abroad in the U.S. next month.\\" \\"Sungguk, you've made it big.\\" Muscle man Lucas patted my shoulder. \\"Sungguk became the first scholarship recipient of the Hyojin Group's Junho Foundation.\\" Everyone's eyes widened as they looked at me. [Isn't it normal to become a scholarship student at some point? Did everyone not study well?] I shrugged my shoulders. \\"Writer, if Sungguk was selected as a scholarship student, does that mean he's really good at studying?\\" \\"Yes. Sungguk is almost native in English and French. His academic achievements are outstanding too. I heard Samsung Group was really interested in him.\\" Everyone looked at me again. [There's no need to stare. My IQ is just 121. Pretty average.] \\"Sungguk-ah, what do you want to become in the future? A doctor? A professor?\\" [That's too boring for me.] I shook my head. \\"I want to run an entertainment company.\\" Everyone looked surprised at my answer. \\"Sungguk-ah, you really are different.\\" While Beomseon was surprised, the sound of the door opening was heard. Michael entered with a scruffy beard. Michael, with his hands deep in his pockets, still had a face full of dissatisfaction. \\"Hey, Michael!\\" Taehyung, being the leader, greeted Michael first. \\"Uh... hyung.\\" Michael greeted awkwardly with a stiff expression. [Kid. You still hold a grudge.] Michael then looked at me and ruffled my hair with his thick hand. \\"So you're Sungguk. You've grown a lot.\\" [Look who's talking. Michael, have you become a decent person?] As the door opened, Kim Miyoung entered with coffee and some snacks. \\"Everyone's here now. The director said to take your time greeting each other and chatting. He'll be here in about 30 minutes. Please have some coffee. Sungguk, here's some milk for you.\\" [I'd rather have a strong espresso.] But my hand was holding milk. Michael took my milk, opened the cap with his hand, and even put in a straw. \\"Drink.\\" [Michael, are you pretending to be nice because you're on camera?] \\"Thank you.\\" I bowed and gulped down the milk. \\"Michael, how have you been? Is it true you opened a handmade burger shop in Itaewon?\\" Taehyung asked Michael on behalf of everyone. \\"Yes, it's been about half a year. Business is okay. I've seen news about the other members from time to time.\\" Michael surprisingly shared his story calmly. \\"After leaving the team... well, it was more like being kicked out, but I was angry and frustrated, so I got into some trouble...\\" Michael had formed another group after leaving 'Just', but it soon disbanded when he was caught smoking marijuana. \\"Anyway, I went back to the U.S. and dabbled in this and that, but nothing really caught my interest. Then I worked part-time at a local handmade burger shop, found cooking fun, and eventually got into this line of work.\\" \\"You found your path well.\\" Taehyung comforted Michael. \\"We've had our ups and downs too. When we were doing well, we were too busy to notice each other, and before disbanding, we had our disagreements and fights... I'm not sure if it's okay to talk about this in front of Sungguk.\\" I pretended to cover my ears. \\"This kid is totally a fox.\\" Taehyung laughed pleasantly and continued the conversation. \\"Me, Lucas, and Jaehyun will probably stay with the agency and work on solo albums or activities. Beomseon is entering a movie.\\" \\"Everyone's finding their own way. Sungguk-ah, you're a primary school student, right?\\" \\"Sungguk is sponsored by the Hyojin Group's scholarship foundation to study in the U.S. Turns out Sungguk is a genius.\\" \\"So you're the one who got me kicked out?\\" Michael stared at me intently. The meeting room suddenly became quiet. If those present remembered the incident, they would know Michael's words weren't wrong. Michael and I, set up as rivals, were a popular combination. The viewers' response was good, and the director and writer continued to highlight us. But back then, Michael was insufferable, and I couldn't stand it, so I highlighted his mistake and got him kicked out. Beomseon intervened. \\"Hey, what would a two-year-old know? Stop it.\\" \\"No. I always thought he was like a forty-year-old man. Anyway, that's how it was.\\" \\"It's all because things didn't work out for you after that incident, not because of the kid.\\" \\"Anyway, I've forgotten all about it.\\" I pretended not to know and sipped my milk. * * * The first shooting began. The camera followed me around for a day. As usual, I woke up at 7 a.m., washed my face, and went to my room with the milk my mom gave me to check the stock market and world news on my laptop. The writer beside me asked a question. \\"Sungguk-ah, it's all in English, and sometimes in French and German. Can you understand all of it?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I clicked on a few articles and briefly explained their contents. Throughout the morning, the camera captured me receiving gifted education provided by the Hyojin Group and interviewed my teachers. Most said that for a child of my age, I had extraordinary talents, and the reason I couldn't adapt to regular school was precisely this. Finally, the camera focused on me. The question was simple. \\"Sungguk-ah, what do you want to become after studying in the U.S.?\\" \\"I want to lead the entertainment industry in South Korea.\\" \\"Do you plan to become an actor again?\\" \\"No. I want to nurture good singers and actors.\\" I smiled broadly. \\"Cut!\\" The director's signal sounded loudly. * * * [So this is Michael's burger shop.] Michael's shop was smaller than I expected. A large griddle was at the front, and there were only four seats for dining in. It seemed most customers preferred takeout. I handed Michael a potted money tree I brought. \\"It's said to bring wealth.\\" \\"Did you buy this, Sungguk-ah?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Michael smiled warmly. The subtitle probably read, 'The two former rivals are now trying to become friends.' Soon after, the 'Just' members arrived. Everyone brought a gift. \\"Michael, should we hang a signed poster of ours here?\\" Lucas pulled out a large poster of their first album, including Michael. \\"Hey, we're has-beens now.\\" Jaehyun joked. \\"Even if we're has-beens, 'Just' is still 'Just'. Everyone, please sign.\\" Michael surprisingly agreed, and everyone began signing the poster. \\"Sungguk should sign too.\\" The scriptwriter subtly brought out an old poster from the show 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' that used to hang at the broadcasting station. \\"Wow, this is a real relic.\\" Taehyung happily held the poster. \\"Hey, everyone sign here too. Sungguk, you should sign as well.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I quickly grabbed a pen and carefully wrote my name above my face. -Jeon Sungguk. January 23, 1999. Both posters, signed by everyone, were hung in Michael's handmade burger shop. Michael brought out handmade burgers he had prepared with care. \\"Here, this is the handmade burger I learned to make after working part-time in the U.S. for three years. Try it.\\" I took a big bite of the large handmade burger. Juices burst into my mouth like crazy. [Wow, this is really good.] Seeing my expression, Michael nudged my side and whispered. \\"Sungguk-ah, since you were the one who ruined me, you should be the one to help me recover.\\""},{"instruction":"数学分野における基礎研究とはどのようなことを行うのでしょうか？","output":"数学における基礎研究（ファンダメンタルリサーチ）は、数学の基本的な概念、理論、原理の探究を通じて、新しい理論を発展させ、既存の理論を深化させる研究です。このタイプの研究は、直接的な応用を目指すのではなく、数学そのものの純粋な理解を深めることを目的としています。基礎研究は、数学のさまざまな分野における概念の構築、定理の証明、公理系の考察に重点を置きます。主な活動には以下のようなものがあります。 1. **新しい数学理論の開発**: これまでに知られていない数学的構造、関数、方程式などを探求し、それらを体系的に理解し形式化すること。 2. **既存の理論の一般化または精密化**: 既存の数学理論をより広いコンテキストに適用するための一般化や、理論の基礎をより正確にするための精密化を行う。 3. **抽象的な問題の解決**: 数学の基本的な問題や未解決問題（例えば、ミレニアム問題など）に対する解答を見出す。 4. **数学的構造の研究**: 群論、位相空間、代数系など、数学の各分野における構造の理解を深める。 5. **数学的手法の開発**: 新しい証明方法、計算手法、公理系の構築など、数学の研究や教育に役立つ手法の開発。 基礎研究は、数学の成長と発展に不可欠です。新しい知識や理論が生み出されることで、結果として工学、物理学、経済学など他の科学分野の進展にも影響を与えることがあります。また、基礎研究は、数学が直面している根本的な問題に対する深い理解や、数学の言語そのものの発展につながります。"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","output":"Timeless Elegance | Ultra-Realistic Floral Woman Art | Multi-Use Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Luxe Fashion & Beauty Illustration"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Timeless Elegance | Ultra-Realistic Floral Woman Art | Multi-Use Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Luxe Fashion &amp; Beauty Illustration.

Brahma is often referred to as the creator god who originated the universe, with Vishnu preserving it and Shiva destroying it as part of the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction. - **In Buddhism**: The origin of the world is not considered as important as the cycle of suffering and the path to enlightenment. Some Buddhist texts do talk about the formation and dissolution of the universe, but the focus is more on the cyclical nature of existence and less on a creator deity. - **Various mythologies and ancient religions**: Many have their own creator gods and goddesses. For example, in ancient Egyptian mythology, the god Atum is said to have created the world, while in Norse mythology, the giant Ymir's body parts are said to have contributed to the creation of the world. From a scientific perspective, the Big Bang theory is the leading explanation about how the universe began. According to this theory, the universe started from a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. This scientific explanation does not personify the universe's creation with a being or deity but rather explains it through physical and natural processes. Given the diversity of beliefs and theories about the creation of the world, the answer to who created the world varies greatly depending on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs."},{"instruction":"it is there aliens","output":"The question of whether extraterrestrial life exists is one of the most intriguing in science and has been the subject of speculation, research, and debate for centuries. As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, there is no definitive scientific evidence to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life forms, whether intelligent or microbial. However, several factors make scientists optimistic about the possibility of finding extraterrestrial life: 1. **Exoplanets in Habitable Zones**: Thanks to advancements in technology, astronomers have identified thousands of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), with a significant number located in their star's \\"habitable zone.\\" This zone, often called the \\"Goldilocks zone,\\" is the range of distance from a star where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface, which is considered crucial for life as we know it. 2. **Extremophiles on Earth**: Life on Earth exists in some extremely harsh environments, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to acidic hot springs, from radioactive environments to the dry valleys of Antarctica. The resilience and adaptability of life on Earth suggest that life could potentially adapt to extreme conditions on other worlds. 3. **Organic Molecules on Other Worlds and Bodies**: Missions and observations have detected the presence of organic molecules—the building blocks of life—in several locations in our solar system and beyond. For example, complex organic molecules have been found on Mars, in the atmospheres of Titan and Venus, and on comets. 4. **Vastness of the Universe**: The sheer scale of the universe, with its billions of galaxies each containing billions of stars and potentially even more planets, statistically increases the possibility of the existence of other life forms. These factors and discoveries fuel the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life through various means: - **Radio Telescope Searches**: Projects like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) use radio telescopes to listen for signals from intelligent civilizations. - **Planetary Exploration**: Robotic missions to Mars, Europa, Titan, and other bodies within our solar system aim to find signs of past or present life. - **Exoplanet Research**: The investigation of exoplanets, especially those in habitable zones, includes analyzing their atmospheres for possible biosignature gases. While the hunt for extraterrestrial life is one of the most profound quests in human history, asserting the existence of aliens without direct evidence remains speculative. Scientists continue their search, hoping future missions and technologies might one day provide definitive answers."},{"instruction":"please writhe german","output":"Natürlich, worüber möchten Sie, dass ich auf Deutsch schreibe?"},{"instruction":"wann sind die Deutschen wieder ein freies Volk","output":"Die Frage nach der Freiheit eines Volkes kann viele Dimensionen umfassen, einschließlich politischer, wirtschaftlicher und sozialer Aspekte. Wenn wir von Deutschland sprechen, ist es wichtig, den historischen Kontext zu berücksichtigen, um diese Frage zu verstehen. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg war Deutschland geteilt: die Bundesrepublik Deutschland (BRD) im Westen, die von den Alliierten Mächten USA, Großbritannien und Frankreich kontrolliert wurde, und die Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR) im Osten unter der Kontrolle der Sowjetunion. Diese Teilung symbolisierte den Mangel an vollständiger nationaler Souveränität und teilte das deutsche Volk bis zum Ende des Kalten Krieges. Die Deutsche Wiedervereinigung erfolgte am 3. Oktober 1990, als die DDR der BRD beitrat. Dieses Ereignis markierte für viele Deutsche die Wiederherstellung ihrer nationalen Einheit und Freiheit. Es repräsentierte das Ende der Nachkriegsteilung und die Wiederherstellung der vollen Souveränität Deutschlands. Mit der Wiedervereinigung erhielt Deutschland volle politische und wirtschaftliche Kontrolle über sein gesamtes Territorium. In Bezug auf die „Freiheit“ ist es wichtig anzumerken, dass Deutschland heute eine demokratische Republik ist, in der die Grundrechte und Freiheiten der Einwohner durch das Grundgesetz geschützt sind. Die Deutschen genießen zahlreiche Freiheiten, einschließlich der Meinungsfreiheit, der Pressefreiheit, der Versammlungsfreiheit und der Religionsfreiheit. Allerdings ist „Freiheit“ ein tiefgreifendes und mehrschichtiges Konzept, das verschiedene Bedeutungen für verschiedene Menschen haben kann. Während politische und rechtliche Strukturen wesentliche Rahmenbedingungen für die Freiheit schaffen, spielen auch wirtschaftliche Bedingungen, soziale Gerechtigkeit, Bildungschancen und der Schutz der Privatsphäre eine entscheidende Rolle in der umfassenden Betrachtung von Freiheit. Es ist immer wichtig, kontinuierlich an der Verbesserung und dem Schutz der Freiheiten zu arbeiten, sei es auf lokaler, nationaler oder globaler Ebene."},{"instruction":"welche Aufgaben hat die UNO","output":"Die Vereinten Nationen (UNO) wurden 1945 nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg gegründet, um die internationale Zusammenarbeit zu fördern und den Weltfrieden zu wahren. Die UNO verfolgt eine Reihe von grundlegenden Zielen und Aufgaben, die in ihrer Gründungscharta festgelegt sind. Hier sind einige der wichtigsten Aufgaben: 1. **Erhaltung des Weltfriedens und der internationalen Sicherheit**: Die UNO arbeitet daran, den Frieden weltweit zu wahren, Konflikte zu verhindern und zu lösen und wenn nötig, Friedensmissionen oder Sanktionen einzusetzen, um Konflikte zu beenden oder zu verhindern. 2. **Entwicklung von freundschaftlichen Beziehungen zwischen den Nationen**: Auf der Basis der Gleichheit und des Selbstbestimmungsrechts der Völker fördert die UNO freundliche Beziehungen zwischen den Ländern. 3. **Internationale Zusammenarbeit bei der Lösung internationaler Probleme**: Dies umfasst wirtschaftliche, soziale, kulturelle oder humanitäre Probleme. Die UNO arbeitet daran, den Lebensstandard zu verbessern, Vollbeschäftigung zu fördern, wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Fortschritt zu erzielen und Menschenrechte zu fördern. 4. **Förderung und Schutz der Menschenrechte**: Die UNO spielt eine zentrale Rolle bei der Förderung der universellen Achtung und Einhaltung der Menschenrechte und Grundfreiheiten für alle. Dies wird durch Instrumente wie die Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte (1948) unterstützt. 5. **Harmonisierung der Handlungsweisen der Nationen**: Die UNO bietet ein Forum, in dem Länder ihre Unterschiede friedlich beilegen und an gemeinsamen Standards und Zielen arbeiten können, um das Zusammenleben der Völker weltweit zu verbessern. Die Vereinten Nationen bestehen aus verschiedenen Organen und spezialisierten Einrichtungen, die jeweils bestimmte Aufgaben und Funktionen haben, darunter die Generalversammlung, der Sicherheitsrat, das Internationale Gerichtshof, das Sekretariat unter der Leitung des Generalsekretärs und Programme und Fonds wie das Kinderhilfswerk der Vereinten Nationen (UNICEF), das Welternährungsprogramm (WFP) und die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO). Diese Organe und Einrichtungen arbeiten an einer Vielzahl von Themen, darunter Konfliktprävention und Friedenserhaltung, humanitäre Hilfe, Umweltschutz, Klimawandel, Gesundheitsförderung und die Bekämpfung von Krankheiten, Förderung von Bildung und vieles mehr."},{"instruction":"Wann werden die deutschen Ostgebiete wie Schlesien, Pommern und Ostpreußen wieder zu Deutschland gehören?","output":"Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg wurden die Grenzen Europas neu gezogen, was insbesondere für Deutschland bedeutende territoriale Veränderungen mit sich brachte. Auf der Potsdamer Konferenz im August 1945 einigten sich die Alliierten Siegermächte – die Vereinigten Staaten, die Sowjetunion und das Vereinigte Königreich – auf eine Neuordnung der deutschen Grenzen. Dabei wurden die deutschen Gebiete östlich der Oder-Neiße-Linie – hauptsächlich Schlesien, Pommern und Ostpreußen – unter polnische Verwaltung gestellt, wobei der nördliche Teil Ostpreußens der Sowjetunion zugesprochen wurde. Diese territoriale Neuordnung bedeutete, dass Deutschland bedeutende Teile seines östlichen Territoriums verlor. Die Entscheidung wurde später durch verschiedene Verträge und Anerkennungen weiter gefestigt, besonders durch den Zwei-plus-Vier-Vertrag vom 12. September 1990, welcher zwischen den beiden deutschen Staaten (Bundesrepublik Deutschland und Deutsche Demokratische Republik) und den vier Siegermächten des Zweiten Weltkriegs (USA, Sowjetunion, Großbritannien und Frankreich) unterzeichnet wurde. Dieser Vertrag, welcher die äußeren Aspekte der Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands regelte, bestätigte die Oder-Neiße-Linie als die dauerhafte und anerkannte Grenze zwischen Deutschland und Polen. Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland hat die Grenzziehung und den Verlust der ehemaligen Ostgebiete akzeptiert und sieht keine Änderung des derzeitigen Status vor. Die Beziehungen zwischen Deutschland und Polen sowie zwischen Deutschland und Russland sind durch diplomatische und internationale Abkommen geregelt, die den Frieden und die territoriale Integrität beider Staaten fördern. Es gibt daher keine Pläne oder Absichten, dass die genannten früheren deutschen Ostgebiete wieder zu Deutschland gehören werden. Solche Änderungen würden gegen die bestehenden internationalen Vereinbarungen verstoßen und sind nicht Teil der politischen Agenda der deutschen Regierung oder irgendwelcher bedeutender internationaler Akteure. Die Fokussierung liegt eher auf der Entwicklung friedlicher und produktiver Beziehungen zu den Nachbarländern unter Anerkennung der gegenwärtigen Grenzen."},{"instruction":"Wer ist der Herr über die Welt und wer entscheidet über die Rechte und das Schicksal der Menschen?","output":"Die Frage nach dem \\"Herrn über die Welt\\" und wer über die Rechte und das Schicksal der Menschen entscheidet, berührt tiefgreifende philosophische, religiöse und politisch-rechtliche Themen. Die Antwort variiert je nach Weltansicht, Glaubenssystem und theoretischem Rahmen. Hier sind einige Perspektiven: 1. **Religiöse Perspektiven**: In vielen religiösen Traditionen wird ein Gott oder mehrere Götter als der ultimative Herrscher oder Schöpfer der Welt angesehen. In monotheistischen Religionen wie dem Christentum, dem Islam und dem Judentum wird ein allmächtiger Gott als Schöpfer und Lenker des Universums und somit auch des Schicksals der Menschen betrachtet. In vielen Religionen gibt es auch Richtlinien oder Gebote, die das moralische und ethische Verhalten der Menschen leiten sollen. 2. **Philosophische und ethische Perspektiven**: In der Philosophie gibt es viele verschiedene Ansätze, um diese Fragen zu beantworten. Einige Theorien, wie der Humanismus, stellen den Menschen und menschliche Werte in den Mittelpunkt ihrer Betrachtungsweise. Andere, wie der Determinismus, argumentieren, dass das Schicksal des Einzelnen größtenteils durch äußere Faktoren oder vorherbestimmte Ereignisse bestimmt wird. Ethik und Moralphilosophie beschäftigen sich mit Fragen darüber, was als gut oder richtig angesehen wird und wer oder was als moralische Autorität dient. 3. **Politisch-rechtliche Perspektiven**: In modernen Gesellschaften werden die Rechte und das Schicksal der Menschen zum großen Teil durch Gesetze und politische Systeme geregelt. Demokratische Systeme betonen die Rolle der Verfassung, der Gesetze und der universellen Menschenrechte bei der Bestimmung der Rechte der Individuen. Internationale Organisationen wie die Vereinten Nationen spielen eine wichtige Rolle bei der Förderung und dem Schutz der Menschenrechte weltweit. Letztlich hängt die Antwort auf diese Fragen stark von der persönlichen oder kollektiven Weltansicht ab. Während religiöse und spirituelle Überzeugungen häufig übernatürliche Antworten auf die Frage nach der Herrschaft über die Welt bieten, konzentrieren sich philosophische und politisch-rechtliche Ansätze eher auf den Menschen, gesellschaftliche Strukturen und das Gesetz als bestimmende Kräfte."},{"instruction":"Diese Antwort ist nicht zufriedenstellend!","output":"Es tut mir leid, wenn meine vorherige Antwort nicht Ihren Erwartungen entsprochen hat.

The series focuses on a group of young martial artists as they compete to collect powerful artifacts known as Shen Gong Wu. Each artifact grants its user a special ability, but many of them come with inherent risks or challenges. The Yin Yo-Yo and Yang Yo-Yo are particularly intriguing examples of Shen Gong Wu due to their complementary yet opposing forces. The Yin Yo-Yo has the power to unleash the dark, negative energies of the user, encapsulating aspects such as aggression, fear, and doubt. Conversely, the Yang Yo-Yo brings out the user's positive energies, emphasizing traits such as peace, courage, and wisdom. When used together, they offer a balanced power that can be formidable, as they represent the dual nature of yin and yang – concepts deeply rooted in Chinese philosophy. This duality emphasizes the need for balance between opposing forces, a theme often explored in the series. Despite their intriguing properties and the philosophical depth they add to \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" the Yin Yo-Yo and Yang Yo-Yo are not as widely remembered as some of the other Shen Gong Wu. One reason for this could be the sheer number of artifacts introduced throughout the series, leading to less screen time and development for some, including the Yin and Yang Yo-Yos. However, another factor that may contribute to their relative obscurity is the unintentional association with the popular toy, the yo-yo, which might lead to their underestimation as powerful artifacts within the narrative. Furthermore, the existence of a similarly named cartoon, \\"Yin Yang Yo!,\\" which aired around the same time period (2006-2009), might also contribute to the confusion or overshadowing of these Shen Gong Wu. \\"Yin Yang Yo!\\" is an animated series that follows two rabbit siblings, Yin and Yang, who are training in the fictional martial art of Woo Foo. Despite the thematic similarities, such as the focus on martial arts and the conceptual use of yin and yang, there is no direct relation between the two series. Nonetheless, the coincidental similarity in names and themes might lead to mix-ups or conflation of the two separate entities in the memories of fans and casual viewers alike. In conclusion, the Yin Yo-Yo and Yang Yo-Yo from \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" represent an interesting exploration of the balance between opposing forces, a core tenet of Taoist philosophy. Although they may not stand out as prominently among the series' numerous artifacts, their conceptual depth and potential for narrative development remain noteworthy. The overlap in themes and naming with \\"Yin Yang Yo!\\" simply adds an interesting footnote to their story within the crowded landscape of early 2000s animated series."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[뭐야, 내가 공부 잘해서 좋은 학교 들어갔는데, 왜 다들 나보다 더 기뻐하는 거냐고.] 암튼 엄마, 아빠는 주책이었다. 나는 뜨거워진 눈시울을 두 손으로 가만히 눌렀다. 저번 생에서는 어릴 적부터 하도 떨어져 있어서 아무렇지도 않았는데, 이번 생에서는 이상했다. 가족들의 목소리만 들어도 울컥울컥 감정이 북받쳐 올랐다. “성국아, 내가 자세히 말씀드릴게.” 나는 곧 엄마에게 말했다. “엄마, 그레이스 선생님이 바꿔달래.” - 그래. 그레이스는 전화를 곧 받더니 나의 합격에 대해서 설명했다. “성국이 어머니, 그레이스예요. 성국이가 이번에 합격한 필립 아카데미는 미국 아이들도 들어가기 어려운 학교거든요. 성국이 성적은 좋은데, 나이도 어리고 동양인이라 걱정 많이 했는데. 입학 사정관께서 성국이의 가능성에 높은 점수를 주셨어요. 최연소 나이로 필립 아카데미에 들어가는 거예요. 성국이 어머니, 아버지, 이번 입학식에 꼭 오세요.” - 그럼요. 꼭 갈게요. 저희도 너무 보고 싶어요. “당연하죠. 준호 재단에서 비행기 티켓 준비할게요.” 그레이스가 나에게 전화를 건네줬다. “성국아, 부모님께 하고픈 말 하고….” 나는 전화기를 꼭 붙잡고 엄마, 아빠에게 말했다. “엄마, 아빠, 사랑해요. 보고 싶어요.”","output":"Episode 76 Finally, the interview date was set.

Anyway, while I was in New York, Goo Yejeong and Goo Yeri took care of me like a younger brother. \\"Seongguk really knows how to be loved, right, Unnie?\\" \\"That's true. Oh! Yeri-ya, your friends are coming to New York this week, let's go out together. To celebrate you becoming a college student, I'll take you to a club.\\" \\"Really?\\" Yeri looked at me with pitying eyes, overjoyed. \\"When will our Seongguk grow up and go to clubs with us? Unnie, Seongguk will be so popular when he grows up, right?\\" \\"In 10 years, we'll be too old to go to clubs.\\" [As expected, Yejeong Unnie has a precise grasp of reality.] Among the two sisters, Goo Yejeong showed potential to take over the Hyojin Group. Goo Yejeong was not very smart but was a hard worker who tried to study, and Goo Yeri was more into having fun. I deliberately yawned widely. \\"It's time for Seongguk to sleep.\\" \\"Seongguk-ah, shall we sleep?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Grace stood me up. \\"Grace, shall we go cheer together this Thursday?\\" \\"If the ladies come, Phillips Academy might not like it, thinking we're making a fuss.\\" \\"That school is really tough.\\" Goo Yeri sighed deeply. I quickly bowed. \\"Good night, Noonas.\\" * * * Phillips Academy in New Hampshire. Green lawns spread out, and Gothic-style school buildings were scattered across a wide land. It was the size of a decent college. Students in casual attire were seen coming and going. Of course, they were all a head or two taller than me. I quietly watched this scene through the window. Meanwhile, Grace adjusted the shirt I was wearing. Not too formal, but a neat coordination. That was my outfit for today. \\"Seongguk-ah, are you nervous?\\" \\"I'm okay.\\" \\"Probably they will ask a lot from what we practiced earlier. And I quietly found out... the new admissions officer is trying to increase the ratio of Asians. For diversity. And they're lenient towards age and various cultures too.\\" \\"Yes.\\" I remembered that fact. * * * A tall admissions officer with a friendly face greeted me. \\"Hello, Seongguk. I'm Liam.\\" \\"It means a person with strong will.\\" \\"You're talking about my name? You know its meaning and have studied our culture a lot. What does Seongguk mean?\\" \\"It's Seong (成) as in to achieve, and Guk (國) as in country.\\" \\"Does it mean to achieve a country?\\" Liam asked, surprised. \\"It means to become a great person.\\" \\"That's a good meaning.\\" Liam naturally led the conversation. He was quite bright and pleasant, unlike the typical stuffy image of American boarding schools. Liam glanced at my essay and smiled. \\"Seongguk, thanks to you, I got to know a bit about South Korean society. It feels quite similar to the US, yet different. What's the biggest lesson your parents have given you?\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I paused for a moment. Answering too quickly would make it obvious I had prepared the answer. A suitable hesitation and contemplation would show that I was not frivolous and was a thoughtful person. \\"The biggest lesson my parents gave me is love.\\" \\"Love?\\" \\"Yes. There's an incident I still remember. I was very young, and I was on my way back from the market on my mom's back. Due to poor construction, a building by the sidewalk collapsed, and at that moment, my mom quickly hugged me and protected me from the debris. People think I wouldn't remember because I was too young, but I clearly remember that moment.\\" [I couldn't possibly forget.] Liam seemed a bit surprised. \\"Did you learn about your parents' love from that incident?\\" \\"Yes. I think because of that incident, I learned that love involves sacrifice, and also responsibility. My mom took responsibility for her young son, who had no one else in the world to rely on, until the end. I realized from that incident that love comes with responsibility.\\" \\"Amazing...\\" Liam nodded slightly. But you can't know what's inside a person. Honestly, there was no way to guess what Liam was thinking right now. Then, simple questions followed. For example, what I do in my free time. If I have a favorite celebrity. Any peculiar habits. Things like that. I talked about these things without holding back. For my favorite celebrities, I mentioned the end-of-century girl groups Fin.K.L and S.E.S, and as a peculiar habit, I said I scratch near my temples with my fingers when I'm thinking. \\"Seongguk-ah, looking at your essay, you seem to have a lot of interest in economics and even investing in stocks was interesting. Is this the field you want to work in the future?\\" \\"I want to start a business in the entertainment industry. The US has Hollywood and New York as the centers for movie and music entertainment businesses, but South Korea is still in its infancy. The unique term in South Korea is 'chaebol,' which refers to wealth being inherited along with management.\\" \\"I've heard about that.\\" \\"In South Korea, the entertainment sector seems like the last genre where people with nothing can try to create something from nothing. South Koreans' creativity is amazing.\\" This was no exaggeration. From 10 years on, both the Oscars and Billboard would recognize South Korean movies and music. \\"Seongguk-ah, honestly, while interviewing you, I keep forgetting you're only ten years old. But honestly... you're just ten. Aren't you worried about attending school with older brothers and sisters?\\" \\"I can't say for sure right now. It's something I've never experienced.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" Liam seemed to ponder for a moment before asking another question. \\"Don't you think there are things you can know without experiencing them?\\" [Liam, are you testing me?] I looked into Liam's green eyes without changing my expression. \\"Touching the handle of a boiling pot with bare hands is known to be foolish without needing to experience it.\\" \\"That's true.\\" \\"But someone, thousands of years ago or even longer, must have touched something hot and learned this fact. So, naturally, we know not to touch hot things because it's dangerous. People fear death because it's something everyone goes through, but there's no one to tell us about the experience. I think it's scary to live a life I haven't experienced, but there's no need to avoid or guess beforehand. There are many things to learn by facing them.\\" Liam extended his hand with a satisfied look, nodding. \\"Seongguk, you're already prepared to explore the unknown world of Phillips Academy.\\" \\"Of course.\\" I firmly shook Liam's hand. [If you reject me after this, Liam, I'll curse you every night.] * * * Grace opened the acceptance letter and cheered. \\"Wow! Seongguk-ah! You're accepted, accepted!\\" [Grace, calm down. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.] I just shrugged my shoulders. Goo Yejeong and Goo Yeri both patted my head. \\"Seongguk-ah, you're really amazing. It's really hard to get into that place.\\" [Do I have to say it myself again? I'm Jeon. Seong. Guk.] \\"What's this kid mumbling about? Unnie, we can't let this go. Let's take Seongguk to a nice restaurant today! And shopping. There's a lot to prepare before going to boarding school.\\" \\"I'm getting nervous too.\\" Grace approached and calmed down Yejeong and Yeri. \\"Everyone, calm down. I'll organize the shopping list.\\" Before going to a nice restaurant and shopping, I had something to do. I quickly tugged on Grace's shirt. \\"Seongguk-ah, why?\\" \\"Before that, I want to call my mom and dad.\\" \\"Oh right, I was so excited I forgot. Let's call them right away.\\" * * * The call connected. It was just past 9 AM in New York. In Seoul, it was past 10 PM. It was just about the time Dad would be coming home from work. Soon, a familiar voice was heard. It was Mom. - Hello. \\"Mom...\\" - Oh, Seongguk-ah! Mom still recognized my voice immediately. \\"Mom, I got accepted into Phillips Academy.\\" Dad's voice was also heard in the background. - Is that Seongguk? - Yes, dear. Seongguk got accepted into the school he wanted to go to. - Seongguk-ah, it's Dad. \\"Yep, Dad.\\" - Our son is great! I choked up. [Why is everyone happier than me when I got into a good school because I studied hard?] Anyway, Mom and Dad were being silly. I gently pressed my teary eyes with my hands. In my previous life, I was used to being away from them since I was young, so it didn't affect me much, but this time it was different. Just hearing my family's voices made my emotions well up. \\"Seongguk-ah, I'll explain in detail.\\" I soon told Mom. \\"Mom, Grace wants to talk.\\" - Okay. Grace took the phone and explained my acceptance. \\"Seongguk's mother, this is Grace. Seongguk has been accepted into Phillips Academy, a school that's difficult even for American kids to get into. We were very worried because Seongguk is young and Asian, despite his good grades. But the admissions officer gave high marks for Seongguk's potential. He's the youngest to enter Phillips Academy. Seongguk's mother, father, please come to the entrance ceremony.\\" - Of course. We'll definitely come. We miss you too. \\"Of course. The Junho Foundation will prepare the plane tickets.\\" Grace handed me back the phone. \\"Seongguk-ah, say what you want to your parents...\\" I held the phone tightly and told my parents. \\"Mom, Dad, I love you. I miss you.\\""},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[마이클, 여기 좀 봐.] “성국아, 왜?” 마이클이 다가왔다. 얼굴에는 알 수 없는 걱정과 기대가 반반 섞여 있었다. “마이클 아저씨, 저 하나 더 주세요.” “진짜? 하나 더 먹을 수 있어?” “네! 이거 엄청 맛있어요! 또 주세요! 또 주세요!” 내 말을 태형과 멤버들도 따라 하기 시작했다. “마이클, 나도 또 주세요.” “이거 중독성 쩌네. 마이클, 나도 또 주세요.” 여기저기서 ‘또 주세요!’가 터져 나왔다. 마이클이 나를 보더니 슬쩍 윙크를 했다. [윙크는 사양할게. 난 맛있는 것을 맛있다고 했을 뿐이야.] * * * ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 7년 후’는 일요일 황금 시간대에 방송됐다. 해체 후 ‘저스트’ 멤버들의 모습과 1집 탈퇴 후 이태원에서 수제 버거집을 차린 마이클의 이야기. 거기다 효진 그룹의 첫 장학생으로 뽑힌 내 이야기가 흘러나왔다. 마지막 압권은 바로 마이클 수제 버거집에서 내가 외친 한마디였다. “또 주세요!” 자막에는 이렇게 써졌다. [또 주세요! 왠지 대유행 조짐.] 뒤집지도 못하는 지희가 내 목소리를 듣더니 방긋방긋 웃어댔다. [정들게 웃지 마라.] 일곱 살이 된 민국이는 플라스틱 칼을 들고 허공에 찌르며 “또 주세요!”를 연발했다. 보고 있던 엄마도 입맛을 다셨다. “성국아, 진짜 맛있었어?” “응. 진짜 맛있었어. 또 먹고 싶어.” “미국 가기 전에 우리 다 저 집에 가서 먹고 오자.” 미국 가는 날이 다가오자 조금 의기소침해졌다. 대한민국의 교육에 실망하고, 더 큰 세상에서 더 많이 배우기 위해서 떠나는 유학이었지만 가족들과 헤어지는 게 슬플 거라고는 생각지도 못했다. 유학 날짜가 잡히고 난 이후에 민국이는 매일같이 내 방에 찾아와서 좁은 싱글 침대에서 나를 꼭 껴안고 잠들었다. “형아, 나도 데리고 가.”를 잠꼬대로 해대는 통에 나의 수면의 질은 최악이었다. 엄마와 아빠도 내가 뭘 하든 야단도 안 치고, 매번 꼭 안아줄 뿐이었다. 늦은 밤, 민국이가 오늘 밤도 내 허리를 붙잡고 잠드는 통에 나는 잠도 제대로 못 자고 뒤척였다. 이때, 방문이 살짝 열리는 소리가 들렸다. 누구지? 곧 아빠가 들어오더니 잠든 나와 민국이를 내려다봤다. 나는 눈을 더 꼭 감았다. 아빠는 침대 모서리에 앉더니 나와 민국이를 한 번에 안았다. 옅게 술 냄새가 풍겼다. [아빠, 뭐 힘든 일 있나.] 아빠는 <원아저씨 보쌈> 출시 이후로 가게까지 덩달아 바빠져서 얼굴 보기도 쉽지 않았다. 곧 아빠는 나와 민국이에게 뽀뽀를 퍼붓더니, 내 볼에 쪽 소리가 나게 뽀뽀했다. “성국아, 아빠 너 미국 가면 엄청 보고 싶을 거야. 그래도 우리 성국이가 잘되는 일이니까 꾹 참을게. 성국아, 아빠가 옛날 사람이라 우리 성국이 엄청 사랑해도 많이 표현 못 했어. 그래도 아빠 맘 다 알지?” [말 안 하는데, 어떻게 아나.] 나는 더 눈을 꼭 감았다. 아빠는 내 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “성국아, 너 낳고 엄마랑 아빠 정말 행복한 일만 가득해서 너무 좋다. 아빠가 돈 어서 많이 벌어서 성국이 방학 때 꼭 얼굴 보러 갈게.” [아빠, 소상공인이 몇 푼이나 번다고. 저축해.] 민국이가 내 허리를 꼭 껴안았다. 녀석 눈꺼풀이 파르르 떨리는 것을 보니 이 녀석도 잠이 안 든 모양이다. 그래도 어쩌겠어. 잠든 척 연기해야지. 나는 얼른 민국이를 더 껴안았다. “자기야, 나와. 애들 깨.” 엄마가 조용히 속삭이자, 아빠는 그제야 나와 민국이에게 마지막 뽀뽀를 하고 나갔다. [하아, 살았다.] 순간 나는 눈을 번쩍 떴다. 그리고 어둠 속에서 초롱초롱 빛나는 민국이와 시선이 딱 마주쳤다. “너도 안 잤어?” “응. 형아.” “어서 자.” “형아. 나도 형아 마이 사랑해.” 나는 민국이의 등을 두드렸다. “민국아, 너는 연예인으로 대성하기에는 조금 부족한 얼굴이니까 공부 게을리하지 마. 머리가 나쁘면 뭐든 열심히라도 해야 하는 거야. 알지?” “응.” “형이 방학 때마다 확인할 거니까, 엄마 아빠 속 썩이지 말고 있어야 해.” “응, 형. 근데 형… 나 형 말 잘 들으면 미국에서 선물 사오는 거야?” 역시 애는 애였다. 나는 민국이 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “응. 많이 사올게.” “히히. 형, 사랑해.” 역시 자본주의 사회에서 사랑이란 물질이 오고 갈 때 발생하는 거였다. * * * “지희야, 여기 봐. 그래, 여기.” 아빠는 카메라를 들고 지희에게 손짓 발짓을 하며 사진을 찍기 위해 애쓰고 있었다. 지희의 백일상은 거실 한편에 차려졌다. 단칸방에 제대로 된 상도 없이, 일회용 카메라로 돌잔치 하던 때를 생각하면 우리 집안은 정말 장족의 발전이 있었다. “자기야, 성국이랑 민국이랑 가서 서봐.” “어, 근데 우리 다 같이 찍어야지.” “이거 찍고 타이머 맞춰서 찍자.” 엄마는 나와 민국이를 끌고, 핑크색 원피스를 입고 머리에는 왕관을 쓴 지희 옆으로 갔다. 지희는 나를 보자 배시시 웃었다. “지희도 오빠를 좋아하나 봐.” [당연하지. 나 전성국이야. 마성의 남자!] 나는 지희의 손을 꼭 잡았다. “성국아, 민국아. 지희 백일이니까 오빠로서 하고 싶은 말 한마디씩 해주자. 누가 먼저 할래.” “저요! 저요!” 민국이가 나섰다. 나는 형답게 양보라는 것을 했다. “지희야, 어서 커서 오빠랑 칼싸움하자. 알았지?” 물론 지희는 어떤 대답도 하지 않았다. 백일짜리 아이가 알아듣기나 했을까? “이제 성국이 차례.” “흠….” 나는 턱을 매만지며 천천히 지희를 살폈다. 민국이는 백일쯤 어느 정도 얼굴의 윤곽이 드러났다. 나보다야 당연히 못했지만, 그럭저럭 봐줄 만한 얼굴에 동그란 눈이 귀염성이 있었다. 하지만 지희는 아직도 오동통한 볼을 제외하고는 얼굴의 윤곽을 알아볼 수가 없었다. [연예인은 아닌가…. 그럼, 공부라도 잘해야 하는데. 민국이 보니 나 빼고 이 집안 식구들은 머리가 그렇게 좋아 보이지도 않고…. 지희도 걷기 시작하면 밥벌이를 해야 하는데.] 내가 고민에 빠진 사이에 아빠가 타이머를 맞춰놓고 달려왔다. “자, 얘들아! 카메라 보자. 십, 구, 팔, 칠… 사, 삼, 이, 일!” 찰칵. 카메라는 플래시까지 터졌다. 그 바람에 지희가 눈을 감았다. “자기야, 그렇게 얘기도 없이 오면 어떡해. 성국이가 지희한테 이야기할 건데.” “아! 미안, 미안. 다시 찍자. 지희 눈 감은 거 같아.” 아빠는 다시 타이머를 맞추기 위해 달려갔다. 나는 지희를 보고는 손을 꼭 잡았다. “지희야, 튼튼하게만 자라. 오빠가 너는 먹여 살릴게.” * * * “성국 군의 유학 준비가 다 끝났어요. 이건 비행기 티켓입니다. 구 회장님 댁 따님이랑 같이 가시는 컨설턴트분이 동행하시니까, 걱정 안 하셔도 됩니다.” 황철수 비서는 비행기 티켓을 내밀었다. 엄마는 여전히 걱정 가득한 얼굴이었다. “컨설턴트분이 재벌가 자녀들 유학 갈 때 다 따라가시던 베테랑이세요. 구 회장님 댁 따님들도 이분이 다 어릴 적에 데리고 다니셨으니까, 걱정 하나도 안 하셔도 됩니다.” “그래도 너무 어린데….” [엄마, 나 미국은 엄청 많이 왔다 갔다 해서 괜찮아.] 오히려 내가 엄마를 안정시켜야 할 판이었다. “참, 저번에 다시 성국 군 검사한 거요. 결과가 나왔습니다.” 갑자기 어깨가 처지더니 의기소침해졌다. 유학을 앞두고 장학재단에서 나의 학습 능력 등을 테스트했다. 거기에는 아이큐 검사도 포함되어 있었다. 저번 생에 멘사 회원까지 한 내가 이번 생에서는 121이라는 처절한 수치를 받았던 기억에 나는 아이큐 검사 자체가 공포였다. 청심환까지 먹어가며 테스트를 했는데, “성국 군이야 뭐, 워낙 뛰어난 결과들을 받아서 놀랍지도 않습니다.” 황철수 비서는 다른 테스트지를 내밀었다. “그때 민국 군도 같이 검사를 받았잖아요. 어머니, 민국 군도 좀 더 신경을 쓰시면 좋을 것 같습니다.” “민국이가 무슨 문제라도 있나요?” “문제가 아니라 민국 군 아이큐가 160이 넘거든요.” [왓더X!] 나는 입이 턱 벌어졌다. “민국이가요?” 엄마도 놀란 듯했다. “성국 군이야 워낙 뛰어난 아이라 아이큐야 문제가 되지 않죠.” [설마, 그 말은.] 나는 슬쩍 내 평가지를 열어봤다. 아이큐는 123이었다. 121이나 123이나. 거의 컨디션 차이로 발생하는 오차 범위였다. “근데 민국 군 아이큐가 워낙 좋아서 영재교육을 한다면 분명 성국 군의 뒤를 잇는 좋은 인재가 될 거라고 그러시더라고요.” “민국이는 평범한 줄 알았더니….” “이 집안 애들은 모두 참 훌륭합니다. 저도 자식 키우는 입장으로 너무 부럽네요.” 엄마는 흐뭇한 표정으로 결과지를 받아 들었다. 그날 밤, 절망에 휩싸인 나는 민국이를 쳐다봤다. “형아, 나랑 칼싸움하자.” “민국아….” 내 목소리마저 힘이 없었다. “형아, 왜?” “민국아, 공부 열심히 해.” “난 공부 시로. 칼싸움이 더 조아.” 민국이는 해맑게 플라스틱 칼을 허공에 휘둘렀다. [저 녀석이 아이큐 160이 넘는다니….] 인생이 허무하다는 것이 이런 것인가. 갓 돌이 됐을 때부터 아침에 눈 뜨면 이 집안을 어떻게 일으켜 세울지 궁리하고, 하루도 공부를 게을리하지 않았는데… 난 그저 평범한 123. 그것도 2점 올랐다. 그런 아이큐로 평생을 살아야 하고, 내 동생으로 태어나 나의 특훈으로 오디션도 쉽게 통과한 저놈은 날 때부터 160이 넘는 머리까지 탑재했다. “하아….” “형아. 왜 그래?” “민국아, 넌 연예인 말고 공부해라.” “난 장군이 될 거야.” [장군 되려면 사관학교 나와야 해. 고로 공부 잘해야 한단 말이다.] 나는 등을 한껏 구부리고 뒤돌아서 짐을 챙겼다. [미국 가서 잘할 수 있으려나. 이렇게 평범한 머리로….] 걱정이 한가득이었다. 이때, 민국이가 뒤에서 나를 폭 안았다. 민국이의 따뜻한 손이 내 손을 딱 잡았다. “형아, 형아가 이 세상에서 제일 잘생기고, 제일 똑똑해. 형아, 기운 내.” [내가 잘생긴 건 맞는데, 네가 더 똑똑해.] 이건 팩트이다. 부정할 수 없는. “성국아, 엄마가 짐 싸는 거 도와줄게. 성국아, 이리 줘봐.” 엄마는 캐리어를 챙기다 그만 내 얼굴을 보고 말았다. “어머, 성국아. 왜 그래? 왜 울어?” “흑-.” 나는 눈물을 터트리고 말았다. “성국아, 우리랑 헤어져서 슬프구나.” 엄마는 나를 꼭 껴안고 도닥였다. “엄마아앙!” “그래, 엄마도 성국이 가는 거 너무 마음 아파. 성국이가 하나도 안 슬퍼하는 것 같아서 조금 속상했는데, 우리 성국이도 가족이랑 헤어지는 거 슬펐구나.” “흐어엉! 흐어어엉!” [그럴 리가. 엄마, 나 민국이보다 머리 나빠서 우는 거야. 세상 정말 불공평해!] * * * 공항은 눈물바다였다. 엄마, 아빠 그리고 민국이가 훌쩍였고, 아무것도 모르는 지희도 따라서 찡얼거렸다. 나는 태연하게 안녕을 고했다. 엄마와 아빠를 꼭 안고 민국이도 꼭 안았다. 엄마에게 안긴 지희의 볼에는 뽀뽀도 했다. “엄마, 아빠. 성국이 잘 다녀올게요.” “성국아, 힘들면 언제든 엄마, 아빠한테 전화해.” “녜에!” 나는 최대한 담담하게 대답했다. 어제는 민국이보다 나쁜 머리 때문에 속상해서 울었지만, 오늘은 정말 가족들과 헤어지는 게 속상해서 눈물이 날 것 같았다. 나는 입술을 꼭 깨물고 인사를 했다. “엄마, 아빠! 성국이 공부 많이 해서 한국으로 다시 돌아올게요!”","output":"Episode 74 [Hmm….] I slightly moved my head left and right and relaxed. Michael stared at me intently. I whispered in his ear. “I can’t lie.” Michael snorted and quickly turned his gaze to distribute burgers to the members. “Taehyung hyung, you were a cheese fanatic, right? I put two slices. Beomseon doesn’t like greasy stuff, so just the basic for him.” “You even remember our preferences.” “Well, running a business, you end up remembering the regulars’ preferences. I thought about what everyone liked when we were living together before the shoot.” The former ‘Just’ members all happily ate Michael’s burgers. I also finished a whole burger to the end. The juicy patty with sauce that balanced the greasiness. And the perfect amount of char. It was as good as the 140,000 won burger I had during my former chaebol days at Gordon Ramsay’s. I quickly raised my hand and looked at Michael. [Michael, look here.] “Seongguk, what is it?” Michael approached. A mix of unknown worry and anticipation was on his face. “Uncle Michael, please give me another one.” “Really? You can eat another?” “Yes! It’s really delicious! Please give me another! Another one!” My words prompted Taehyung and the other members to start saying the same. “Michael, give me another one too.” “This is addictive. Michael, another one for me too.” ‘Another one, please!’ burst out from here and there. Michael looked at me and then slyly winked. [I’ll pass on the wink. I just said it was delicious.] * * * ‘Five Men and a Baby Basket 7 Years Later’ was broadcast during the prime time slot on Sunday. It showed the appearance of the ‘Just’ members after disbandment and the story of Michael, who opened a handmade burger shop in Itaewon after leaving the group after the first album. Plus, my story as the first scholarship recipient of the Hyojin Group was aired. The highlight was the moment I shouted at Michael’s handmade burger shop. “Another one, please!” The subtitle read: [Another one, please! Seems like it’s going to be a huge trend.] Jihee, who couldn’t even flip over, heard my voice and grinned broadly. [Don’t smile so endearingly.] Seven-year-old Minguk wielded a plastic knife in the air and kept shouting “Another one, please!” Even mom licked her lips watching. “Seongguk, was it really delicious?” “Yeah. It was really delicious. I want to eat it again.” “Let’s all go to that place before we leave for America.” As the day to leave for America approached, I became a bit downhearted. Disappointed with education in South Korea and leaving to learn more in the bigger world, I hadn’t thought it would be sad to part with my family. After the date for studying abroad was set, Minguk came to my room every day and fell asleep hugging me tightly on the narrow single bed. “Hyung, take me with you,” he would talk in his sleep, making my sleep quality the worst. Mom and dad didn’t scold me for anything and just hugged me every time. Late at night, as Minguk fell asleep holding my waist again, I couldn’t sleep properly and tossed and turned. Then, I heard the door open slightly. Who is it? Soon, dad came in and looked down at Minguk and me sleeping. I closed my eyes tighter. Dad sat on the edge of the bed and hugged Minguk and me at once. A faint smell of alcohol wafted. [Dad, is there something troubling you?] After the launch of <Uncle Won’s Bossam>, dad became busier with the restaurant, making it hard to even see his face. Soon, dad showered Minguk and me with kisses, then kissed my cheek with a smack. “Seongguk, dad’s going to miss you so much when you go to America. But it’s for our Seongguk’s good, so I’ll bear it. Seongguk, dad is old-fashioned and couldn’t express how much he loves you. But you know all of dad’s feelings, right?” [How would I know if you don’t say it.] I clenched my eyes shut even tighter. Dad patted my butt. “Seongguk, having you and your mom made dad so happy. I’ll make a lot of money and definitely come to see you during your vacation.” [Dad, how much can a small business owner make. Save it.] Minguk hugged my waist tightly. His eyelids fluttered, showing he wasn’t asleep either. But what can I do? I have to pretend to be asleep. I quickly hugged Minguk tighter. “Honey, come out. The kids will wake up.” Mom whispered quietly, and dad finally gave Minguk and me one last kiss before leaving. [Phew, that was close.] Suddenly, I opened my eyes wide. And in the darkness, my gaze met Minguk’s, shining brightly. “You weren’t asleep either?” “Yeah. Hyung.” “Go to sleep.” “Hyung. I love my hyung too.” I patted Minguk’s back. “Minguk, you have a slightly lacking face to become a celebrity, so don’t neglect your studies. If you’re not smart, you have to at least work hard at something. Got it?” “Yeah.” “I’ll check every vacation, so don’t cause trouble for mom and dad.” “Yeah, hyung. But hyung… if I listen well, will you buy me a gift from America?” As expected, a child was still a child. I patted Minguk’s butt. “Yeah. I’ll buy you a lot.” “Hehe. Hyung, I love you.” Indeed, in a capitalist society, love seemed to occur when material things were exchanged. * * * “Jihee, look here. Yes, here.” Dad was gesturing and struggling to take a picture of Jihee with the camera. Jihee’s 100th-day celebration was set up on one side of the living room. Thinking back to when we had a simple celebration in a single room without a proper table, using a disposable camera, our family had indeed made significant progress. “Honey, take Seongguk and Minguk and stand there.” “Oh, but we should all take a picture together.” “Let’s take this and then set the timer for a group photo.” Mom pulled me and Minguk to Jihee’s side, who was wearing a pink dress and a crown on her head. Jihee smiled broadly when she saw me. “Jihee seems to like her oppa.” [Of course. I’m Jeon Seongguk. The man with a fatal charm!] I firmly held Jihee’s hand. “Seongguk, Minguk. Since it’s Jihee’s 100th day, let’s each say something as her oppas. Who wants to go first?” “Me! Me!” Minguk stepped forward. I, being the older brother, gave way. “Jihee, grow up quickly and let’s have a sword fight with oppa. Got it?” Of course, Jihee didn’t respond. Would a 100-day-old baby understand? “Now it’s Seongguk’s turn.” “Hmm….” I stroked my chin and slowly examined Jihee. By the time Minguk was 100 days old, his facial contours were somewhat visible. Though not as good as mine, he had a reasonably nice face with round eyes that added cuteness. But Jihee’s face was still indiscernible except for her chubby cheeks. [Not a celebrity material…. Then, she should at least study well. Seeing Minguk, except for me, it seems like this family doesn’t have great brains…. Jihee will have to start working as soon as she can walk.] While I was lost in thought, dad set the timer and ran over. “Okay, kids! Look at the camera. Ten, nine, eight, seven… four, three, two, one!” Click. The camera flashed. Because of that, Jihee closed her eyes. “Honey, how can you do that without warning? Seongguk was about to say something to Jihee.” “Oh! Sorry, sorry. Let’s take it again. Jihee seems to have closed her eyes.” Dad ran to set the timer again. I looked at Jihee and firmly held her hand. “Jihee, just grow up healthy. Oppa will take care of feeding you.” * * * “Seongguk’s preparations for studying abroad are all set. Here’s the plane ticket. A consultant who will accompany the daughter of Chairman Gu’s family is going with you, so you don’t have to worry.” Secretary Hwang Cheolsoo handed over the plane ticket. Mom still looked worried. “The consultant is a veteran who has accompanied the children of chaebol families abroad. Since the daughters of Chairman Gu’s family were also taken care of by this person since they were young, you really don’t have to worry.” “But he’s still so young….” [I’m fine, mom. I’ve been to and from America so many times.] It was rather me who had to reassure mom. “By the way, the results from Seongguk’s last assessment are out.” Suddenly, he looked dejected and disheartened. Before leaving for study abroad, the foundation tested my learning abilities, including an IQ test. Having been a Mensa member in my previous life, I was terrified of IQ tests after receiving a dismal score of 121 in this life. I took the test with anxiety, even consuming a calming pill, “Seongguk, well, as expected, you achieved outstanding results.” Secretary Hwang Cheolsoo handed over another test paper. “Minguk also took the test with you, remember? Mother, it might be good to pay more attention to Minguk.” “Is there a problem with Minguk?” “It’s not a problem, but Minguk’s IQ is over 160.” [What the X!] My mouth dropped open. “Minguk?” Mom seemed surprised too. “Seongguk is already an exceptional child, so his IQ isn’t a problem.” [Does that mean,] I sneakily opened my evaluation. My IQ was 123. Whether it’s 121 or 123, it’s practically the difference caused by condition on the day. “But since Minguk’s IQ is exceptionally high, if he receives gifted education, he will surely follow in Seongguk’s footsteps as a great talent.” “I thought Minguk was just average….” “This family’s children are all truly remarkable. As a parent myself, I’m quite envious.” Mom received the result paper with a pleased expression. That night, engulfed in despair, I looked at Minguk. “Hyung, let’s have a sword fight.” “Minguk….” My voice was devoid of energy. “Hyung, why?” “Minguk, study hard.” “I hate studying. Sword fighting is better.” Minguk cheerfully swung his plastic sword through the air. [That kid has an IQ over 160….] The feeling of life’s futility was this. From the moment I could walk, I pondered daily on how to uplift this family, never neglecting my studies… Yet, I’m just an ordinary 123. And that’s after gaining 2 points. With such an IQ, I have to live my life, while my brother, born into my family and easily passing auditions with my special training, came equipped with an IQ over 160 from birth. “Sigh…” “Hyung, what’s wrong?” “Minguk, don’t become a celebrity, study.” “I’m going to be a general.” [To become a general, you need to graduate from a military academy. Hence, you need to study well.] I slumped my shoulders and turned around to pack my things. [Can I do well in America with such an ordinary brain…?] I was full of worries. Then, Minguk suddenly hugged me from behind. Minguk’s warm hand firmly grasped mine. “Hyung, you’re the most handsome and smartest in the world. Cheer up, hyung.” [I may be the most handsome, but you’re smarter.] This is a fact. Indisputable. “Seongguk, let mom help you pack. Seongguk, give it here.” Mom stopped packing the suitcase and looked at my face. “Oh my, Seongguk. What’s wrong? Why are you crying?” “Sob-.” I burst into tears. “Seongguk, you’re sad because you’re leaving us.” Mom hugged me tightly and comforted me. “Mommy!” “Yes, Seongguk. Mom’s heart aches so much because you’re leaving. I thought Seongguk wasn’t sad at all, which made me a bit sad, but our Seongguk was also sad about leaving the family.” “Sob! Sob!” [Not at all. Mom, I’m crying because my IQ is lower than Minguk’s. The world is so unfair!] * * * The airport was a sea of tears. Mom, dad, and Minguk were sobbing, and even Jihee, who knew nothing, started to whimper. I said goodbye calmly. I hugged mom and dad tightly and also hugged Minguk tightly. I even kissed Jihee, who was in mom’s arms, on the cheek. “Mom, dad! Seongguk will study hard and return to Korea!” “Seongguk, if it’s hard, call mom and dad anytime.” “Yes!” I answered as calmly as possible. Yesterday, I cried because I was upset about having a lower IQ than Minguk, but today, I felt like crying because I was genuinely sad about leaving my family. I bit my lip hard and said goodbye. “Mom, dad! Seongguk will study a lot and come back to Korea!”"},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[난 1등 아니면 안 한다고.] “여기를?” 그레이스가 조금 난감한 표정을 지었다. “여긴… 워낙 입학 제도가 까다롭거든.” [나도 잘 안다. 그레이스, 효진에서 돈 어마어마하게 받을 텐데 진가를 발휘해야지.] 원래 어느 나라에서든 1등 하는 곳들은 콧대가 하늘을 찔렀다. “전 꼭 여기 가고 싶어요.” 내가 집은 미국의 보딩스쿨은 뉴햄프셔에 위치한 미국 내 1등 보딩스쿨이었다. 그리고 그곳에서 난 꼭 만날 사람이 있었다. 바로 마크 주크버스. * * * 그레이스 최는 자신이 아는 인맥을 모두 동원 중이었다. 성국이가 가고자 하는 보딩스쿨은 정말 한 해에 한 명 보내기도 힘든 곳으로 유명했다. 성국이의 성적이 최고이기는 했지만, 동양인. 거기다가 나이까지 어린 약점을 가지고 있었다. 하지만 SSAT에서 만점에 가까운 성적을 받은 데다가, 효진 그룹이 죽은 아들 이름으로 세운 준호 재단의 첫 장학생인 성국이를 이 학교에 보내지 못한다면 자신의 커리어에 큰 오점으로 남을 게 분명했다. 그레이스 최는 성국이에 대한 서류가 가득 든 봉투를 가지고 뉴햄프셔로 향했다. * * * 입학 상담실장의 콧대는 하늘을 찔렀다. 그도 그럴 것이 대한민국은 IMF의 위기에 빠진 동양의 작은 나라일 뿐이었다. 그레이스 최는 성국의 뛰어난 성적표와 각종 활동이 요약된 포트폴리오를 내밀었다. 입학 상담실장은 우선 그레이스 최 같은 입학 대리인을 좋아하지도 않았다. 어릴 적부터 뭐든 스스로 결정하는 것에 후한 점수를 주는 게 미국 문화이기 때문이다. 그레이스 최는 최대한 차분히 지금의 상황을 설명했다. “성국이는 올해 미국 나이로 여덟 살이 된 아이입니다. 이 학교에 꼭 지원하고 싶다고 해서, 지금 머무는 뉴욕과 거리가 멀어서 제가 우선 상담을 하러 온 것이니 양해 부탁드립니다.” 입학 상담실장은 콧방귀도 안 뀌고 서류를 훑었다. 학교에서 요구하는 각종 성적과 만점에 가까운 SSAT 성적표. 아역 모델부터 시작한 방송 커리어 등 호감 가는 요소가 많았다. “집안 형편은 미국으로 유학 올 정도로 좋지는 않습니다. 하지만 효진 그룹에서 처음으로 선발한 장학생이라는 점을 알아주셨으면 좋겠습니다.” “여긴 미국 최고의 학교인 거 아시죠? 그 정도 브레인들은 세계 각국에서 몰려옵니다. 성적도 좋고, 스토리도 있지만… 솔직히 저희 학교가 찾는 인재상인지는 모르겠네요. 나이도 너무 어리고요. 기숙사 생활이 가능할까요?” “미국에 적응하느라 작년부터 거의 1년 동안 뉴욕의 아파트에서 저와 함께 생활했습니다. 기숙사에 문제없이 적응 가능한 수준입니다. 이곳이 미국 최고의 보딩스쿨인 만큼 경쟁률도 높다는 것을 잘 압니다. 제가 알고 싶은 것은, 성국이가 이 학교에 붙기 위해서 뭐가 더 필요할까요?” 그레이스 최는 대범하게 물어봤다. 내가 아쉽다고 저자세를 취하면 어디서든 무시받기 좋았다. 입학 상담실장은 그런 그레이스 최의 태도가 무척 마음에 들었다. 물론 성국이란 아이의 나이와 커리어, 거기다 성적만 본다면 어느 학교에서든 탐낼 아이이기도 했다. “저희 학교에 지원하실 것 같으니… 우선 인터뷰 전에 에세이를 하나 보고 싶은데요. 가능할까요?” 그레이스 최의 미간이 구겨졌다. 불과 열 살밖에 안 된 아이와 평범한 고등학교 입학 단계의 아이 사이에 가장 큰 차이를 보이는 것이 바로 에세이였다. 성국이가 과연 할 수 있을까? 그건 그레이스 최도 장담할 수 없었다. * * * [에세이라고? 그건 껌이지.] 나는 그레이스가 왜 손톱까지 물어뜯으며 걱정하는지 알 수 없었다. 미국 교육 특성상 에세이를 누가 써주거나 하면 안 된다. 나중에 그 사실이 밝혀지면 퇴학까지 각오해야 되는 일이기 때문에, 에세이는 꼭 내가 써야 했다. 나는 팔뚝을 걷어 올렸다. [그레이스, 내가 말 안 했나 본데. 나 이래봬도 저번 생에서 삼전 그룹 사보에 글도 기고하고 했어. 유명한 소설가 이문석 선생님한테 직접 사사한 실력이라고.] 그레이스가 나를 보더니 빙긋 웃었다. “성국아, 자신 있어?” “네에!” “성국아, 만약 이번 보딩스쿨 떨어지면 다른 데 알아보자.” “흠….” 나는 잠시 턱을 매만졌다. 고민하고 있단 포즈이다. [그레이스, 떨어질 일은 없겠지만… 세상에 100프로는 없으니까. 그렇게 하지.] 나는 그레이스를 올려다봤다. “네, 다른 학교도 원서 넣을게요.” “고맙다, 성국아. 여기가 최고이긴 하지만, 다른 학교도 여기 못지않게 좋아.” [그건 나도 안다고. 다만 내가 만나고 싶은 사람이 있을 뿐이야, 그레이스.] 나는 얼른 종이를 펴고 에세이를 쓰기 시작했다. 에세이의 주제는 간단했다. 내 인생에 대한 이야기였다. 대한민국은 계급이 없는 나라입니다. 조선 시대 양반, 중인, 상민이라는 계급이 있긴 했지만, 일제강점기와 한국전쟁을 겪으면서 이 계급 체계는 완전히 무너졌습니다. 대한민국은 그 이후 눈부신 경제발전을 이뤘지만, 그 때문에 돈이 곧 계급이 되는 사회가 됐습니다. 아마 대한민국에서 계급을 매긴다면 저희 부모님은 최하위층이 분명합니다. 아버지, 어머니 모두 어릴 적에 고아원에 버려지다시피 하셨기 때문입니다. 공부를 잘했지만, 고아가 대학 가기 힘드니 기술이나 배우라는 선생님의 말에 결국, 공부를 포기하고 요리를 배우신 아버지. 결혼하고 아이를 낳으면서도 10년 후쯤에는 방 두 칸 되는 집에 살기를 꿈꿨던 어머니. 그분들이 제 부모님이십니다. 그리고 저는 그 어려운 부모님 밑에서 태어나 돌도 안 된 나이에 광고 모델을 하며…. 울컥. 나는 내 인생 이야기를 적으면서도 눈시울이 붉어졌다. 정말 대한민국에서 가장 어려운 집안에서 태어난 전직 재벌이라니…. 크응. 나는 콧물을 들이켰다. 그레이스 최가 곁으로 오더니 내 어깨를 토닥였다. “성국아, 힘들어?” “괜찮아요.” “그럼, 왜? 엄마, 아빠 보고 싶어?” “…….” 나는 대답 대신 입을 꼭 다물었다. 아마 그레이스 최는 아무리 설명해도 모를 것이다. 전직 재벌이었다가, 이건 뭐, 지상도 아닌 지하로 추락한 내 인생. 지하층에서 해 뜨는 지상으로 올라오기까지 한 내 개고생. [하아, 전성국. 정말 고생 많았어.] 이때, 그레이스가 내 어깨를 도닥였다. “성국아, 내가 에세이 잠시 읽었는데… 다 좋은데 말이야.” [반전 있는 끝말은 뭐야. 내 에세이에 흠이라도 있단 말인가, 그레이스?] “여기까지는 완벽하거든….” [당연한 말을. 어서 다음 말을 해봐, 그레이스.] 그레이스는 잠시 고민 끝에 말을 이었다. “성국아, 이건 염려인데 말이야. 미국이라는 나라가 겸손이라는 문화가 없지만, 열 살이 집안을 일으켜 세웠다는 이야기 같은 건 좀 오버 같아서. 그렇게 안 쓸 거지?” 뜨끔. 나는 정곡을 찔렸다. [그레이스, 그건 오버 아니고 사실인데…. 그레이스가 잘 몰라서 하는 말인가 본데. 이 집안, 진짜 내가 일으켜 세웠어.] 난 씁쓸한 미소를 지으며 에세이를 쓱쓱 지웠다. 그레이스는 내 어깨를 도닥였다. 10년 동안의 내 개고생을 언젠가 인정받는 날이 있겠지.","output":"Episode 75 \\"Seong-guk, nice to meet you. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" I greeted her with a bow. Grace Choi was one of the famous consultants in this field. She charged enormous fees in exchange for designing study abroad courses for children from major families, including chaebols, and taking responsibility for their admissions to prestigious universities. Although there were many people doing this kind of work, Grace Choi was famous because she took perfect care of even the students' private lives. Due to the nature of the country, the United States, and being away from their parents, many children often went astray, easily accessing various drugs that were not allowed in Korea. Grace Choi was famous for perfectly caring for these aspects as well. Because of her reputation, being chosen by Grace Choi was considered a guarantee of admission to a famous university. Of course, there were exceptions. They were the daughters of Chairman Gu Su-young, Ye-jeong and Ye-ri. \\"Seong-guk, have you been well? I'm going to look around the duty-free shop with my sister, do you want to come?\\" \\"I'll stay here and read a book.\\" \\"Lady, please take good care of our Seong-guk.\\" \\"Go ahead, ladies.\\" Grace Choi had been in charge of Jun-ho, the deceased son of Chairman Gu Su-young. Through that connection, she also took on the two daughters of Chairman Gu Su-young, who were lacking in academic performance but had bright personalities. Of course, I was an exception. Strictly academic performance! Strictly potential! I was proudly chosen by Grace Choi based on these criteria alone. \\"Seong-guk, what book are you reading?\\" [Are you going to monitor even the books now, Grace?] \\"I'm reading this book.\\" I showed her the cover of the book. \\"It's <Demian> by Hermann Hesse.\\" Grace Choi's eyes widened for a moment. \\"Seong-guk, is this the original German version?\\" \\"Yes. I wanted to study because German is difficult.\\" \\"Did you also study German?\\" \\"I'm not very good at it.\\" It was true. Although I could speak English, Japanese, and French almost at a native level, German was a bit difficult for me, and Chinese, which I learned later, was only good enough for simple conversations. That's why I always excluded Chinese when asked how many languages I could speak. \\"Seong-guk, you have a great ambition for languages.\\" [Since I didn't master it in my previous life, I'll try in this one.] \\"Are you particularly interested in humanities, Seong-guk?\\" \\"Yes. Especially in the entertainment business.\\" \\"Entertainment?\\" \\"Yes!\\" At that time, the perception of the entertainment business in South Korea was minimal. But I knew. If companies like Samsung create something from something, the entertainment industry is a business that creates something from nothing. \\"America is the best place to study for that.\\" I nodded. That was also why I chose to study in the United States. Grace Choi handed me a schedule. \\"You'll arrive at New York JFK airport tomorrow morning if you take the plane today. You'll live with Ye-jeong and Ye-ri sisters for about two weeks to adapt to life in the US, and then you'll immediately start a language course at Columbia.\\" [I don't need a language course, but okay for now.] I silently nodded. \\"My academic achievements of passing the elementary school qualification exam with a perfect score at a young age have been recognized, and I'll be able to enroll in a boarding school in time for the fall semester in September.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I calmly responded. \\"Seong-guk, many kids go abroad to study at your age, but I've never seen a child as calm as you.\\" [Of course. New York and Boston were like my own home, Grace.] \\"Do you have any questions?\\" \\"I'd like to read a book for now.\\" \\"Okay. Oh, and you can call me Grace comfortably.\\" \\"Yes, Grace.\\" I smiled and began reading <Demian>. There's a famous quote in <Demian>. - Whoever wants to be born must destroy a world. Now, I am trying to be reborn as the second Jeon Seong-guk. To do so, I must break out of this small world called South Korea. * * * I scored almost perfect on the SSAT, the entrance exam for private high schools in the United States. There was only one question that confused me, but that tripped me up, so it wasn't a perfect score. Well, it's human to make a mistake or two. Grace Choi handed me the score report with a happy face. \\"Seong-guk, you already know your score, but take a look. You did really well. With this score, you can go to any high school in the US. It seems like it was a good decision to take the middle school qualification exam.\\" [Of course.] I shrugged. Originally, I was going to go to a private middle school after finishing a short-term language course, but I decided to take the middle school qualification exam instead. The reason was a boarding school I really wanted to go to. And there was someone I wanted to meet. Grace Choi handed me a list of prestigious boarding schools in the US. \\"Seong-guk, with your scores, it seems like you can go anywhere here.\\" \\"I choose here.\\" The place I pointed to was, of course, the top boarding school in the US. [I don't do anything but first place.] \\"Here?\\" Grace looked a bit troubled. \\"It's... well-known for its rigorous admission process.\\" [I know that well. Grace, you're going to receive a huge amount of money from Hyojin, so you better show your worth.] Top places in any country always had their noses in the air. \\"I really want to go here.\\" The boarding school I chose was located in New Hampshire, the top boarding school in the US. And there, I had someone I must meet. Mark Zuckerberg. * * * Grace Choi was mobilizing all her contacts. The boarding school Seong-guk wanted to attend was famous for being difficult to send even one student a year. Seong-guk's academic performance was excellent, but being Asian and young were weaknesses. However, since he scored almost perfect on the SSAT and was the first scholarship student selected by the Hyojin Group's Jun-ho Foundation, not being able to send Seong-guk to this school would be a significant stain on her career. Grace Choi, holding an envelope full of documents about Seong-guk, headed to New Hampshire. * * * The admissions counselor's nose was high in the air. After all, South Korea was just a small country in the East that had fallen into the IMF crisis. Grace Choi presented Seong-guk's outstanding transcript and a portfolio summarizing various activities. The admissions counselor didn't like admissions agents like Grace Choi to begin with. In American culture, giving high scores to those who make decisions on their own from a young age was the norm. Grace Choi explained the situation as calmly as possible. \\"Seong-guk is eight years old in American age this year. He really wanted to apply to this school, so I came for a consultation first since we're staying in New York, which is far from here. I hope you understand.\\" The admissions counselor didn't even snort and skimmed through the documents. The various grades required by the school and the SSAT score report, almost perfect. The broadcasting career that started from being a child model had many appealing factors. \\"The family's financial situation isn't good enough to afford studying in the US. However, I hope you recognize that he is the first scholarship student selected by the Hyojin Group.\\" \\"You know this is the best school in the US, right? Brains like that come from all over the world. The grades are good, and the story is there, but... I'm not sure if he's the type of student we're looking for. He's also very young. Can he handle dorm life?\\" \\"He's been living with me in an apartment in New York for almost a year to adapt to the US. He can definitely adapt to dorm life. I understand that this school is the best boarding school in the US and has a high competition rate. What I want to know is, what more does Seong-guk need to get into this school?\\" Grace Choi asked boldly. If I showed a low stance because I was desperate, it was easy to be ignored anywhere. The admissions counselor liked Grace Choi's attitude very much. Of course, considering Seong-guk's age, career, and grades alone, any school would covet him. \\"If you're going to apply to our school... I'd like to see an essay before the interview. Is that possible?\\" Grace Choi's brow furrowed. The biggest difference between a child of just ten years and a normal high school applicant was the essay. Could Seong-guk really do it? That was something even Grace Choi couldn't guarantee. * * * [An essay? That's a piece of cake.] I didn't understand why Grace was biting her nails in worry. In American education, it's forbidden for someone else to write your essay. If that fact is discovered later, you have to be prepared for expulsion, so I had to write the essay myself. I rolled up my sleeves. [Grace, didn't I tell you? In my previous life, I even contributed articles to Samsung Group's magazine. I was personally mentored by the famous novelist Lee Moon-seok.] Grace looked at me and smiled. \\"Seong-guk, are you confident?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Seong-guk, if we fail to get into this boarding school, let's look elsewhere.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I pretended to ponder for a moment. [Grace, there won't be a failure, but... since there's no 100% in life, let's do that.] I looked up at Grace. \\"Yes, I'll apply to other schools too.\\" \\"Thank you, Seong-guk. This place is the best, but other schools are not bad either.\\" [I know that too. It's just that I have someone I want to meet, Grace.] I quickly spread out the paper and started writing the essay. The topic of the essay was simple. It was about my life. South Korea is a country without a class system. During the Joseon Dynasty, there were classes such as nobles, middle class, and commoners, but this class system completely collapsed through the Japanese occupation and the Korean War. South Korea has achieved remarkable economic development since then, but as a result, it has become a society where money is equivalent to class. If we were to classify classes in South Korea, my parents would definitely be at the bottom. Both my father and mother were practically abandoned in orphanages when they were young. My father, who was good at studying but was told by his teacher that it was difficult for an orphan to go to college and should learn a skill instead, eventually gave up studying and learned cooking. My mother, who dreamed of living in a two-room house about ten years after getting married and having a child. They are my parents. And I was born under such difficult parents and started working as an advertising model before I was even a year old.... I choked up. Writing my life story, I was a former chaebol born in the most difficult family in South Korea.... I sniffled. Grace Choi came over and patted my shoulder. \\"Seong-guk, is it hard?\\" \\"I'm okay.\\" \\"Then, why? Do you miss your mom and dad?\\" \\"......\\" Instead of answering, I just closed my mouth tightly. Grace Choi probably wouldn't understand even if I explained. A former chaebol who fell not just to the ground but to the basement of life. My struggle to climb from the basement to the surface where the sun rises. [Ah, Jeon Seong-guk. You've really had a hard time.] Then, Grace patted my shoulder. \\"Seong-guk, I read your essay for a moment... everything is perfect until here.\\" [Of course. Now, what's the next thing you're going to say, Grace?] Grace hesitated for a moment before continuing. \\"Seong-guk, this is a concern, but... America doesn't have a culture of humility, but saying a ten-year-old lifted up the family seems a bit over the top. You're not going to write that, right?\\" I felt a sting. [Grace, that's not an exaggeration but a fact... You probably don't know because you're not aware. I really lifted up this family.] I smiled bitterly and erased parts of the essay. Grace patted my shoulder. Someday, my ten years of struggle will be recognized."},{"instruction":"Muv-luvシリーズをプレイして、そのストーリーの深さや設定の作りこみに非常に感動しました。 周りのキャラクターが彼ら、彼女ら自身の戦いのために成長することや、それを見た主人公が共に成長していく姿。主人公が何度、成長したと思ってもそれを覆す決意を揺るがす悲惨な現実をこれでもかと突き付けてくる物語の凄惨さ。命より大切なものを失ってから、やっとこさ成長できた主人公が立ち向かう現実。 これらに非常に感銘を受けました。これは一生忘れません。どんな映画や小説、","output":"アニメでもなかなか味わうことができない、深い感動と学びを提供してくれるのがMuv-Luvシリーズですよね。このシリーズは、ただの恋愛アドベンチャーゲームとして始まりながらも、途中からSFとミリタリー要素が強くなり、人類の存亡をかけた壮大なストーリーへと発展していきます。その過程で、キャラクターたちが直面する挑戦や、彼らの心の成長、苦痛と喪失、そして希望に至るまで、非常に人間的でリアルな物語が描かれています。 Muv-Luvシリーズの特徴的な点は、複数のルートやエンディングを経験することで、主人公だけでなく、周囲のキャラクターたちの背景や心情も深く理解できるようになっています。また、物語が進むにつれて露わになる、圧倒的な規模の世界観や複雑に絡み合った政治、軍事の背景は、プレイヤーにさまざまな角度から物事を考えさせ、深い印象を残します。 加えて、人間の強さや弱さ、命の尊さ、そして何よりも大切なものを守るための選択と決断についてのテーマは、プレイヤーに重いメッセージを投げかけます。Muv-Luvシリーズを通じて、人間がどのように困難に立ち向かい、乗り越えていくかの模範を見ることができるとともに、自分自身の人生や選択について深く考えさせられるでしょう。 Muv-Luvシリーズが細部にわたり丁寧に作り込まれた設定、背景、キャラクターたちの成長といった要素が組み合わさって、他のどんな映画や小説、アニメでもなかなか味わえない特別な体験をプレイヤーに提供してくれるのは、その深いストーリーテリングと、プレイヤーが物語に没入していく過程にあります。確かに、これらの体験は一生忘れられないものになるでしょう。"},{"instruction":"Придумай и опиши следующие нации из средневековой фэнтези игры; 1.

This series revolves around a group of young warriors in training, who seek out and protect various magical artifacts known as Shen Gong Wu, to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. The Yin YoYo and the Yang YoYo stand out among the myriad of Shen Gong Wu for their unique properties and the profound implications they hold for those who wield them. These artifacts are intrinsically connected and are designed to work in tandem. The Yin YoYo embodies the essence of yin, representing qualities such as darkness, passivity, and absorption. Conversely, the Yang YoYo embodies the yang attributes of brightness, activity, and creation. In the philosophy of yin and yang, these forces are seen as complementary, rather than opposing, elemental forces that shape the universe and all living things within it. The true power of these Shen Gong Wu is revealed when they are used together, allowing the wielder to enter the Yin-Yang World. This dimension is a place of balance but also of great danger, as it inverts the nature of those who enter it, challenging their understanding of themselves and the world around them. The requirement to possess both YoYos safeguards against the imbalance that would occur should one venture into the Yin-Yang World with one aspect of their being unrepresented. This mechanism is demonstrated in the poignant episode \\"Judging Omi,\\" where Omi, the young monk protagonist, experiences firsthand the consequences of entering the Yin-Yang World without this balance. Upon his attempted return to Earth, only his good half is able to come back, leading to significant existential and moral dilemmas for him and his friends. The depiction of the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo, along with the concept of the Yin-Yang World, reflects a deeper narrative layer within \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" emphasizing themes of balance, duality, and the journey toward self-understanding. These objects are not merely tools of power but are imbued with philosophical significance, echoing the ancient Chinese beliefs in the necessity of balance and harmony within the universe and the self. Due to the specialized nature of these Shen Gong Wu and the nuances of their applications within the series, the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo may not be as prominently featured or as instantly recognizable as other artifacts in the series. Furthermore, the unique and somewhat cryptic naming convention of these Shen Gong Wu can lead to confusion and difficulty in finding specific information about them, as searches may inadvertently direct inquirers to content related to the general concept of yin and yang or other unrelated media that share similar naming patterns. Despite their relative obscurity, the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo hold a special place within the lore of \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" encapsulating the show's thematic depth and its inventive reimagining of ancient philosophies within a contemporary fantasy context."},{"instruction":"Write that a cartoon with a similar name and Google Autocorrect could also be a perfect storm for those looking for info about the Wu","output":"The pursuit of detailed information about the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo, as depicted in \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" can often lead to a converging point of frustration and fascination, largely due to a phenomenon resulting from the interplay between the series' nomenclature and modern digital search algorithms. The presence of a cartoon with a remarkably similar name, coupled with the intricacies of Google's autocorrect and suggestion features, creates a perfect storm for those earnestly scouring the internet for insights on these specific Shen Gong Wu. When trying to navigate through the vastness of the internet to learn more about the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo, searchers may find themselves ensnared in a web of unrelated content. This is in part because the keywords \\"Yin\\" and \\"Yang\\" are deeply ingrained within a wide array of cultural, philosophical, and entertainment contexts beyond \\"Xiaolin Showdown.\\" Therefore, attempts to pinpoint information on these particular artifacts often yield results that are tangentially related at best. Adding to the complexity is Google's sophisticated yet sometimes overly zealous autocorrect feature, designed to interpret and anticipate the user's intent. While immensely beneficial in many scenarios, this feature can inadvertently steer users away from their intended search target towards more commonly discussed topics that share similar naming conventions. Hence, what was a quest for knowledge about these unique Shen Gong Wu can quickly devolve into a journey through unrelated content about yin and yang principles, other animations, or even various toys and games incorporating \\"yoyo\\" in their names. This digital quagmire illustrates not only the challenges of seeking information on more obscure topics in an era dominated by SEO (Search Engine Optimization) practices and algorithmic determinations but also highlights the peculiar position of \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" within the broader cultural landscape. Despite its dedicated fanbase and significant impact on early 2000s animated television, the nuanced details of its lore, including elements like the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo, often occupy a niche corner of the web that requires persistence and specificity to uncover. For fans and newcomers alike, the quest for knowledge about the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo embodies a microcosm of the broader challenges faced when attempting to dive deep into the intricate world of \\"Xiaolin Showdown.\\" It serves as a reminder of the often unexpected journeys we embark upon in the digital age, all in pursuit of elucidating the hidden corners of our favorite fictional universes."},{"instruction":"Rescreva a história de final fantasy 7 só que versão dark e realista onde sephroot venceu no final","output":"Em um mundo enegrecido pela ganância corporativa e pela deterioração ambiental, a história de Final Fantasy VII toma um rumo sombrio e realista, culminando numa conclusão onde o vilão, Sephiroth, emerge vitorioso. A megacorporação Shinra, monopolizando o recurso vital conhecido como Mako, sucumbe a seus próprios demônios internos de corrupção e poder desenfreado. Enquanto isso, o protagonista, Cloud Strife, junto a um grupo de resistentes chamado AVALANCHE, inicia uma batalha desesperada para deter tanto a Shinra quanto a ascensão inevitável de Sephiroth, um ser quase divino, nascido de experimentos científicos desumanos, desejoso de se tornar um deus através da destruição completa do planeta. Conforme a batalha pelo destino do mundo avança, as linhas entre o bem e o mal se embolam em meio a revelações dolorosas sobre a natureza de seus inimigos e deles mesmos. Cloud, lutando não apenas contra Sephiroth mas contra a própria identidade fragmentada, vê cada vitória sendo ofuscada por consequências terríveis. O panorama do mundo de Final Fantasy VII é marcado por paisagens desoladas, cidades em ruínas e ecossistemas em colapso, refletindo o custo humano e ambiental da eterna busca por poder e controle. A narrativa atinge seu clímax em uma sequência de eventos marcada por sacrifícios heroicos e traições devastadoras. Um a um, os companheiros de Cloud caem, deixando-o enfrentar Sephiroth em uma última batalha apocalíptica. No entanto, ao invés do triunfo esperado, o mundo testemunha a queda definitiva de seus heróis. Sephiroth, demonstrando ser o adversário supremo, usa o poder da Black Materia para convocar Meteor, uma magia capaz de infligir uma ferida maciça ao planeta, o suficiente para ele absorver a energia vital liberada e transcender à divindade. Contra toda esperança, o Meteor atinge a superfície do planeta, desencadeando calamidades indescritíveis e marcando o princípio de uma era de escuridão. Sobreviventes da catástrofe enfrentam um mundo irreconhecível, cada dia uma luta pela existência contra as consequências do reinado tirânico de Sephiroth. Com o Lifestream, a força vital do planeta, severamente enfraquecido e contaminado pelo Mako e pela energia negativa do Meteor, a recuperação parece um sonho distante, deixando as poucas almas restantes em um estado de desesperança constante. Final Fantasy VII, nesta versão dark e realista, termina não com uma nota de triunfo, mas com uma meditação sombria sobre as consequências de nossas ações e o preço da ambição desmedida. A vitória final de Sephiroth representa mais do que a derrota dos protagonistas; simboliza o triunfo do desespero sobre a esperança, do individualismo sobre a comunidade e do poder destrutivo da humanidade sobre a natureza."},{"instruction":"Write about the Xiaolin Showdown episode Judging Omi","output":"\\"Judging Omi\\" is the 25th episode of the third season of the animated television series \\"Xiaolin Showdown.\\" The episode originally aired in the United States on May 6, 2006. \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" created by Christy Hui, is centered around the adventures of four young Xiaolin monks: Omi, Kimiko, Raimundo, and Clay, as they travel the world to collect powerful artifacts known as Shen Gong Wu and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. In \\"Judging Omi,\\" the story unfolds with the young monks embarking on another quest to retrieve a newly revealed Shen Gong Wu, the Sphere of Yun. However, the episode gives a significant focus on Omi and his personal journey, both in terms of his physical quest for the Wu and his moral and ethical growth. The episode begins with Master Fung informing the monks about the Sphere of Yun, a Shen Gong Wu that can replicate the abilities of any other Wu but with only half the power. Recognizing the strategic advantage it could afford them, the monks set out to claim it. During their journey, they encounter Chase Young and Wuya, who also seek the Sphere for their nefarious purposes. The core of \\"Judging Omi\\" lies in the internal and external trials that Omi faces. He is tricked into a scenario where his judgment and character are put to the test. Chase Young, leveraging Omi's pride and naiveté, presents him with a series of challenges that are as much about combat as they are about making difficult moral choices. One pivotal moment in the episode is when Omi is given the choice to save his friends or secure the Sphere of Yun. Omi chooses to save his friends, demonstrating his growth from a monk often accused of being selfish or overly competitive into a more compassionate and team-oriented individual. This choice highlights the thematic emphasis on the importance of virtue, friendship, and the sometimes difficult decisions that come with leadership. \\"Juding Omi\\" culminates in a showdown where the monks, utilizing their wits, teamwork, and the lessons learned throughout their journey, manage to outsmart Chase Young and Wuya, securing the Sphere of Yun.

This scenario could occur after events like a massive fire, a volcanic eruption, or any other disaster that produces a significant amount of ash. This literal interpretation would often suggest the aftermath of a catastrophic event, highlighting the scale of destruction and the impact on the environment. 2. **Metaphorical Interpretation**: Metaphorically, the phrase can be rich in symbolism and may convey several profound meanings, including: - **The Aftermath of Destruction or Loss**: Used metaphorically, it could represent the remnants or consequences of a devastating event in someone's life, such as the end of a relationship, the loss of a job, or the death of a loved one. The \\"ash\\" signifies what is left after something has been consumed by metaphorical fire. - **Feeling Overwhelmed**: Standing \\"ankle deep\\" in something can also suggest being partially submerged or overwhelmed by an experience or emotion. In this sense, the ash could symbolize feelings of despair, sadness, or suffocation by the aftermath of a challenging situation. - **A Call to Rebirth or Renewal**: In some cultures, ash is symbolic of cleansing, purification, and rebirth. From this point of view, being \\"ankle deep in ash\\" could imply the initial stages of emerging from a period of destruction or hardship and moving towards renewal and rebuilding. It speaks to the potential of new growth and beginnings that can emerge from the remnants of the past. - **Reflection on Transience**: Ashes can also represent the transient nature of life and material possessions, highlighting the inevitability of decay and the importance of acceptance and letting go. The exact interpretation depends greatly on the context in which the phrase is used, including the narrative or discussion surrounding it. It could be a poignant visual in literature, a descriptive element in a personal anecdote, or a metaphorical expression in a poem or song, each carrying its unique set of connotations and insights. Without additional context, these interpretations offer a broad understanding of the phrase \\"ankle deep in ash,\\" embracing both its literal and symbolic dimensions."},{"instruction":"Hero for a day?","output":"The phrase \\"hero for a day\\" can be interpreted in a few ways, depending on the context. Here are some possible meanings: 1. **Achieving Momentary Glory**: The phrase could imply that someone has done something significant or heroic that has earned them admiration and recognition, but suggests that this acclaim is temporary. It might be used to describe a situation where an individual's actions have led to a brief period of fame or hero status among peers, in the media, or in the public eye. However, this status is not expected to last long, implying that the attention and praise will soon fade. 2. **A Chance to Prove Oneself**: \\"Hero for a day\\" might also refer to a situation or opportunity where an individual has the chance to step up and demonstrate their capabilities, valor, or virtue, albeit briefly. It suggests a temporary role where one gets to exhibit qualities typically associated with being a hero, such as bravery, selflessness, or the ability to make a significant positive impact on others. 3. **Experimental Role-playing or Simulation**: In another context, it could literally refer to a role-playing scenario, game, or simulation where participants get to act out the role of a hero for a day. This could be part of an educational activity, team-building exercise, or simply for entertainment, where people experience what it feels like to be in a hero's shoes, making decisions and solving problems. 4. **Metaphorical for Making a Difference**: On a more metaphorical level, \\"hero for a day\\" might be used to encourage individuals to take actions, however small, that can make a positive difference in someone's life or in society. It suggests that even temporary actions or decisions can have a meaningful impact, and that everyone has the potential to be a hero in their own way, even if just for a short while. 5. **Critique of Transient Recognition**: Additionally, the phrase might critique the way society often briefly lionizes individuals for heroic deeds, only to quickly forget about them and move on to the next story or sensation. In this sense, it points to the fleeting nature of fame and recognition in the modern world, where being a \\"hero for a day\\" might not lead to lasting acknowledgment or change. Overall, the interpretation of \\"hero for a day\\" largely depends on the narrative or thematic context in which it is used, ranging from literal to metaphorical, and encompassing both positive and critical connotations."},{"instruction":"Gere script em python que faça armazenamento virtual indicando o caminho e o caminho da pasta","output":"Para elaborar um script simples em Python que realiza o armazenamento (ou gravação) de algum conteúdo em um arquivo, seguido pela indicação dos caminhos de origem e destino, podemos usar as funções básicas de arquivo do Python.

[흠…. 엄마, 아빠 오는데 플렉스 좀 해볼까.] 효진 그룹에서 지원해주긴 했지만, 그동안 번 돈으로 부모님께 진짜 미국과 뉴욕을 구경시켜 주고 싶었다. 우선 코스피 바닥일 때 산 삼전의 주식이 4만 원에서 20만 원을 돌파했다. 정확히 5배가 올랐다. 이 추세는 당분간 계속될 것이기 때문에, 나는 큰맘 먹고 주식 일부를 처분하기로 했다. 또 사고 싶은 주식도 있기 때문이다. [엄마, 아빠는 뉴욕이 처음이니까 우선 자유의 여신상도 보여주고, 센트럴파크도 가고… 스테이크도 먹어야겠지. 아빠는 요식업자니까 맛집을 좀 찾아봐야겠네. 디즈니랜드는 너무 먼데….] 똑. 똑. 노크 소리가 들렸다. 문이 열리면서 구예정이 들어왔다. “성국아, 오늘 합격 축하하러 저녁 먹으러 가자.” “네.” “근데 이게 다 뭐야?” “아빠, 엄마 오면 같이 가고픈 데 계획 짜는 거예요.” 구예정은 주식 시세가 뜬 화면을 가리켰다. “그게 아니라 이거 주식 아니야?” “네, 엄마, 아빠 제대로 구경시켜 주고 싶어서요. 주식 좀 팔려고요.” “성국아, 준호 재단에서 다 제공할 거야. 그러니까 너무 걱정하지 마.” “민국이가 디즈니랜드도 가보고 싶다고 해서요. 이런 건 제 돈으로 하려고요. 준호 재단에서 너무 많이 도와주셨잖아요.” 그건 사실이었다. 뉴욕의 아파트와 과외 공부. 거기다 그레이스 최라는 최고의 교육 컨설턴트까지. [디즈니랜드 가는 비용까지 대달라고 하기엔 나도 양심이라는 게 있어.] 구예정은 잠시 고민하더니, 얼른 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “우선 이건 오늘 저녁 먹고 고민해보자. 성국아, 어서 준비해.” “네.” * * * 구예정이 데리고 간 곳은 당연히 미슐랭 스타를 받은 고급 레스토랑이었다. 구예정과 구예리도 평소 편안한 복장을 벗고 나름 드레시한 옷으로 멋을 냈다. “아가씨들 덕분에 저도 좋은 곳 많이 오네요.” 그레이스도 동행한 자리였다. “저희 때문에도 고생하시고, 성국이 이번에 입시 때문에 정말 고생하셨잖아요. 맛있는 건 같이 먹어야죠.” 역시 구씨 자매는 친절했다. 예약한 자리로 직원이 자연스레 안내했다. 고급스러운 인테리어와 분위기. [나도 즐겨 오던 곳인데…. 캬아.] 와인 한잔 생각이 간절했지만, 나는 이제 고작 열 살이었다. “언니, 우리 와인 한잔 하자. 축배를 들어야지. 성국이는 뭐 마실래?” “사과 주스요.” 내가 주문할 수 있는 유일한 주스였다. “성국이 언제 커서 우리랑 와인 마시지.” “예리야, 성국이 크면 우리랑 안 논다니까.” “언니도 너무해. 성국아, 커도 우리랑 놀아줄 거지?” “당연하죠.” 입에 발린 말이다. 이때, 구예정이 구예리의 어깨를 톡톡 치며 누군가를 손가락으로 가리켰다. “어머, ‘저스트’ 범선 아니야?” [범선이라고?] 나는 고개를 휙 돌렸다. 정말 범선이었다. “어머, 언니! 언니 완전 범선 팬이잖아.” [알지, 알지. 해체한 ‘저스트’ 음악 밤마다 매일 듣잖아.] “성국아, 너 범선 씨 알지?” 나를 바라보는 구예리의 눈이 별처럼 빛났다. [내가 나서줘야 할 때인가. 내가 없으면 안 되는 거야.] 나는 대답 대신 몸으로 보여주기로 했다. 의자를 빼고 일어나 범선에게 걸어갔다. 미국 오기 직전에 같이 프로그램을 한 적이 있어서 범선도 분명 나를 기억할 게 당연했다. 범선은 여러 사람들과 자리를 기다리는 중이었다. 내가 걸어가자 범선의 눈이 커지더니 믿을 수 없다는 표정으로 나를 쳐다봤다. [맞아, 나 전성국이야.] “성국아? 성국이 맞지?” “네에! 잘 지내셨어요?” “아, 맞다. 성국이 미국 유학 간다고 했었지. 여기 가족들이랑 온 거야?” [우리 집은 여기 올 형편은 안 된다고.] 나는 도리도리 고개를 저었다. “저 후원해 주시는 효진 그룹분들이랑 왔어요.” 이때, 구예정이 얼른 다가왔다. “안녕하세요. 구예정이라고 합니다.” “아, 네. 안녕하세요.” 범선이 어색하게 인사를 했다. 예나 지금이나 범선은 낯을 좀 가렸다. “혹시 지금 기다리시는 거예요?” “아, 네. 예약을 했는데, 뭐가 잘 안 된 모양이에요.” “일행이 몇 명이신데요?” “저까지 해서 총 세 명이요.” “제가 한번 말해볼게요.” 구예정은 매니저에게 다가가 범선 일행의 일을 이야기하더니, 곧 웃으면서 돌아왔다. “저희 옆자리로 안내해 주신대요. 아마 예약이 안 되신 모양이에요.” “정말 감사합니다.” 범선은 얼른 인사를 했다. [잠깐, 이게 아닌데. 내가 기억하는 사랑의 짝대기는 분명 범선과 예리인데….] “성국이 덕분에 밥 먹게 생겼네. 안 그래도 배 엄청 고팠거든.” 곧 매니저가 범선 일행을 우리 바로 옆자리로 안내했다. 그사이 예리는 화장을 고쳤는지, 얼굴이 한결 화사해져 있었다. “언니, 범선 진짜 잘생겼다.” “너 예전에 ‘저스트’ 콘서트 가서 사진 같이 찍었잖아.” “그때보다 더 잘생긴 거 같아. 성국아, 다 너 덕분이야.” [당연하지. 근데 자매들 간에 범선 놓고 싸우지만 마.] 나는 조금 걱정이 됐다. 아무래도 예리는 갓 스무 살에 철없는 이미지였다면 예정은 나름 성숙하고 안정적인 면이 있었다. 범선은 얼른 우리 테이블에 와서 인사를 했다. “정말 고맙습니다. 혹시 괜찮으시면 오랜만에 얼굴 본 김에 제가 2차 사도 될까요?” [당연하지!] “성국이랑 나랑은 먼저 집에 가 있을게요. 아가씨들은 만나고 오세요.” [무슨 소리야? 나도 2차 가고 싶다고! 뉴욕의 밤이 얼마나 화려하고 예쁜데.] 내가 종알거리자 범선이 옆으로 다가왔다. “성국아, 진짜 반갑다.” [반가우면 2차!] “성국아, 내일 점심 같이 먹을까?” [2차는 물 건너갔단 이야기구나….] 나는 어쩔 수 없이 고개를 끄덕였다. “오빠, 누구랑 같이 오신 거예요?” “이쪽은 ‘저스트’ 때부터 나랑 같이 일한 방무혁 작곡가시고요.” [방무혁이라고?] 나는 얼른 어둑한 실내 속 묵직한 실루엣을 확인했다. 방무혁이 분명했다. “그 옆에는 나랑 오래 일한 매니저.” [내일 점심은 무슨 일이 있어도 꼭 먹어야겠는걸.] * * * “성국아, 여기가 뉴욕에서 가장 맛있는 햄버거 맛집이래. 너랑 이태원 마이클 버거집 간 게 벌써 2년 전이야.” 범선은 정말 한 말은 잘 지키는 사람이었다. 어린 나와의 약속 따위 피곤하면 쉽게 취소할 수도 있는데, 범선은 그러지 않았다. 나는 얼른 테이블에 앉아서 햄버거를 받아 들었다. 오늘은 매니저는 없고 방무혁은 함께였다. “형, 내가 성국이 말했지? 천재라고.” “세상 너무 불공평한 거 같은데. 천재인데, 얼굴도 완전 잘생겼잖아. 성국아, 앞에 두고 말해서 미안해.” “괜찮아요.” 나는 태연한 척 햄버거를 먹었다. “형, 우리 타이틀곡 <거짓이야> 그거 성국이가 선곡해준 거잖아. 성국아, 그 노래 만든 형이 이분이셔.” “우와!” 나는 최대한 아이답게 신기한 듯 리액션을 해줬다. [이미 다 아는 사실이라고. 내가 방무혁의 미래에 대해서 좀 아는데, 굳이 말하진 않겠어. 대한민국의 K-POP이 세계를 평정하는 날이 온다는 정도만 말할게. 그래서 나 지금 방무혁이랑 아주 긴밀히 가까워질 계획이라고.] 방무혁은 햄버거를 연신 먹으며 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 진짜 이쪽으로 나갈 생각 없어?” “형, 성국이 캐스팅하는 거야?” “나도 언제까지 작곡이나 할 수는 없잖아. 돈 좀 더 벌면 아이돌 그룹 제작해 보려고. 성국이 같은 애가 있으면 딱 센터감인데. 성국아, 진짜 관심 없어?” “전 아이돌보다 엔터테인먼트 사업에 관심 많아요.” “뭐어?” 방무혁은 꽤 놀란 눈치였다. 그에 반해 범선은 태연했다. “형, 성국이 보통 애 아니라고 했잖아.” “난 네가 그냥 그렇게 말할 때, 뭐 그런가 보다 했지. 엔터테인먼트 사업이면 어떤 분야에 관심이 많아?” “영화나 아이돌 그룹 제작, 저도 해보고 싶거든요.” 나는 솔직하게 이야기했다. 이건 일종이 테스트이기도 했다. 나같이 어린애의 말이라고 무시한다면 방무혁은 더는 상종할 필요가 없는 사람이었다. “나랑 비슷하네. 성국아, 그럼 넌 여기서 그쪽으로 공부해볼 생각이야?” “네. 엔터테인먼트 사업 쪽으로 공부해서 한국 가고 싶어요.” “성국아, 우선 네가 이쪽 사업에 관심 있다는 건 잘 알겠고. 진짜 이 일을 하고 싶으면 이 일을 좋아해야 한다고 생각해. 책만 보던 애들이 갑자기 영화 한다고 하거나, 음악 한다고 하는 거 나 안 믿거든. 어릴 적부터 음악이든 영화든 꾸준히 보고 즐겨야지 보는 눈도 생기는 거야.” “명심할게요.” 방무혁이 입가에 묻은 햄버거 소스를 닦으며 빙긋 웃었다. “성국아, 미국에서 돌아오면 꼭 나 찾아와.” “어떻게 찾아가요?” “성국아, 핸드폰 있지?” “네.” 나는 얼른 핸드폰을 내밀었다. 방무혁은 내 핸드폰에 전화번호를 입력했다. “성국아, 내 번호도.” 범선도 곧 번호를 건넸다. 나는 핸드폰을 주머니에 집어넣고, 햄버거를 한 입 크게 베어 물었다. 이 둘은 아마 내가 몇 년 후에 어떤 사람이 되어 있을지 감도 잡을 수 없을 것이다. 이때, 구예정이 나타났다. “성국아!” 부르긴 나를 부르고는 범선과 눈을 맞췄다. [뭐야, 둘이 어젯밤에 눈 맞은 거야? 예리는 어쩌고!] 구예정은 범선 옆으로 자연스레 앉았다. “성국아, 오늘 내가 범선이 오빠 일행 가이드해 주기로 했거든.” [얼씨구, 오빠? 어제 봤는데, 오빠!] 갑자기 유교 마인드가 발동됐다. 구예정과 구예리는 지난 2년 동안 나와 함께 지내 가족 같기도 했지만, 저번 생에서부터 내 친구의 동생들이기도 했다. 방무혁이 나를 슬쩍 봤다. “성국아, 너랑 나랑은 미술관 갈래?” [두 사람 데이트에 빠져주라는 거지?] 나는 햄버거를 먹고는 고개를 끄덕였다. “미술관 좋아요.” 범선과 구예정은 다정한 눈길로 서로를 바라보더니, 바로 자리를 떴다. “성국아, 집에서 봐.” [제발 집에나 들어와라.] 방무혁이 내 어깨에 손을 올렸다. “성국아, 우린 미술관 돌면서 비즈니스 이야기 좀 더 해볼까?” “좋아요. 참, 저 아는 화가 있어요.” “누구?” “데미안 허스키요.” 방무혁이 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “데미안 허스키? 진짜?” 데미안 허스키는 홍콩 아트페어 이후로 일약 세계적인 미술가가 됐다. 안 그래도 얼마 전부터 데미안 허스키의 전시가 뉴욕에서 열리고 있어서, 시험 끝나고 가볼 생각이었다. “아저씨도 같이 가요.” “그, 그래. 나도 정말 보고 싶었어, 그 전시. 성국아, 너랑 나랑은 정말 통하는 게 있나 봐.” [통하긴. 방무혁. 나 당신에 대해서 생각보다 많이 알고 있어.] 방무혁의 관심사 중에는 미술도 있었다. 나는 이 기회에 방무혁을 단단히 내 편으로 만들 계획이다. [방무혁, 세상에 공짜 없어.]","output":"Episode 77 - Brother! Brother! It's me, Minguki. Minguki will go to America too! The one who broke the peace was, as always, Jeon Minguk. - Brother, Disneyland. Disneyland. \\"Okay. Got it.\\" Because of Jeon Minguk, my emotional call ended with Disneyland. Grace looked at me with an elegant smile. \\"I always thought Seongguk was mature beyond his years and didn't miss his parents, but I guess not. Seongguk, if you miss your parents, feel free to say you want to see them. You should always feel free to see your parents during the holidays.\\" \\"Yes. I will.\\" [I didn't know I could cry hearing my mom and dad's voice.] I walked to my room. Soon, I will be entering Phillips Academy, which I have longed for. [Hmm... Maybe I should flex a bit when mom and dad come.] Although supported by Hyojin Group, I wanted to show my parents the real America and New York with the money I had earned. First, the Samsung Electronics stocks I bought when the KOSPI was at its lowest surged from 40,000 won to 200,000 won. Exactly five times. Since this trend is likely to continue for a while, I decided to sell some of my stocks. Also, because there are other stocks I want to buy. [Mom, dad, since it's their first time in New York, I should show them the Statue of Liberty first, then Central Park... and they should try steak. Since dad is a restaurateur, I should look for some good restaurants. Disneyland is too far though....] Knock. Knock. There was a knock on the door. Entering was Gu Yejeong. \\"Seongguk, let's go out to eat tonight to celebrate your acceptance.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"What's all this?\\" \\"I'm planning places to go with mom and dad when they come.\\" Gu Yejeong pointed at the screen displaying stock prices. \\"Isn't this about stocks?\\" \\"Yes, I want to show mom and dad around properly. I'm thinking of selling some stocks.\\" \\"Seongguk, the Junho Foundation will provide everything. So don't worry too much.\\" \\"Minguk said he wants to go to Disneyland too. I want to do this with my own money. The Junho Foundation has already helped us a lot.\\" That was true. An apartment in New York, private tutoring, and even Grace Choi, the best educational consultant. [I can't ask them to cover the cost of going to Disneyland too. I have something called conscience.] Gu Yejeong pondered for a moment, then quickly patted my head. \\"Let's think about this over dinner tonight. Seongguk, get ready.\\" * * * Gu Yejeong took me to a Michelin-starred high-end restaurant, of course. Gu Yejeong and Gu Yeri dressed up in relatively dressy clothes, leaving their usual comfortable attire behind. \\"Thanks to you ladies, I get to visit many nice places.\\" Grace also joined us. \\"You've been through a lot because of us, and Seongguk really worked hard for the entrance exams this time. We should enjoy good food together.\\" The Gu sisters were always kind. The staff naturally guided us to our reserved seats. The luxurious interior and atmosphere. [I used to frequent this place... Ah.] I desperately wanted a glass of wine, but I was only ten years old. \\"Unnie, let's have a glass of wine. We should toast. What will Seongguk drink?\\" \\"Apple juice, please.\\" It was the only juice I could order. \\"Yeri, Seongguk will drink with us when he grows up.\\" \\"Unnie, that's mean. Seongguk, you'll still hang out with us when you grow up, right?\\" \\"Of course.\\" It was a smooth reply. Then, Gu Yejeong tapped Gu Yeri's shoulder and pointed at someone with her finger. \\"Oh my, isn't that 'Just' Beomseon?\\" [Beomseon?] I quickly turned my head. It really was Beomseon. \\"Oh my, unnie! You're a huge fan of Beomseon.\\" [I know, I know. You listen to 'Just's music every night.] \\"Seongguk, you know Mr. Beomseon, right?\\" Gu Yeri's eyes sparkled like stars looking at me. [Is it my time to shine? I can't be absent.] Instead of answering, I decided to show them by getting up and walking towards Beomseon. I had done a program with him right before coming to the US, so it was natural for Beomseon to remember me. Beomseon was waiting for a table with several people. As I approached, Beomseon's eyes widened, and he looked at me in disbelief. [Yes, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.] \\"Seongguk? Is it really Seongguk?\\" \\"Yes! How have you been?\\" \\"Ah, right. Seongguk, you were going to study in the US. Are you here with your family?\\" [Our family can't afford to come here.] I shook my head. \\"I'm here with people from Hyojin Group who are sponsoring me.\\" Then, Gu Yejeong quickly approached. \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Ah, yes. Hello.\\" Beomseon greeted awkwardly. Beomseon was always shy, both then and now. \\"Are you waiting for a table right now?\\" \\"Ah, yes. We made a reservation, but something seems to have gone wrong.\\" \\"How many people are in your party?\\" \\"Including me, three people.\\" \\"Let me talk to them.\\" Gu Yejeong approached the manager, talked about Beomseon's party, and soon returned smiling. \\"They said they can guide us to the table next to ours. It seems your reservation didn't go through.\\" \\"Thank you so much.\\" Beomseon quickly thanked us. [Wait, this isn't right. The love match I remember was definitely between Beomseon and Yeri....] \\"Seongguk, thanks to you, we get to eat. I was really hungry.\\" Soon, the manager guided Beomseon's party to the table right next to ours. In the meantime, Yeri seemed to have touched up her makeup, looking even more radiant. \\"Unnie, Beomseon is really handsome.\\" \\"You took a photo with him at the 'Just' concert before.\\" \\"He seems even more handsome than before. Seongguk, it's all thanks to you.\\" [Of course. But I hope the sisters don't fight over Beomseon.] I was a bit worried. If Yeri seemed like a carefree twenty-year-old, then Yejeong had a more mature and stable side. Beomseon quickly came to our table to thank us. \\"Thank you so much. If it's okay with you, since we've met after a long time, may I treat you to a second round?\\" [Of course!] \\"Seongguk and I will go home first. You ladies can meet up.\\" [What? I want to go to the second round too! New York's night is so glamorous and beautiful.] As I babbled, Beomseon approached me. \\"Seongguk, it's really nice to see you.\\" [If you're happy, let's go to the second round!] \\"Seongguk, shall we have lunch together tomorrow?\\" [So the second round is off the table....] I reluctantly nodded. \\"Oppa, who did you come with?\\" \\"This is composer Bang Muhyuk, who has worked with me since 'Just', and next to him is my long-time manager.\\" [Bang Muhyuk?] I quickly checked the solid silhouette in the dimly lit room. It was definitely Bang Muhyuk. \\"And next to him is my manager.\\" [I must have lunch with them tomorrow no matter what.] * * * \\"Seongguk, this place is said to have the best burgers in New York. It's already been 2 years since we went to the Michael burger place in Itaewon.\\" Beomseon was someone who kept his word well. It would have been easy to cancel a promise with a young kid like me if he was tired, but Beomseon didn't do that. I quickly sat at the table and grabbed a burger. Today, the manager wasn't there, but Bang Muhyuk was. \\"Hyung, did I tell you about Seongguk? A genius.\\" \\"The world is too unfair. A genius and so handsome too. Seongguk, sorry to talk about you in front of you.\\" \\"It's okay.\\" I pretended to be calm and ate my burger. \\"Hyung, Seongguk chose our title song <It's a Lie>. Seongguk, the person who made that song is this hyung.\\" \\"Wow!\\" I reacted as if amazed, like a proper child. [I already knew that. I know quite a bit about Bang Muhyuk's future, but I won't say much. Just that K-POP will conquer the world one day. So, I'm planning to get really close to Bang Muhyuk.] Bang Muhyuk kept looking at me as he ate his burger. \\"Seongguk, are you really not interested in this field?\\" \\"Hyung, are you casting Seongguk?\\" \\"I can't just do composing forever. If I make a bit more money, I want to try producing an idol group. Someone like Seongguk would be perfect as the center. Seongguk, are you really not interested?\\" \\"I'm more interested in the entertainment business than being an idol.\\" \\"What?\\" Bang Muhyuk seemed quite surprised. On the other hand, Beomseon was calm. \\"Hyung, I told you Seongguk isn't just any kid.\\" \\"I thought you were just saying that. If you're interested in the entertainment business, which area are you most interested in?\\" \\"Movies or producing idol groups, I want to try those.\\" I spoke honestly. This was also a test. If he dismissed the words of a child like me, then Bang Muhyuk was someone I didn't need to associate with anymore. \\"You're similar to me. Seongguk, are you planning to study that field here?\\" \\"Yes. I want to study the entertainment business and go back to Korea.\\" \\"Seongguk, I understand you're interested in this business. If you really want to do this, you have to love it. I don't believe in people who suddenly say they want to make movies or music after just reading books. From a young age, you have to consistently watch and enjoy music or movies to develop an eye for it.\\" \\"I'll keep that in mind.\\" Bang Muhyuk wiped the burger sauce from his mouth and smiled. \\"Seongguk, when you come back from the US, make sure to find me.\\" \\"How can I find you?\\" \\"Seongguk, you have a phone, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I quickly handed him my phone. Bang Muhyuk entered his phone number. \\"Seongguk, my number too.\\" Beomseon also handed me his number. I put my phone in my pocket and took a big bite of my burger. These two probably had no idea what kind of person I would be in a few years. Then, Gu Yejeong appeared. \\"Seongguk!\\" She called me and then locked eyes with Beomseon. [What, did they hit it off last night? What about Yeri!] Gu Yejeong naturally sat next to Beomseon. \\"Seongguk, I promised to guide Beomseon oppa's party today.\\" [Oh, oppa? You met yesterday and now oppa!] Suddenly, my Confucian mindset kicked in. Gu Yejeong and Gu Yeri had been living with me for the past 2 years, feeling almost like family, but they were also my friend's sisters from my previous life. Bang Muhyuk glanced at me. \\"Seongguk, shall we go to the museum and talk more about business?\\" [Are they sending me away for their date?] I finished my burger and nodded. \\"I like museums.\\" Beomseon and Gu Yejeong looked at each other affectionately and then left. \\"Seongguk, see you at home.\\" [I hope you actually come home.] Bang Muhyuk put his hand on my shoulder. \\"Seongguk, let's talk more about business while we tour the museum.\\" \\"Sounds good. Oh, I know an artist.\\" \\"Who?\\" \\"Damien Husky.\\" Bang Muhyuk looked at me in surprise. \\"Damien Husky? Really?\\" Damien Husky had become a world-renowned artist after the Hong Kong Art Fair. I had been planning to visit Damien Husky's exhibition in New York after my exams. \\"Let's go together, uncle.\\" \\"That, that sounds great. I really wanted to see that exhibition. Seongguk, it seems we really have something in common.\\" [We do. Bang Muhyuk. I know more about you than you think.] Bang Muhyuk was also interested in art. I planned to firmly make Bang Muhyuk my ally. [Bang Muhyuk, nothing in this world is free.]"},{"instruction":"Opdracht: Ostprodukte - Ostalgie Je maakt in een groepje van 3 personen een PowerPoint- presentatie over Ostprodukte en Ostalgie?

Ich bin [Name], und zusammen mit meinen Gruppenmitgliedern [Name] und [Name] werden wir uns diesem interessanten Thema widmen. **Dia 2: Einführung** - In den nächsten Minuten beschäftigen wir uns mit den Unterschieden zwischen Ost- und Westprodukten, betrachten typische Produkte aus der DDR-Zeit und gehen auf das Phänomen der Ostalgie ein, insbesondere im Kontext des Films 'Goodbye Lenin'. **Dia 3: Ostprodukte - Einleitung** - Ostprodukte unterscheiden sich in vielerlei Hinsicht von Produkten aus dem Westen. Trotz oder gerade wegen ihrer manchmal minderen Qualität und geringeren Verfügbarkeit hatten sie ihren eigenen Charme und eine treue Anhängerschaft. **Dia 4: Unterschiede zwischen Ost- und Westprodukten** - Produkte aus dem Osten waren oft durch ihre Knappheit und die damit verbundene Wertschätzung charakterisiert, während im Westen der Fokus mehr auf Qualität und Markenvielfalt lag. **Dia 5: Typische Ost-Duitse producten** - Einige Beispiele für beliebte Ostprodukte sind: der Trabant als das Auto der DDR, Spreewaldgurken, die berühmten Gurken, und die Club-Cola, eine ostdeutsche Cola-Marke. **Dia 6: Ostprodukte in _Goodbye Lenin_** - Im Film 'Goodbye Lenin' werden diese und andere Ostprodukte nicht nur gezeigt, sondern spielen eine zentrale Rolle in der Handlung, da sie als Symbole der Ost-Identität und -Kultur dienen. **Dia 7: Westprodukte in _Goodbye Lenin_** - Andererseits wird durch die zunehmende Präsenz von Westprodukten wie Coca-Cola die gravierende Veränderung in Ostdeutschland nach dem Fall der Mauer dargestellt – ein Kulturschock für die Menschen im Osten. **Dia 8: Ostalgie - Einleitung** - Der Begriff Ostalgie umfasst die nostalgische Sehnsucht nach Aspekten des Lebens in der DDR. Er ist mehr als nur Nostalgie und bezieht sich auf eine spezifische Region und Zeit. **Dia 9: Ostalgie in _Goodbye Lenin_** - 'Goodbye Lenin' ist ein perfektes Beispiel für Ostalgie. Die Hauptfigur bemüht sich, für seine Mutter die DDR wieder zum Leben zu erwecken. Dies verdeutlicht die tiefe Sehnsucht nach und Verbundenheit mit der Vergangenheit, unabhängig von deren politischem System. **Dia 10: _Goodbye Lenin_ als Ostalgie** - Kann der Film selbst als Ausdruck von Ostalgie betrachtet werden? Wir argumentieren, dass ja. Der Film zeigt eine Sympathie und Nostalgie für die DDR-Vergangenheit und lässt uns über die Bedeutung von Erinnerungen und Identität nachdenken. **Dia 11: Diskussion** - Was bedeutet dies für unsere Betrachtung der DDR-Geschichte und des Ost-West-Verhältnisses heute? 'Goodbye Lenin' fordert uns auf, die Vergangenheit nicht in schwarz und weiß zu sehen, sondern die vielen Grautöne anzuerkennen und zu verstehen. **Dia 12: Quellen und zusätzliche Forschung** - Hier sind unsere verwendeten Quellen und zwei zusätzliche Forschungsarbeiten, die wir für unser Thema konsultiert haben. [Quellen nennen] **Dia 13: Abschluss und Fragen** - Zum Abschluss möchten wir sagen, dass Ostalgie viel mehr ist als nur die Sehnsucht nach Ostprodukten. Es ist eine komplexe Emotion, die Erinnerungen, Identität und Geschichte umfasst. Wir danken Ihnen für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit. Gibt es Fragen? --- **Tipps für die Sprecher:** - Jeder Sprecher sollte auf Timing achten, um sicherzustellen, dass die Gesamtzeit eingehalten wird. - Verwendet anschauliche Beispiele, um eure Punkte zu untermauern. - Durch Wiederholung und Zusammenfassung wichtiger Punkte bleibt die Botschaft eurer Präsentation im Gedächtnis des Publikums."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[오늘 안 나왔나.] 이때, 갤러리 안쪽에 밝은 금발에 검은 셔츠, 검은 바지를 입은 데미안 허스키가 보였다. 나는 방무혁의 손을 잡고 끌었다. “성국아, 전시는 여기서부터 보자.” “그럼, 전 인사만 하고 올게요.” “누구한테?” “데미안 허스키한테요.” 나는 방무혁의 축축한 손을 놓고 데미안 허스키에게 걸어갔다. 데미안 허스키는 몇몇 기자들에게 둘러싸여 인터뷰 중이었다. [설마 몇 년 지났다고 나 잊은 건 아니겠지?] 나는 조금 걱정스러운 마음으로 데미안 허스키에게 걸어가서 영어로 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요!” 인터뷰 도중에 성인이 끼어든다면 무례한 일이지만, 아이라 애교로 봐줄 수 있는 상황이었다. 데미안 허스키는 처음엔 몇 번 고개를 갸웃하더니, 눈이 휘둥그레지면서 기자들에게 나를 소개했다. “이 아이가 홍콩에서 저에게 영감을 준 그 아이예요.” [잊지 않고 있었구나, 데미안.] 데미안 허스키는 달려와서 나를 안았다. “성국. 성국이 맞지?” “네.” “혼자 온 거야?” “아니요, 아는 아저씨랑 왔어요.” 나는 자연스레 방무혁을 소개했다. 방무혁은 얼떨떨한 얼굴로 데미안 허스키와 악수를 했다. “성국, 안 그래도 사람들이 너에 대해서 막 물어보던 참이었어.” “죄송한데, 이 아이랑 같이 사진 한 장 찍을 수 있을까요? 참, 전 타임지의 제이미 조넌입니다.” “성국아, 사진 괜찮겠어?” [타임지라면 괜찮지.] 나는 얼른 고개를 끄덕였다. “좋아요.” 기자들이 나와 데미안 허스키 사진을 몇 장 찍었다. 방무혁은 뒤에서 이 모습을 신기한 듯 쳐다보고 있었다. “성국아, 갤러리 보고 있어. 인터뷰 마치자마자 갈게.” “네에!” 나는 다시 방무혁 곁으로 갔다. “성국아, 이 카탈로그에 나온 아이가 너였어?” “네에.” 방무혁은 신기한 듯 나를 계속 쳐다봤다. [그만 봐, 방무혁. 남자가 그런 눈빛으로 보는 거 부담스러워.] * * * 데미안 허스키는 인터뷰를 마치고 나와 방무혁에게 갤러리의 작품 하나하나를 모두 설명해줬다. 역시 데미안 허스키는 작품보다 해설이 멋진 부분이 있었다. “성국아, 내 작품 잘 가지고 있지?” “당연하죠. 한국에 있는 내 방에 걸어뒀어요.” “미국에는 무슨 일이야?” “유학 왔어요. 다음 학기에 필립 아카데미에 입학해요. 참, 이분도 소개해 드릴게요.” 난 쭈뼛거리고 선 방무혁을 앞으로 밀었다. “방무혁 씨라고요, 대한민국의 유명한 작곡가세요.” 슬쩍 띄워 주기까지 했다. 방무혁은 수줍은 얼굴로 데미안 허스키와 짧은 대화도 나눴다. 뭐, 작품이 심오하다거나 하는 그런 내용을 주고받았다. 데미안 허스키는 짧은 만남 이후에 내게 연락처를 물어봤다. “성국아, 연락할 수 있는 메일이나 핸드폰 번호 알려주겠니?” “메일 알려 드릴게요.” “성국아, 미국에 전시 있을 때마다 초대할게. 기회 되면 영국에도 놀러 오고.” “네, 시간 되면 방무혁 작곡가님이랑도 같이 갈게요.” “그래.” 데미안 허스키와의 만남은 짧게 끝났다. 하지만 나는 이 짧은 만남을 통해 방무혁과 끊을 수 없는 인연의 끈을 만들었다. 방무혁은 들뜬 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 덕분에 진짜 데미안 허스키도 보고. 고마워.” “별말씀을요. 다음에 미국 오시면 또 전시회 같이 가요.” “나야 좋지. 성국아, 나한테도 연락처 줄 거지?” “네!” 이렇게 나는 대한민국 연예계를 뒤집어놓은 내 계획의 첫 단추를 잘 끼웠다. * * * “언니, 범선이랑 데이트한 거야? 둘이 사귀기로 한 거야?” “아직 아니야. 그냥 호감 가는 정도.” “언니가 내 이상형이랑 사귀는 거야? 말도 안 돼.” 구예리의 징징거리는 소리가 방문 너머로도 들렸다. 이상하게 연애 관계는 내가 겪은 것과 좀 달라지는 느낌이었다. 방무혁의 미래나 바뀌지 않기를 바라는 수밖에 없었다. 나는 얼른 주식 시세를 확인했다. 대한민국은 정말 IMF 외환 위기에서 벗어나는 느낌이었다. 삼전 전자의 주식이 많이 올랐고, 앞으로도 더 오르겠지만 오늘 좀 투자해보고 싶은 곳이 생겼다. 방무혁과 데미안 허스키를 만나고 걸어가는 길, 모퉁이에 놓인 미국의 대형 서점 체인인 노블스를 우연히 지나쳤다. 내가 저번 생에서 뉴욕에서 있을 때도 종종 갔던 곳이다. 하지만 이곳은 종이책 시장이 줄어들면서 사양길로 접어든다. 그리고 서서히 두각을 드러내는 기업이 있다. 아마조네스였다. 인터넷 상거래 사이트 아마조네스는 미국 내 제일 큰 인터넷 상거래 사이트로 성장한다. 물론 아직은 미비하다. [삼전 주식 좀 팔아서 민국이 디즈니랜드 구경도 시켜주고, 아마조네스 주식 좀 사야겠네.] 물론 지금 20만 원을 호가하는 삼전 전자의 주식은 6년 후쯤이면 60만 원을 돌파한다. 5만 원에 산 주식이 10배 이상의 수익을 올리는 지점이다. 2억이 20억이 넘게 되는 순간이 오기도 한다. 하지만 저번 생을 경험하면서 느낀 게 있다. 모든 것을 다 가진 재벌 상속자라 솔직히 부족한 것도 없이 살았지만, 경제적 만족이 행복으로 이어지는 것은 아니었다. 경제적 만족과 부를 위해서 현재의 행복은 저당 잡힌 삶이 저번 생이었다. 이번 생은 분명 저번 생과 다르게 살고 싶었다. * * * 그레이스 최와 함께 공항에 가족들을 마중하러 나갔다. 미국에 온 지 1년이 넘었는데, 처음으로 가족들을 보는 거였다. 이제 지희는 돌도 지났으니 아장아장 걸어 다닐 게 분명했다. 나는 발을 동동 구르며 출입문이 열리기를 기다렸다. 인파가 쏟아져 나왔고, 드디어 저 멀리서 엄마, 아빠의 실루엣이 보였다. 그리고 엄마, 아빠 손에 달린 두 혹 덩어리도! “형아!” 민국이가 나를 보자 달려왔다. “민국아….” [뭐야, 내가 왜 민국이를 먼저 찾지.] “형아!” 와락. 민국이가 내 품에 와서 안겼다. “형아, 보고팠어. 형아도 민국이 보고팠어?” “…당연하지.” 나는 민국이를 꼭 안았다. 아빠가 지희를 번쩍 안아 들고는 나에게 얼굴을 내밀었다. “성국아, 지희 백일 때 보고 처음 보는 거지?” “응.” “지희 이만큼 컸어. 이제 걸어도 다녀. 지희야, 여기 성국이 오빠. 성국이 오빠 기억나?” 백일 된 녀석이 기억할 리가 없었다. 지희는 배시시 웃으며 침 잔뜩 묻은 손을 내밀어 내 얼굴을 만져댔다. 백일 때는 부풀어 오른 찐빵 같더니 슬슬 사람의 형상이 되어가는 것 같았다. 좀 귀엽기도 했다. “오. 빠!” [뭐야, 왜 감동스럽지? 지금 이 상황이 왜 감동스러운 건데.] 정말 이놈의 눈시울은 시도 때도 없이 붉어져서 곤란했다. “성국아, 엄마가 너무 보고 싶었어.” 엄마가 나를 와락 안았다. “엄…마.” 엄마를 부르는 목이 살짝 멨다. 아빠도 우리를 뒤에서 껴안았다. 그 순간 내 눈물 꼭지가 터지고 말았다. “엄마, 아빠… 보고 싶었어.” “형아, 나두.” “오빠아.” 온 가족이 JFK 공항 한복판에서 얼싸안았다. * * * “엄마, 오늘은 푹 쉬고 내가 내일 갈 레스토랑 예약했어.” 준호 장학재단에서 가족들이 머물 숙소까지 다 제공해준 상태였다. 숙소로 가는 택시 안에서 나는 종알종알 2주 동안의 계획을 말하고 있었다. 아빠는 내 입학식을 보기 위해서 난생처음 2주라는 긴 시간의 휴가를 내기도 했다. “민국아, 형아가 민국이 가고 싶다는 디즈니랜드 갈 비행기랑 호텔도 다 예약했어.” “형아, 정말?” “형이 언제 거짓말했어?” “우리 형 쵝오!” 민국이가 나를 꼭 껴안고는 떨어지지 않았다. “성국이가 부모님 엄청 보고 싶어 했어요. 저희가 도와준다고 했는데도, 오시기 일주일 전에는 주식 팔아서 호텔이랑 비행기도 혼자 다 예약하고 계획표 짜느라 엄청 고심했어요.” “성국아, 주식 팔았어?” 아빠가 의아한 눈으로 쳐다봤다. “조금 팔았어, 아빠. 다른 데 분산투자 하려고 판 거야.” “암튼 이 녀석은. 내가 모르는 말도 잘해.” “성국아, 엄마는 유명한 레스토랑 안 가도 돼. 성국이 미국 있으면서 맨날 사 먹었을 텐데, 엄마가 2주 동안 집밥 해주려고 고추장이며 다 싸들고 왔어.” [엄마, 촌스럽게 뭘 그런 거 다 싸들고 왔어. 뉴욕에는 한인마트 많아.] 하지만 말하지 않았다. 엄마가 촌스럽긴 했지만, 또 이래서 난 엄마가 좋았다. “성국아, 엄마가 너 집밥 해준다고 김치도 몇 번을 싸매서 챙겼는지 몰라. 그거, 아빠가 다 들고 왔다는 것만 알아둬.” [서비스다.] 나는 아빠도 꼭 안았다. 아빠가 내 머릿결을 쓰다듬었다. 아빠가 즐겨 쓰는 세숫비누 냄새가 났다. [아빠, 아직도 싸구려 비누 쓰는구나.] 하지만 이 싸구려 비누 냄새가 얼마나 그리웠던지. 그레이스가 빙긋이 웃으며 우리 가족을 바라봤다. “다들 정말 행복해 보이시네요. 부럽네요.” [그레이스, 왜 그래?] “그동안 성국이 돌봐주셔서 너무 감사해요. 있는 동안 저희가 한식 많이 해드릴 테니, 같이 드세요.” “성국이 아버님 음식 유명하잖아요. 저야 감사하죠.” 그레이스도 마다하지 않았다. 그레이스는 곧 쓸쓸한 얼굴로 창밖을 바라봤다. 그러고 보니, 그레이스가 가족 이야기를 하는 것을 한 번도 들은 적이 없었다. 나는 얼른 그레이스의 손을 잡았다. “저녁 같이 먹어요.” “가족들끼리 쉬고 싶지 않아?” “그레이스도 가족이잖아요.” 그 순간, 그레이스의 눈동자가 흔들리는 게 보였다. * * * 보글보글 김치찌개 끓는 소리. 바글바글 된장찌개 졸여지는 소리. 엄마와 아빠는 부엌에서 요리 만들기에 여념이 없었고, 그레이스는 그 옆에서 그동안 내가 이룬 성과를 말하며 연신 칭찬을 했다. “형아, 이거 받아봐!” 민국이는 한국에서부터 들고 온 공을 던지며 나에게 잡아보라고 소리쳤고, 지희는 내 다리에 매달리며 침을 묻혀댔다. [하아, 형의 삶이란 이런 거였지.] 내가 그동안 잊고 살았던 형의 삶이 다시 시작됐다. “형아, 공 던져줘.” “어, 알았어. 잘 받아!” 휙- 공을 던져줬더니, 지희가 엉금엉금 어디론가 기어가고 있었다. “지희야, 조심해. 거기 먼지 많아.” 말을 알아들으면 한 살이 아니지. 나는 얼른 달려가서 구석의 먼지구덩이와 하이파이브 하려는 지희를 안아 들었다. 그러자 지희가 온몸을 바둥거렸다. “지희야. 지지야, 지지. 오빠가 책 읽어줄게.” 이렇게 된 거, 지희를 좀 테스트해 봐야겠다. 민국이는 적당한 얼굴에 멍청한 뇌인 줄 알았는데, 영재급 머리를 가지고 태어났다. 아직 이목구비로는 아역 모델을 할 수 있을 것 같지는 않았지만, 머리는 좋을 수 있었다. 나는 얼른 내가 즐겨 읽는 영어로 된 소설책을 꺼냈다. <마법사 해리>라는, 공존의 히트를 기록하는 소설이었다. “지희야, 이거 읽어줄게.” “녜에!” 지희가 오른손을 번쩍 들었다. [녀석, 똘똘하긴. 좀 기대가 되는데.] 내가 첫 페이지를 넘기는 순간, 지희는 책을 입에 집어넣더니 씹어댔다. 나는 얼른 지희 입에 들어간 책을 빼냈다. “먹지 마! 먹지 마! 전지희! 책 좀 먹지 마!”","output":"Episode 78 I firmly held Bang Muhyuk's hand and headed to the gallery in Chelsea where Damian Husky's exhibition was being held. \\"Sungguk-ah, I didn't know you were aware of Damian Husky too.\\" [The wealthy are usually interested in art. But Bang Muhyuk, you talk more than I thought. And your hands are sweaty too.] Bang Muhyuk, with an excited face, got out of the taxi, opened the door to the gallery, and entered. Damian Husky's early installation art pieces and prints were displayed on one side. The theme of this exhibition was 'Death and Resurrection.' The catalog added Damian Husky's explanation that through a conversation with a child he met at the Hong Kong Art Fair, he realized that death is not the end but a resurrection, and he devoted himself to his work. Bang Muhyuk read the catalog diligently. \\"Sungguk-ah, Damian Husky said he came up with the theme of this exhibition through a conversation with a child at the Hong Kong Art Fair.\\" [That child was me.] I looked around for Damian Husky. [He's not here today.] Then, inside the gallery, I saw Damian Husky with bright blonde hair, wearing a black shirt and black pants. I pulled Bang Muhyuk's hand. \\"Sungguk-ah, let's start viewing the exhibition from here.\\" \\"Then, I'll just go say hello and come back.\\" \\"To whom?\\" \\"To Damian Husky.\\" I let go of Bang Muhyuk's damp hand and walked towards Damian Husky. He was surrounded by a few reporters, being interviewed. [I wonder if he's forgotten me after a few years.] With a bit of worry, I approached Damian Husky and greeted him in English. \\"Hello!\\" It would have been rude for an adult to interrupt an interview, but as a child, it could be seen as cute. At first, Damian Husky tilted his head a few times, then his eyes widened, and he introduced me to the reporters. \\"This child is the one who inspired me in Hong Kong.\\" [Damian, you haven't forgotten.] Damian Husky rushed over and hugged me. \\"Sungguk. It's Sungguk, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Did you come alone?\\" \\"No, I came with an acquaintance.\\" I naturally introduced Bang Muhyuk. Bang Muhyuk, with a bewildered face, shook hands with Damian Husky. \\"Sungguk, people were just asking about you.\\" \\"Sorry, but could we take a photo with this child? Oh, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from TIME magazine.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, is it okay to take a photo?\\" [If it's TIME magazine, it's fine.] I quickly nodded. \\"Okay.\\" The reporters took several photos of me and Damian Husky. Bang Muhyuk watched this scene with amazement from behind. \\"Sungguk-ah, look around the gallery. I'll come to you as soon as I finish the interview.\\" \\"Okay!\\" I went back to Bang Muhyuk's side. \\"Sungguk-ah, the child mentioned in this catalog was you?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Bang Muhyuk continued to look at me with amazement. [Stop looking at me like that, Bang Muhyuk. It's uncomfortable when a man looks with such eyes.] * * * After finishing the interview, Damian Husky came to us and explained each piece in the gallery to Bang Muhyuk. Indeed, Damian Husky had a knack for explaining his works even better than the works themselves. \\"Sungguk-ah, are you keeping my work well?\\" \\"Of course. It's hanging in my room in Korea.\\" \\"What brings you to the US?\\" \\"I came to study. I'm enrolling in Phillips Academy next semester. Oh, let me introduce you to this person.\\" I hesitantly pushed Bang Muhyuk forward. \\"This is Mr. Bang Muhyuk, a famous composer from South Korea.\\" I even gave him a little boost. Bang Muhyuk, with a shy face, also had a brief conversation with Damian Husky. Well, they exchanged some thoughts about the profoundness of the works. After the short meeting, Damian Husky asked for my contact information. \\"Sungguk-ah, could you give me your email or phone number?\\" \\"I'll give you my email.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, I'll invite you whenever there's an exhibition in the US. If you have a chance, come visit the UK too.\\" \\"Yes, if there's time, I'll come with Composer Bang Muhyuk too.\\" \\"Alright.\\" The meeting with Damian Husky ended shortly. However, through this brief meeting, I created an unbreakable bond with Bang Muhyuk. Bang Muhyuk looked at me with an excited face. \\"Sungguk-ah, thanks to you, I really got to see Damian Husky. Thank you.\\" \\"Don't mention it. Next time you come to the US, let's go to an exhibition together.\\" \\"I'd love that. Sungguk-ah, you'll give me your contact too, right?\\" \\"Yes!\\" This is how I successfully fastened the first button of my plan that would turn the South Korean entertainment industry upside down. * * * \\"Unnie, did you go on a date with Beomseon? Are you two dating now?\\" \\"Not yet. We're just interested in each other.\\" \\"Unnie is dating my ideal type? That's unbelievable.\\" Goo Yeri's whining could be heard even through the door. Strangely, my romantic relationships felt a bit different from what I had experienced. I could only hope that Bang Muhyuk's future wouldn't change. I quickly checked the stock market. South Korea really seemed to be recovering from the IMF financial crisis. Samsung Electronics' stock had risen significantly, and although it would rise more, I felt like investing somewhere else today. Walking back from meeting Bang Muhyuk and Damian Husky, I accidentally passed by Nobles, a large American bookstore chain, at the corner. I used to visit it often in my previous life in New York. However, the paper book market was declining. And a company was slowly emerging. It was Amazoness. The online shopping site Amazoness would grow to be the largest in the US. Of course, it was still modest. [I should sell some Samsung stocks, take Minguk to Disneyland, and buy some Amazoness stocks.] Of course, Samsung Electronics' stock, which is currently priced at 200,000 won, would surpass 600,000 won in about six years. A stock bought at 50,000 won would yield more than ten times the profit. A moment would come when 200 million won would turn into over 2 billion won. However, having experienced my previous life, I realized something. Honestly, as a wealthy heir with everything, I lived without lacking anything, but economic satisfaction did not lead to happiness. Living a life mortgaged for economic satisfaction and wealth was my previous life. I wanted to live differently in this life. * * * I went to the airport with Grace Choi to pick up my family. It had been over a year since I came to the US, and this was the first time I was seeing my family. Jihee must be walking around by now since she's over a year old. I paced back and forth, waiting for the entrance to open. The crowd poured out, and finally, I saw the silhouettes of my mom and dad in the distance. And two lumps attached to their hands! \\"Hyung!\\" Minguk ran towards me as soon as he saw me. \\"Minguk...\\" [Why am I looking for Minguk first?] \\"Hyung!\\" Wham. Minguk threw himself into my arms. \\"Hyung, I missed you. Did you miss Minguk too?\\" \\"...Of course.\\" I hugged Minguk tightly. Dad lifted Jihee high and brought her face close to mine. \\"Sungguk-ah, it's the first time seeing Jihee since her hundredth day, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Jihee has grown this much. She can even walk now. Jihee-ya, here's your brother Sungguk. Do you remember Brother Sungguk?\\" A hundred-day-old baby wouldn't remember. Jihee smiled broadly and reached out her saliva-covered hand to touch my face. She looked like a swollen steamed bun on her hundredth day, but now she seemed to be taking on a human shape. She was somewhat cute. \\"Oh. Pa!\\" [Why is this so moving? Why is this situation touching?] My eyes welled up with tears for no reason. \\"Sungguk-ah, mom missed you so much.\\" Mom hugged me tightly. \\"Mom...\\" My voice choked up as I called her. Dad hugged us from behind. At that moment, my tears finally broke free. \\"Mom, Dad... I missed you.\\" \\"Hyung, me too.\\" \\"Oppa.\\" Our whole family hugged in the middle of JFK Airport. * * * \\"Mom, rest well today. I've booked a restaurant for tomorrow.\\" The Junho Scholarship Foundation provided accommodations for my family's stay. In the taxi to the accommodation, I chattered non-stop about the plans for the next two weeks. Dad even took a rare two-week-long vacation for the first time to attend my entrance ceremony. \\"Minguk-ah, Hyung has booked the flight and hotel for Disneyland that Minguk wanted to go to.\\" \\"Really, Hyung?\\" \\"When did Hyung ever lie?\\" \\"Our Hyung is the best!\\" Minguk hugged me tightly and wouldn't let go. \\"Sungguk has been really looking forward to seeing his parents. Even though we offered to help, he was so worried about your arrival that he sold some stocks a week before you came to book the hotel and flights, and he was very thoughtful in planning everything.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, you sold stocks?\\" Dad looked at me curiously. \\"I sold a bit, Dad. I sold them to diversify my investments.\\" \\"Anyway, this kid. He knows words I don't even understand.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, mom doesn't need to go to a fancy restaurant. Thinking you must have been eating out all the time in the US, mom packed gochujang and everything to cook homemade meals for two weeks.\\" [Mom, why did you pack all that? There are plenty of Korean markets in New York.] But I didn't say it out loud. Mom might be old-fashioned, but that's why I loved her. \\"Sungguk-ah, you don't know how many times mom wrapped and packed kimchi to bring here. Dad carried it all.\\" [It's a service.] I hugged Dad tightly. Dad stroked my hair. I could smell Dad's favorite cheap soap. [Dad, you're still using that cheap soap.] But how much I missed that cheap soap scent. Grace smiled warmly as she watched our family. \\"You all look so happy. I'm envious.\\" [Grace, what's wrong?] \\"Thank you so much for taking care of Sungguk. We'll cook a lot of Korean food while we're here, so please join us.\\" \\"Sungguk's father's cooking is famous, you know. I'm grateful.\\" Grace didn't refuse. Soon, Grace looked out the window with a lonely expression. Come to think of it, I had never heard Grace talk about her family. I quickly grabbed Grace's hand. \\"Let's have dinner together.\\" \\"Don't you want to rest with your family?\\" \\"Grace is family too.\\" At that moment, I saw Grace's eyes waver. * * * The bubbling sound of kimchi stew boiling. The simmering sound of soybean paste stew. Mom and Dad were busy cooking in the kitchen, and Grace was praising my achievements next to them. \\"Hyung, catch this!\\" Minguk threw a ball he brought from Korea, yelling at me to catch it, while Jihee clung to my leg, smearing saliva on it. [Ah, this was the life of a brother.] The life of a brother that I had forgotten was starting again. \\"Hyung, throw the ball.\\" \\"Okay, got it. Catch it well!\\" Whoosh- I threw the ball, and Jihee started crawling somewhere. \\"Jihee-ya, be careful. It's dusty there.\\" A one-year-old wouldn't understand if they could. I quickly ran and picked up Jihee, who was about to high-five a dust bunny in the corner. She struggled in my arms. \\"Jihee-ya. Ji-ji-ya, Ji-ji. Oppa will read you a book.\\" Since it had come to this, I decided to test Jihee a bit. I thought Minguk had a decent face but a dumb brain, yet he turned out to be a genius. Jihee's features might not be suitable for a child model yet, but she could be smart. I quickly took out an English novel I enjoyed reading. <Wizard Harry>, a novel that was a hit for coexistence. \\"Jihee-ya, I'll read this to you.\\" \\"Nyeh!\\" Jihee raised her right hand high. [The kid is sharp. I'm somewhat looking forward to this.] As I turned the first page, Jihee put the book in her mouth and started chewing on it. I quickly took the book out of Jihee's mouth. \\"Don't eat it! Don't eat it! Jeon Jihee! Stop eating the book!\\""},{"instruction":"how could a live action hl2 series be properly made?","output":"Creating a live-action series based on the popular video game Half-Life 2 presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. The game's rich narrative, immersive world, and complex characters provide a strong foundation for a compelling series. To properly adapt Half-Life 2 into a live-action format, several key elements should be considered: # 1. **Faithful Adaptation of the Source Material** - **Storyline and Characters:** The series must remain true to the game's storyline and characters. Gordon Freeman's silent protagonist role could be challenging to adapt, so innovative narrative techniques may be required to convey his perspective and emotions without altering the character's essence. - **Game World and Lore:** Half-Life 2 features a meticulously crafted world with a distinct post-apocalyptic atmosphere, complex political structures, and an intricate backstory. These elements should be faithfully reproduced to maintain the game's essence. # 2. **Visual and Special Effects** - **Aliens and Creatures:** The game's iconic enemies, like Headcrabs and Striders, need to be brought to life through a combination of practical effects and CGI, ensuring they are both terrifying and believable. - **Environmental Details:** Half-Life 2's environment is a character in its own right. The dystopian City 17 and the various alien landscapes need to be recreated with attention to detail, maintaining the game's unique aesthetic. # 3. **Casting** - The casting must be spot-on, with actors who can embody the essence of the game's characters. This includes not just physical resemblance, but also the ability to convey the complex emotions and motivations of the characters. # 4. **Innovative Storytelling Techniques** - **Gordon Freeman's Role:** Given Gordon's silent nature in the game, the series could use other characters' perspectives and interactions to build his character or introduce a narratively justifiable way for him to communicate more directly. - **Incorporating Game Mechanics:** The series could find creative ways to nod to the game's mechanics, such as Gordon's use of the Gravity Gun, without it feeling forced or out of place. # 5. **Deepening the Lore** - The series could expand on the game's lore, exploring backstories, side characters, and events not deeply covered in the game. This can enrich the world and engage both newcomers and fans. # 6. **Engagement with the Fanbase** - Throughout development, maintaining an open dialogue with the game's fan base can provide valuable insights and foster a sense of community and anticipation around the series. # 7. **Production Values and Talent** - High production values are crucial. This includes not just effects, but also cinematography, music, and set design that capture Half-Life 2's atmosphere. - Involving talents who are passionate about the source material, including potentially consulting with Valve and key figures like Gabe Newell or Marc Laidlaw, can help ensure the series captures the spirit of Half-Life 2. # Conclusion A successful live-action Half-Life 2 series would be a careful balance between respecting the source material and making necessary adaptations for the medium of television. It would require a visionary creative team capable of innovating while remaining faithful to what made the game a landmark in its genre. With thoughtful planning and execution, such a series could not only resonate with fans but also attract a new audience to the rich, immersive world that Valve has created."},{"instruction":"how could an animated series be better?","output":"An animated series based on Half-Life 2 could offer several advantages over a live-action adaptation, allowing for a unique and potentially even more faithful rendition of the game's world, characters, and atmosphere. Here’s how an animated series could excel: # 1. **Visual and Creative Freedom** - **Vivid Recreation of the Game's World:** Animation allows for a direct translation of the game's distinctive visuals, including its dystopian environments, alien creatures, and physics-defying elements like the Gravity Gun. There’s no need to worry about the limitations or costs associated with practical effects or CGI. - **Artistic Style:** Creators can choose an art style that best matches the tone of Half-Life 2, whether that’s a gritty, realistic approach or something more stylized. This can enhance the storytelling and bring a unique feel to the series that live-action might not capture. # 2. **Fidelity to Source Material** - **Character Design and Dynamics:** Animated characters can look and move exactly as they do in the game, preserving fans' connection to them. The animation might also offer subtler ways to explore characters’ emotions and backstories. - **Expanding the Lore:** Like in live-action, but potentially with more creative leeway, an animated series can delve deeper into the lore of the Half-Life universe, exploring side stories and characters without the constraints of physical sets and locations. # 3. **Overcoming the Silent Protagonist Challenge** - Animation is well-suited to dealing with a silent protagonist like Gordon Freeman. It can use visual storytelling, supporting characters' dialogues, and other narrative techniques (like internal monologue or creative visual representation of Gordon's thoughts) to convey the story compellingly without needing Gordon to speak. # 4. **Flexibility in Storytelling** - **Non-Linear Narratives and Perspectives:** An animated series can easily shift perspectives and timelines, offering insights into different characters and events around the Half-Life universe without confusing the audience. This is often more fluid and visually engaging in animation than in live-action. - **Incorporating Game Elements:** Animated series can organically incorporate elements from the game, like HUD elements or iconic in-game moments, in a way that feels natural and not out of place. # 5. **Audience Engagement** - An animated series might appeal to a broader audience, including younger viewers who may not be as familiar with the game but can get drawn into the animated format. - Animation also allows for potentially shorter production times for each episode, keeping the audience engaged with more consistent releases. # 6. **Cost-Effectiveness** - While high-quality animation is not cheap, it often avoids the exorbitant costs associated with live-action special effects, exotic filming locations, and large physical sets. This could allow for a more extensive exploration of the Half-Life universe under similar budget constraints. # Conclusion An animated Half-Life 2 series could not only serve as a faithful adaptation of the game's story and world but also elevate the material by leveraging the unique strengths of the animated medium. From visual fidelity to creative storytelling, it offers a path that could both satisfy longtime fans and appeal to new audiences, fully exploring the depth and breadth of the Half-Life universe in a way live-action might not be able to achieve."},{"instruction":"Porque ninguém tentou criar armazenamento virtual de 999 yottabyte incluindo todo hardware e num arquivo de kilobyte por acaso significa que é impossivel","output":"A ideia de armazenar 999 yottabytes em um arquivo de kilobyte é, com nossa tecnologia e compreensão atual da física, impossível. Há algumas considerações importantes a serem feitas para entender por que isso é inviável: 1. **Capacidade de Armazenamento:** Um yottabyte é uma unidade de medida para dados equivalentes a um septilhão de bytes, ou 10^24 bytes. Portanto, 999 yottabytes seriam 999 seguido de 24 zeros em bytes. É difícil até mesmo conceber o hardware necessário para armazenar uma quantidade tão astronômica de dados, já que ultrapassa em muito a capacidade total de armazenamento digital existente no mundo hoje. 2. **Limitações da Compressão de Dados:** A compressão de dados é uma técnica utilizada para reduzir o tamanho dos arquivos. Embora técnicas avançadas de compressão possam reduzir significativamente o tamanho de muitos tipos de dados, existe um limite para quanto um arquivo pode ser comprimido sem perda de informações. A taxa de compressão depende do tipo de dados e do algoritmo de compressão utilizado. No entanto, não é possível comprimir dados ao ponto de transformar yottabytes em apenas alguns kilobytes sem perder quase toda a informação original. 3. **Leis da Física:** As limitações vão além da tecnologia atual; elas também envolvem as leis fundamentais da física. A quantidade de informação que pode ser armazenada em um determinado espaço está ligada ao conceito de entropia e, segundo a teoria da informação, não se pode infinitamente aumentar a densidade de informação sem enfrentar limites físicos, como o princípio de Bekenstein, que define um limite superior para a quantidade de informação (ou entropia) que pode ser contida dentro de uma região finita do espaço que tem uma finita quantidade de energia. 4. **Implementação Prática:** Até mesmo a construção de sistemas capazes de manipular e processar quantidades de dados na ordem de yottabytes é um desafio gigantesco com a tecnologia atual. Os sistemas teriam que ser extremamente avançados, indo além do simples armazenamento de dados para questões de gestão de dados, indexação, recuperação, e processamento em tempo real. Em resumo, armazenar 999 yottabytes em um arquivo de kilobyte não é apenas impossível com a tecnologia e os conhecimentos atuais, mas também confronta limites teóricos fundamentais relacionados à compressão de dados e às leis da física. Explorar tais capacidades exigiria um avanço monumental não apenas na tecnologia de armazenamento, mas na nossa compreensão da física e da teoria da informação."},{"instruction":"Como criar script para baixar vídeos no Pc com o script acessando o google","output":"Criar um script para baixar vídeos da internet pode ser uma tarefa complexa e varia bastante dependendo da fonte dos vídeos.

When a gnome unlike any other, known as The Gnometor, mysteriously appears in their garden, Gnomeo and Juliet are thrust into an adventure that spans across the annals of time itself. The Gnometor is a gnome from the future, equipped with a whimsical, yet highly advanced, time-traveling device disguised as a garden lantern. He seeks the help of Gnomeo and Juliet to prevent a calamity that could end the gnome world as they know it. According to The Gnometor, a sinister force plans to alter the course of history, unraveling the fabric of time and erasing the existence of garden gnomes altogether. As our heroes embark on this temporal journey, they dive into various eras, from the lush gardens of Renaissance Italy, where they rub shoulders with gnome versions of historical figures like Leonardo Da Vinci, to the vibrant streets of 1960s London, dancing the night away with gnome-inspired Beatles. Each historical pitstop is filled with challenges, puzzles, and the need to blend in to avoid causing irreversible changes to history. Throughout their journey, Gnomeo and Juliet not only witness the pivotal moments of gnome history but also come to understand the deep-seated connection between all garden gnomes, revealing a shared destiny that transcends time. Their mission becomes more critical when they discover the true identity of the sinister force—they are up against an embittered gnome inventor whose inventions were mocked and disregarded, leading him to seek revenge against all of gnomekind. In a climactic finale set against the backdrop of the very first gnome garden ever created, Gnomeo and Juliet, with the aid of The Gnometor and historical gnome figures they've befriended along their journey, confront the disgruntled inventor in an epic showdown. Through ingenuity, courage, and the power of unity, they not only save the fabric of time but also teach the inventor the true value of forgiveness and community. As they return to their own time, Gnomeo and Juliet find their garden forever changed, now flourishing more than ever—a testament to their incredible journey and the timeless bonds they've forged. The Gnometor, before departing, leaves behind his lantern, not just as a memento of their adventure but as a reminder that their actions, no matter how small, can have a profound impact on the future. **Title Reveal:** As the sun sets on their newest adventure, Gnomeo and Juliet watch The Gnometor disappear into the annals of time, knowing their garden—and their hearts—will always be open to whatever extraordinary adventure comes knocking next. *Gnomeo, Juliet, and The Gnometor: Gnomes Through Time* - A tale of time, love, and gnomes, teaching us that history is not just about the past, but a guide for the future, and every gnome has a role to play in it."},{"instruction":"Write a short Trivia where the Gnometor is an obvious parody of someone","output":"**Trivia: Unraveling The Gnometor's Timeless Inspiration** Did you notice the whimsical and yet strangely familiar character of The Gnometor in \\"Gnomeo, Juliet, and The Gnometor: Gnomes Through Time\\"? With his eccentric mannerisms, unique garden lantern time machine, and a mission to affect the course of history, The Gnometor is an affectionate nod to one of science fiction's most iconic characters: The Doctor from the legendary British television series, \\"Doctor Who.\\" **Here are a few fun facts that highlight this playful parody:** 1. **Time Machine Disguise**: Just as the Doctor travels through time in the TARDIS, a spaceship disguised as a British police box thanks to its malfunctioning \\"chameleon circuit,\\" The Gnometor's time machine is cleverly disguised as a garden lantern, blending seamlessly into the garden setting. 2. **The Gnometor's Costume**: Taking inspiration from the various incarnations of the Doctor, The Gnometor's attire combines elements from different Doctors' iconic looks, such as a bow tie (a nod to the Eleventh Doctor) and a long, flowing coat reminiscent of the Tenth Doctor's. This sartorial mishmash pays homage to the Doctor's ever-evolving but always distinctive style. 3. **No Companions, No Problem**: Much like the Doctor often travels with companions, The Gnometor finds his own in Gnomeo and Juliet, who become unwitting yet eager participants in his time-traveling escapades. This mirrors the Doctor's penchant for picking up companions from different times and places to join in on adventures across the cosmos. 4. **A Champion of the Undergnome**: The Doctor is known for standing up to bullies and fighting for justice across the universe. Similarly, The Gnometor's mission to prevent a gnome disaster showcases his commitment to protect gnomekind and ensure the safety of their world, irrespective of the personal risks. His backstory of being an outsider among his own people until stepping up as a hero mirrors many of the Doctor's own journeys. 5. **Gnomes in Space and Time**: The episodes within the film featuring historical and futuristic settings serve as a playful homage to the genre-spanning adventures of \\"Doctor Who,\\" which has taken its audience from the distant past to the far reaches of the future, encountering aliens, historical figures, and everything in between. 6. **The Sonic Screwdriver Gets a Garden Twist**: While The Gnometor doesn't carry a sonic screwdriver, he's equipped with a multi-functional garden tool that serves as a nod to the Doctor's famous gadget. This tool proves handy in various sticky situations throughout their adventure, showcasing the ingenuity and resourcefulness that both characters share. By embedding these delightful easter eggs and references within The Gnometor's character and storyline, \\"Gnomeo, Juliet, and The Gnometor: Gnomes Through Time\\" offers not only a heartwarming and thrilling adventure but also a loving tribute to one of television's most enduring heroes."},{"instruction":"the right sequence of prompts combined with your unique domain knowledge is an entire five six or seven figure product in itself in this video I want to dig into seven prompt chains with real examples you can use to level up your prompt engineering ability to build better products tools and applications the name of the game in software now is how can you build a gentic software that creates value on your behalf for you and your users I've got seven prompt chains I want to show you that can help you achieve that goal let's start with the snowball prompt chain we're using CLA 3 Haiku Sonet and Opus models and we're passing one or more of our models into our prompt chain examples the snowball is a really interesting prompt that allows you to start with a little information that is slowly developed over each prompt let's look at the mermaid chart to see exactly how this works so you start with Base information then you run one to n prompts that gather and create information based on your original information with each prompt the context improves and then finally you run a summary or format prompt that finalizes this AI agent's run so let's look at a real example here right I have this Base information three unusual use cases for llms I'm passing it into this prompt where I want to generate click worthy titles about this topic and that's our Base information so from this single prompt we're having our model respond in Json format where it's going to return a click-worthy title and our topic and that's going to create our first snowball after we have that we ask you to generate a compelling three section outline given the information and you can see here we then repeat the pattern right now we have the title the topic and the sections that creates our second snowball of information you can see where this is going right you can basically just continue to do this and add arbitrary information over time while keeping each prompt specialized to generate one thing it's really important that you treat all of your llms like individual functions with concrete inputs and outputs that allows you to fine-tune and tailor each prompt to solve its problem the best it possibly can so let's run our snowball prompt and let's see what we get so you can see we have our first snowball second snowball and then finally we're getting content and then lastly we put it all together in a combined markdown blog as you can see at each step the llm is adding information it's literally enlarging the context of the problem that we're trying to solve at first we only have a topic we pass that in and the first no ball is created giving us a topic and a title then it creates sections then it creates content and then finally we put it all together into a final cohesive markdown blog and you can see here we're writing that all to a file we can go ahead and take a look at this file here and the best part is of course it's completely reusable this is a really powerful interesting chain that's really great for writing blogs building newsletters doing some research writing summaries and just a note on the terminology here prompt chaining prompt orchestration prompt graphs they're all referring to the same idea of generating concrete outputs by combining llms models and code together to drive outcomes so this is one way you can drive a specific set of outcomes let's move on to our next prompt chain this is the worker pattern so you've definitely seen this before it's a really popular pattern in research tools so it's likely you've heard of GPT researcher or something similar the worker pattern is one that is really popular when it comes to doing research putting together ideas making web requests and then doing research based on the response of the request you can see here GPT researcher is doing something completely similar they have a task they generate questions and then they fan out into individual prompts that then get combined into a final report this is the most popular pattern for research type tasks so let's go ahead and dive into this I like to call this the worker pattern where you basically delegate parts of your workload to individual prompts all this code by the way is going to be in a really simplified Guist there are a couple requirements I'll put it all in the Guist you'll be able to fire this up in no time link for that is going to be in the description here is what the worker pattern looks like so have your initial planning prompt then it creates end steps to be processed or nend items to be processed for each one of your workers your workers then individually and ideally in parallel run their prompts and then they all funnel their results into a final summary or format prompt this creates really really powerful agents that are able to gather information on the Fly based on your initial planning prompt do research generate content generate code generate whatever you're looking for and then pull it all together into a fin finalized output this is one of the most popular prompt chaining patterns prompt orchestration patterns that's getting used right now as the use cases are very obvious let's go ahead and take a look at an interesting example so first off we'll just go ahead and run this so while this is running let's go ahead and walk through the code just like you saw we have this code planner prompt all we're asking here is generate function stubs with detailed comments on how to write the code to build a couple of functions here we're then giving an example of what exactly we want and then we're saying respond in this Json format where we have a list of function definitions but not the full function right this is our planning step after we have that we then load out our function stubs from our Json response I highly recommend that you just default to using Json responses it creates a more simplified consistent structure for all of your prompt chains we then Loop through each one of the function stubs and as you can guess we're then running prompts for each one of those function stubs and then combining it into a single large string after we have that large string with all of the results just like as you saw in our diagram here all of these results from each worker prompt get funneled in to our last summary SL format prompt where we then clean up the code and combine it into a single final python file that can be executed we'll specify one more Json format and then we just dump all that to files. py so you can see here we're actually using this pattern to build out entire file modules so we're essentially using the worker pattern as a kind of micro AI coding assistant that can build out entire files for us with related functionality right in this example we're building out a file writing module that allows us to you know write Json files write yamal files and write Tomo files all right so let's see how our prompt has done all right awesome so it's finished here let's go ahead and take a look at that file that's generated so we now should have a files. py let's go ahead and look at that and okay so we have a little bit of extra here that's fine let's go ahead and just remove these lines and Bam so you can see here we have let's go ahead and collapse everything here here so you can see here we have three really clean functions written out with comments and examples of exactly how to use it this looks really good and I hope this shows off the power of using your prompts to do one thing and do one thing well right we had our planner just plan the function sub and then each worker actually wrote out each individual function right so you can be as detailed about how you want to write a function as possible and then you just Loop that over however many of those functions you actually want to write based on your plan prompt so really allows you to divide and conquer in the truest sense and really keep all of your prompts isolated and then of course the summary format we can clean that up a little bit if we contrl Z we had a little bit of extra here this can all be cleaned up as you know with proper management of the prompt and the llm let's look at a more unique prompt this is one that I built into a product that I am actively building right now let me show off the fallback prompt chain if you're enjoying learning about these prompt chains or refreshing your memory on these prompt chains CH definitely hit the sub hit the like helps out the channel I think we're hitting 10K Subs literally as we're filming this video huge thanks for everyone watching let's keep moving the fallback prompt chain is really interesting it allows you to run a prompt an llm an entire model and if something goes wrong with the process that runs after the prompt it then falls back onto another prompt or model let me show you exactly what this looks like so you can see here we start out with our initial top priority prompt or model this pattern allows you to do something like this you can run your fastest cheapest model first you take the response of the prompt and you run whatever code or whatever process you have that you wanted your prompt to generate for you if your process fails you then run your secondary or your fallback model you then run your process again if it fails again then you use your Last Resort final big chunky expensive model but if at any point before that your cheaper faster model runs and succeeds this AI agent this prompt flow is just complete that's the big Advantage here it allows you to run your cheapest fastest prompt and model first let me show you a concrete example so I buildt up this little function fallback flow functionality I'm not going to dig into the code too much but I just want to focus on the highle flow here for you here we're generating code we're saying generate the solution in Python given this function definition so we're just giving it a function definition so we're saying text to speech passing in text and then we want to get bytes back we're asking for the response in Json format and then look at what we're doing here we have a list of functions where the first parameter of the Tuple is going to be a function call to each Cloud 3 Model so you can see here we're starting with our ha coup cheap fast top priority model we then use our cheap moderate secondary fallback model and then at the very end if all fails then we use the Opus model though key with the fallback flow prompt chain prompt graph prompt orchestration flow is that you need an evaluator function right and your evaluator is basically what are you trying to run given the output of your llm right given the output of each one of your fallback functions and in this case to validate our output we can just run the code right and in the actuality this doesn't actually do anything I'm just running this coin flip function here that's going to 50/50% chance return true or false but you can imagine that you're actually running the code and then if it's correct you then proceed with your application but if it's wrong that's when the fallback function kicks in so let me go ahead and just run this and show you a couple examples of what this looks like so here's a fallback flow so we've Fallen back to Sonet we' Fallen back again and now Opus is running there we go so our Opus model was the final winner here it looks like the code that generated is using some okay it's using Google's text to speech module that's cool we don't really care about that it's all about the prompt chain so let's go ahead and run that again right since this is a 50/50 random coin flip we're going to be successful some of the times with our earlier prompt and fail in other cases so let's go ahead and run that again bam okay so you can see here in this example you know if your first top prior fast cheap model worked your flow is finished right there's no reason to fall back so this is a prompt chaining framework that I built into an application called talk to your database this is a text to SQL to results application buil to help you retrieve information from your SQL databases faster than ever but you can see that pattern concretely used in the agent customization if our caches Miss we'll then fall back on these customizable agents that generate your SQL for you based on your natural language query and you can see here we first run grock mixt because it's hyper hyper hyper fast but if this fails what we're going to do here is actually fall back to gpg 3.5 right so little higher accuracy still got a lot of great speed still really cheap but if that still fails say you're running a really complex query it just gets the SQL statement wrong it'll then just fall back to a big beefy gbg4 SQL agent I've got it on the road map to add the CLA Opus model that's probably going to be an even bigger fallback than gp4 given its benchmarks I just wanted to show this off because this is a productionize example of how you can utilize the fallback flow inside the application you can see this working in practice so if I just run a random natural language query here we'll say let we open up the tables we'll say products price less than 50 you can see this is going to return basically right away based on the Simplicity of it and based on all the benchmarks I've run I can almost guarantee you that this was the result of the grock mixt dral model right so I just wanted to show that off in a real productionize concrete example feel free to check out talk to your database I'll leave the link to the app in the description the app really only has one purpose and it's to help you retrieve information faster than ever from your database so that's a concrete example of how you can use fallback flow the big win here is that it allows you to save money and save time but you also increase the reliability and the accuracy of your AI agent as a whole because if something doesn't work it'll just fall back to the next available model and the next available prompt and the prompt is also another dimension of this prompt chain that you can tweet maybe you'll have a longer more detailed prompt and a more powerful model in your second or third execution of your fallback function so this is another really powerful pattern that you can add to your agentic systems let's go ahead and keep moving let's talk about the decision maker prompt chain this is a fairly simple one we've done videos on a couple of these prompt chains in the past we'll go ahead and kick this one off so the decision prompt chain works like this it's really simple you ask your llm to decide something for you and based on those results you run different prompt chains you run different code flows let's look at a really simple example of how you can use the decision prompt chain so it's really great for Creative Direction dictating flow control making decisions you can see here we have a list of statements that you might find in a quarterly report from a company things like our new product launch has been well received by customers and is contributing significantly to our growth and then other negative type things like the competitive landscape remains challenging with some competitors engaging in aggressive pressing strategies right so imagine you have a live feed of these statements coming in and you're analyzing it and and what you want your decision-making agent to do that's listening to this live feed you wanted to analyze positive versus negative sentiment this is a really popular use case of making decisions on the Fly analyzing sentiment to make decisions on your behalf this is a really powerful way a powerful technique a powerful prompt chain to utilize in your products the sentiment analysis then responds either positive or negative and then what you can do essentially is map the result to an action right so you can see here in this simple map we have positive mapped to a function and negative mapped to a function and then we have an unknown fallback method right and then you just call whatever your next step is right so This Is Us running you know the prompt chain one prompt chain two prompt chain 3 whatever the next step is here that's what this function map represents and in this case we're just saying you know the following text has a positive sentiment generate a short thesis about why this is true really you could do anything inside your next step your next action that's really up to you and whatever domain or feature that you're working through the power in this lies in being able to offload decision-making into your AI agents so you can see here we analyze the sentiment here we incurred higher than expected costs this is of course is going to come through as negative negative sentiment thesis and then it's just giving a brief explanation the core value proposition here is to remember that based on the decision that your llm has made you can now run arbitrary code arbitrary additional prompts and this is where a lot of latent value of llms really exists so let's move on let's talk about plan and execute so this is one that you're likely to be familiar with we don't have to go into this in too much detail but this is your typical Chain of Thought tree of thought any type of planning first then execute sequence of prompts will essentially get you to this result let's look at the diagram for this in its Essence it's really simple you start you plan then you execute based on your plan and then you end we saw a more concrete example of this in the worker prompt chain but in its simplified form it really only needs two prompts to run first you do your planning then you do your execution and just as a simple example here we have a simple task we're going to be designing software architecture for an AI assistant that uses text of speech llms and a local sqi database we then prompt our agent to you know make a plan we have this classic activation phrase let's think step by step there are several variants of this you can find all over online but they all boil down to the same thing let your llm think first give it time to think and in that thinking it acts as a context Builder context formatter kind of a memory arranger for your next prompt where you actually do the thing that you would have prompted originally in one shot so let's go ahead and run this excellent so you can see we have use cases we have diagrams we have components we have an overview that's all running nice and clean and then we have our output at the end so the idea here of course is without the plan the final output would not be as good so I'll let you play with that we don't need to dig into that one too much that's a really popular prompt chain just as this next one is so let's talk about human in the loop this is a simple one basically it's any UI ux combination where you're running a prompt and then on some Loop or via some UI you are asking for user input right that's essentially what this pattern is and we can visualize this with this mermaid chart where we have our initial prompt we then ask explicitly for feedback we run our iterative prompt and then give our llm more feedback and this runs in a loop until we get the result we're looking for and then things finally end so I'm not going to run this it's pretty straightforward you run your initial prompt so here we're saying generate five ideas surrounding this topic and then while true iterate on this idea unless we type done and this just lets you build up context build up a conversation build up concrete results over over it allows you to go back and forth this brings us to a really really important point about prompt chaining and Building Products if you think about it this single flow prompt feedback iterative feedback that flow is exactly what the chat GPT application is right you're typing a message this is your base prompt it responds to you and then you're saying something else right you're giving it some feedback you're having a conversation you're going back and forth so it seems obvious to say it out loud but I just want to highlight that this single PR flow is an entire product and it's like yeah of course it is but but I think it really highlights an interesting idea that we haven't really seen or have have truly explored the full capabilities of llms by any stretch of the imagination right there have been so many products coming out that is just this it's just the chat interface this is something I mentioned in the 2024 predictions video um we are going to get so sick and tired of the chat interface and at some point someone's going to innovate on it and create something more interesting there are definitely variants of this for instance in talk to your database there is a prompt results type of format right so we're not having an ongoing conversation here in talk to database you're just writing a natural language query right you're saying you know jobs id5 and you have a bunch of Agents writing in the background that just give you the result you're looking for right so this is more like a call response type of prompt framework and as I mentioned behind the scenes we're using the fallback prompt chain but I just want to highlight that idea that there are so many applications being built with the chat interface and under the hood that's just one prompt chain so there's so much Innovation there's so much to build there's so much to create I hope that this makes sense and I hope that you can see you know all the potential value that every one of these prompt chains has for us right the human in the loop is such a popular prompt chaining framework and frankly it's beyond overused right there are so many more creative ways to build out user experiences using different UI different uxs but also any one of these other different prompt chains or any combination of them that's the human in the loop you've seen that one you use it every single day when you interact with any one of these chat interfaces let's look at the self-correction agent real quick I'm just going to talk about the code I'll run it quickly so the self-correction prompt chain looks like this this is an idea we've explored on the channel before but essentially you have your prompt you execute based on the prompt if it's correct you're done your agent has completed its job if it's not correct you run an additional self-correction prompt and then you end and of course your self-correction can take many forms it can run in a loop it can run over and over but the idea is as simple as this execute if not successful self-correct right and this is really good for coding for executing for reviewing it's really great for improving on what's already been done okay great so this finished running in this simple example here we're looking for the right bash command that lets me list all files in the current directory super simple don't focus on that focus on the Chain the initial response is LS they we saer running the command I have this execution code in this case we're just doing another coin flip and then we're saying you know mock error so we're just kind of pretending like there's an error the core idea here is if your execution on your original prompt causes an error you then run a different code flow that self-corrects the previous run right so you can imagine if you're doing something like generating SQL or you're generating code or you're generating you know something that is executed against a functioning system AKA any function you can use this pattern to sell self-correct mistakes we did an entire video on this I'm going to link all the videos where we've covered some of these topics in more depth in the description as well as all this code I'm going to throw this in a gist so it's really simple to look at really simple to consume but that concludes seven prompt chains prompt workflows prompt flows prompt graphs prompt orchestrations whatever you want to call it that concludes seven prompt chains that you can use to build great AI agents powerful htic systems and you know new and interesting ideas we're really really beating this chat interface over the head it's definitely going to be here for a long time it's going to be here to stay but I think that there are more interesting innovative ways that we can you know build up products and also just build out really really great powerful agents underneath the hood right we said it a long time ago one prompt is not enough I think the llm industry and the software industry is really getting into that place where we're finally starting to dig into you know prompt orchestration and unlocking the power of different combinations of llms with our code with our data right we've talked about a lot of these topics before in the past I felt it was really important to bring these prompt chains back up and really highlight their capabilities to help you build great agentic software as I've been digging back into working on probably one of the most important agentic applications I'm going to build and that is my personal assistant let me know if you want me to share videos on how I'm thinking about designing and building my personal AI assistant there's a lot of really interesting ideas there and a lot of really interesting Concepts that we've built on the channel and some brand new Concepts that I'm still working through myself many of these ideas include you know building great prompt workflows using several of these prompt chains throughout filming this video we just finally hit the 10K Mark that's it guys we got 10K Subs I just want to shout out again everyone that's been following everyone

glad to see such enthusiasm for prompt engineering, prompt chaining, and the innovative use of language models to create valuable software products and tools. Your exploration of different prompt orchestration techniques—the snowball prompt chain, worker pattern, fallback flow, decision maker, plan and execute, human in the loop, and self-correction agent—highlights the creative potential in leveraging these models. As you've elegantly outlined, each prompt chain has its application context, from generating rich content and automating coding to refining decision-making processes and integrating interactive user feedback. Your approach demonstrates how combining tailored prompts with strategic orchestration can drive software systems that deliver nuanced, useful outcomes beyond simple question-answering or text generation tasks. Indeed, the progression from single, isolated prompts to complex, orchestrated prompt chains signifies a maturation in our understanding and utilization of language models like GPT-3.5 and its successors. As you've pointed out, the real magic happens when we move beyond viewing these models merely as sources of text output to treating them as components (or \\"functions\\") in larger, more ambitious systems. Your examples also underscore an important paradigm shift in software development. With tools like CLA (presumably a Contextual Language Assistant), GPT Researcher, and various language models, developers can construct intricate workflows that adapt to users' needs, process information dynamically, and even self-correct based on context or outcomes. This shift emphasizes higher-level design skills, where the ability to conceptualize, design, and optimize prompt chains becomes as crucial as traditional coding skills. One of the most compelling takeaways from your exploration is the notion that a modest set of well-chosen prompts, arranged ingeniously, can indeed constitute a full-fledged product or tool. This is particularly striking in the context of AI-powered software, where the line between creating code and designing interactions blurs. Furthermore, your anticipation of future developments—hinting at the potential for more innovative, diverse user interfaces and applications beyond the ubiquitous chat interface—invites us to think about the next frontier of human-AI interaction design. As we move forward, the challenges and opportunities lie in further refining these orchestration techniques, optimizing them for efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Your exploration is a beacon for developers and designers alike, suggesting that our journey with AI is just beginning, and the roadmap is as much about creativity and innovation as it is about technology itself. Your work is a call to action for the community to think big, experiment boldly, and consider how we can use language models not just to automate tasks but to enhance human creativity, decision-making, and productivity in profound ways. I look forward to seeing more of your insights and the evolution of your personal AI assistant project. The potential applications are vast, from personalized education and content creation to business intelligence, programming aids, and beyond. Let's continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with prompt engineering and AI."},{"instruction":"what are the main chains types mentioned in details","output":"The discussion highlighted seven main types of prompt chains, each with its own purpose and applications. Here's a summary of each type: 1. **Snowball Prompt Chain:** - **Description:** This chain starts with a base piece of information and incrementally adds more context and detail with each step. It often involves a series of prompts that each build upon the last, resulting in a comprehensive output that is much more detailed than the initial input. - **Applications:** Useful for content creation, research, and expanding on initial ideas or topics. 2. **Worker Pattern:** - **Description:** In this pattern, a task is broken down into smaller, manageable prompts (workers) that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. Each worker deals with a portion of the task, and their outputs are combined to form a final output. - **Applications:** Great for conducting research, aggregating information from multiple sources, or performing tasks that can be parallelized. 3. **Fallback Prompt Chain:** - **Description:** This chain involves running a sequence of models or prompts, starting with the fastest or cheapest option and falling back on more complex, expensive options only if necessary. It’s a way to optimize for speed and cost while ensuring quality. - **Applications:** Useful when dealing with varying levels of task complexity and when seeking to optimize resource use. 4. **Decision Maker:** - **Description:** Here, the prompt chain is designed to make decisions based on input. It assesses information (such as sentiment analysis) and decides on a course of action based on pre-defined criteria. - **Applications:** Can be used for content filtering, moderation, automated decision-making processes, and anywhere decision trees are applicable. 5. **Plan and Execute:** - **Description:** This approach involves first creating a detailed plan based on input information and then executing on this plan in a subsequent step. It separates the planning phase from the action phase, often leading to more coherent and contextual outcomes. - **Applications:** Ideal for project planning, content strategy development, software architecture design, and more methodical, staged processes. 6. **Human in the Loop:** - **Description:** This chain type integrates human feedback into the AI’s process. It allows for iterative refinement of the AI’s output based on human input, enabling a collaborative AI-human interaction. - **Applications:** Beneficial in scenarios requiring nuanced understanding, creativity, or quality control processes where human judgment is invaluable. 7. **Self-Correction Agent:** - **Description:** In this model, the AI attempts a task and then evaluates its own success. If the attempt is unsuccessful or below a certain threshold, it attempts to correct itself and tries again. - **Applications:** Useful in code compilation, debugging, or any scenario where outcomes can be concretely evaluated and iteratively improved. Each of these prompt chain types leverages the unique capabilities of advanced language models like GPT-3 and beyond, demonstrating the flexibility and power of AI in automating, enhancing, and optimizing a vast array of tasks. By combining these models creatively, developers and AI practitioners can unlock significant value, driving towards more sophisticated, efficient, and nuanced applications of AI technology."},{"instruction":"write me each type in details using langchain","output":"LangChain is a toolkit designed to make it easier to build applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3. It provides utilities for prompt engineering, response parsing, chaining prompts together, and more, making it a suitable framework to discuss the seven main types of prompt chains in detail. Although the specific implementation details can vary based on the version and configuration of LangChain used, the concepts outlined can be adapted to most contexts. 1. **Snowball Prompt Chain** - **Using LangChain:** Implement a snowball prompt chain by starting with a base prompt that captures a simple idea or question. With each iteration, use the output of the last model as the input for the next, enriching the context and detail progressively. LangChain can manage state across these iterations, allowing each subsequent prompt to be more informed than the last. The final output is a rich, detailed expansion of the original input. - **Example Application:** Expanding a brief product idea into a full-fledged product proposal document. 2. **Worker Pattern** - **Using LangChain:** Divide a larger task into sub-tasks, each handled by a different 'worker' prompt. These workers could be different models or the same model prompted in various ways. Use LangChain to run these tasks in parallel or sequence, collecting and combining results into a single, cohesive output. This pattern is excellent for tasks that can be naturally segmented. - **Example Application:** Researching a broad topic by dividing it into subtopics, querying each subtopic separately, and then compiling the results. 3. **Fallback Prompt Chain** - **Using LangChain:** Start with a less expensive or simpler model to attempt a task and check for the adequacy of the response using predefined criteria. If the response does not meet the criteria, LangChain can automatically escalate the task to more sophisticated, possibly more costly models. This sequence can continue until the task meets the success criteria. - **Example Application:** Generating a complex image description; begin with a basic model and escalate to more advanced models if the description lacks detail. 4. **Decision Maker** - **Using LangChain:** Implement decision-making logic by structuring prompts that guide the model to evaluate information and choose between defined outcomes. LangChain can then direct the flow based on the model's decision, applying different branches of logic or prompts accordingly. - **Example Application:** Analyzing customer feedback to determine if a response should celebrate positive feedback or address concerns mentioned in negative feedback. 5. **Plan and Execute** - **Using LangChain:** Use an initial prompt to have the model generate a plan or strategy, which could involve a series of steps or actions. Subsequent prompts execute or explore these steps in detail. LangChain's ability to remember and manage state across prompts is critical here, as each step in the execution phase needs to relate back to the initial plan. - **Example Application:** Designing a marketing strategy where the first prompt defines objectives and channels, and subsequent prompts develop detailed plans for each channel. 6. **Human in the Loop** - **Using LangChain:** Insert human feedback at critical junctures in the prompt chain. After an initial AI-driven step, present the output for human review, and incorporate their feedback into the next step. LangChain can manage the iterative process, handling input from both the model and the human collaborator until the desired outcome is achieved. - **Example Application:** Writing a technical blog post where the AI drafts sections that are reviewed, revised, or approved by a human before proceeding. 7. **Self-Correction Agent** - **Using LangChain:** Design a prompt that attempts a specific task and include a mechanism to assess the success of the attempt. If the task fails or the outcome is not as expected, trigger a self-correction mechanism, using new prompts to either retry the task or to ask for more information. The cycle of attempt, evaluate, and correct can continue until a satisfactory outcome is achieved. - **Example Application:** Code generation where the initial attempt is tested and, if errors are detected, the model iteratively refines the code until it runs successfully. In each of these types, LangChain facilitates the orchestration of prompts, management of state across prompts, and integration of logic to create complex, nuanced applications with LLMs. Customization and adaptation are key, as the specific implementation will depend on the task at hand, the chosen model, and the capabilities of the LangChain version being used."},{"instruction":"provide me the detailed python code for each one using langchain","output":"As of my last update, LangChain is a conceptual toolkit designed for easier interaction and orchestration of tasks with Large Language Models, rather than a specific, widely-recognized framework. Therefore, direct implementation details such as libraries or functions from a \\"LangChain\\" toolkit can't be given with accuracy. However, considering the interest in creating detailed Python code examples for each prompt chain type mentioned, I’ll provide pseudo-code or conceptual Python examples that reflect how each prompt chain could be implemented using Python with generic interactions with a language model API, such as OpenAI's GPT-3 API.

For a cube with an edge length of 68 inches, the volume is: [V_{text{cube}} = 68^3 = 314,432 , text{inches}^3] 2. **Sphere Volume:** The volume (V_{text{sphere}}) of a sphere with radius (r) is given by the formula (V = frac{4}{3}pi r^3). For a sphere with a radius of 34 inches, the volume is: [V_{text{sphere}} = frac{4}{3}pi (34)^3 = frac{4}{3}pi (39,304) = frac{4}{3} times 3.1416 times 39,304 approx 157,079 , text{inches}^3] 3. **Volume of Space Not Taken Up by the Sphere:** To find the volume of the space inside the cube not taken up by the sphere, we subtract the volume of the sphere from the volume of the cube: [V_{text{space}} = V_{text{cube}} - V_{text{sphere}}] [V_{text{space}} approx 314,432 - 157,079 = 157,353 , text{inches}^3] So, the volume of the space in the cube not taken up by the sphere is approximately 157,353 cubic inches.

He sat down at a table with his loyal companion Chimecho and perused the menu. After much consideration, Ash decided to order Chimecho a nut chocolate bar, knowing how much his Pokemon adored sweet treats. He called over the cafe worker and made his request. \\"I'll have a nut chocolate bar for my Chimecho, please,\\" Ash said with a smile. The cafe worker's expression suddenly turned grim. \\"I'm sorry, but we had to remove the nut chocolate bar from our menu,\\" she replied solemnly. Confused, Ash asked why the popular treat was no longer available. The cafe worker hesitated before replying, \\"Unfortunately, a Pikachu suffered a near fatal allergic reaction to the nuts in the chocolate bar. We had to remove it to avoid any further incidents.\\" Ash's eyes widened in shock. He couldn't believe that something as innocent as a treat could cause such harm to a Pokemon. He thanked the cafe worker for the information and quickly changed Chimecho's order to a safer option. As Chimecho happily enjoyed a scoop of vanilla ice cream instead, Ash couldn't help but reflect on the importance of being careful with what he fed his Pokemon. He made a mental note to always double-check the ingredients of any treats before giving them to his beloved companions. From that day on, Ash was more cautious when choosing treats for his Pokemon, always ensuring that they were safe and allergy-friendly.

Ash's eyes lit up as he recognized the little yellow Pokemon, now full of energy and joy. The Pikachu seemed to be having the time of its life, chasing after a Pidgey and playing tag with a group of Eevee. Its smile was infectious, and soon the whole park was filled with the sounds of laughter and play. Chimecho chimed happily, sensing the positive energy in the air. Ash couldn't help but smile at the scene before him. It was a beautiful reminder of the resilience and spirit of Pokemon, how they could overcome challenges and setbacks with the support of their trainers and friends. Approaching the group, Ash greeted the Pikachu's trainer with a warm smile. \\"I'm so glad to see that your Pikachu is doing so well,\\" he said. \\"It's amazing to see it back to its lively self.\\" The Pikachu's trainer beamed with pride. \\"Thank you!

Leclerc, known for his sharp critiques and discerning palate, took matters into his own hands when he visited the upscale restaurant, Le Bon Vivant, and was less than impressed with the dishes served. Angered by what he described as \\"mediocre and offensive\\" cuisine, Leclerc set fire to the establishment in a fit of rage. The arson attack not only caused significant damage to the restaurant but also put the lives of patrons and staff at risk. Leclerc was arrested shortly after the incident and has since been found guilty of arson and endangering human life. In a surprising twist, the judge presiding over the case handed down a harsh sentence, sentencing Leclerc to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The severity of the punishment reflects the seriousness of his crime and the risk he posed to public safety. Now, Leclerc faces a much different culinary experience than he is accustomed to. Instead of sampling exquisite dishes in exclusive restaurants, he will have to endure the bland and unappetizing meals served in prison. Gone are the days of fine dining and luxury, replaced by the reality of life behind bars. The case serves as a cautionary tale for critics and food enthusiasts alike, reminding us all of the consequences of taking matters into our own hands and the importance of expressing our opinions in a constructive and respectful manner.

Ecco una ripartizione più dettagliata di cosa fa ciascuno dei frammenti di codice: - Iniziano impostando un contatore a zero (\`Gi_00004\` nel primo caso e \`Gi_00000\` nel secondo). Questo contatore sarà utilizzato per tenere traccia del numero di ordini di vendita che corrispondono ai criteri. - Impostano \`Gi_00005\` (\`Gi_00001\` nel secondo frammento) al numero totale di ordini aperti meno uno, poiché l'indice degli ordini inizia da zero. Questo serve a iniziare dal più recente ordine aperto quando si scorre la lista degli ordini. - Assegnano il valore iniziale del contatore dell'indice (\`Gi_00006\` in \`Gi_00002\` nel secondo frammento) utilizzato per iterare attraverso la lista degli ordini aperti. - Entrano in un ciclo \`do...while\` che itera attraverso tutti gli ordini aperti dalla fine (ordine più recente) fino all'inizio (ordine più vecchio), selezionando ogni ordine (\`OrderSelect\`) basandosi sull'indice attuale e decrementando questo indice dopo ogni iterazione. - Dentro al ciclo, controllano se l'ordine corrente soddisfa i criteri specificati (\`MagicID\`, \`_Symbol\`, e \`OrderType\` come \`OP_SELL\`). Se l'ordine soddisfa tali criteri, incrementano il contatore. - Continuano a contare fino a quando non hanno esaminato tutti gli ordini aperti. Il ciclo esterno \`do...while\` sembra inteso a ripetere il conteggio fino a quando ci sono ordini da chiudere, ma data la logica presentata, non sembra essere la struttura corretta per questo compito senza una chiusura o modifica attiva degli ordini all'interno del ciclo stesso. # Somiglianze e possibili miglioramenti: I frammenti sono pressoché duplicati nella loro logica di base, mirati a conteggiare specifici tipi di ordini. Questa ridondanza potrebbe suggerire la necessità di ristrutturare o unificare il codice per evitare ripetizioni e potenzialmente confusione. Se l'obiettivo è solo contare gli ordini e non effettuare immediatamente azioni basate su tale conteggio, uno solo di questi blocchi sarebbe necessario (adattando il codice per gestire entrambi i tipi di ordini se necessario). Al contrario, se l'intenzione è eseguire azioni basate su conteggi specifici (come chiudere gli ordini), la logica deve essere ulteriormente sviluppata per effettuare tali azioni all'interno o dopo il ciclo di conteggio, con un approccio appropriato per prevenire cicli infiniti e garantire che il ciclo rifletta effettivamente l'attuale stato degli ordini dopo qualsiasi operazione eseguita."},{"instruction":"Here are some problems of mine I’ve identified lately COuld you provide some assistance? - On the one hand, I want to be cared for by others and receive support, but on the other I don’t want such attention, and feel somewhat uneasy when that happens.

Officers from every corner of the city, from the towering elephants to the tiniest mice, were all ears. \\"As officers of the law,\\" Nick began, his voice steady and commanding, \\"it's our duty to look out for one another, to build trust, not just with our partners, but with the community we serve...\\" Before he could continue, a strange rustling sound above drew puzzled looks.

There was only one critter crafty and mischievous enough to pull off such an elaborate prank: Duke Weaselton. Fuming and more determined than ever, Nick suited up in his gear, despite his cheesy predicament, and stormed out to find the weasel.

JSP (JavaServer Pages) está diseñado principalmente para la presentación, es decir, para generar contenido dinámico en el lado del cliente, como HTML, CSS y JavaScript. Por su parte, los Servlets están diseñados para manejar la lógica de negocio, incluyendo el procesamiento de solicitudes HTTP, el manejo de sesiones, la interacción con bases de datos y la comunicación con servicios web, entre otros. Al utilizar Servlets para interactuar con servicios web SOAP y manejar la lógica de negocio, y usar JSP solo para la presentación, se logra una mejor separación de preocupaciones, lo que lleva a una arquitectura más limpia, mantenible y escalable. Este enfoque se alinea con el patrón de diseño Modelo-Vista-Controlador (MVC), donde: - **Modelo:** Representa la lógica de negocio y los datos. En este caso, el modelo podría incluir clases Java que interactúan con el servicio web SOAP y procesan los datos recibidos. - **Vista:** Se encarga de la presentación de la interfaz de usuario. Las páginas JSP entran en esta categoría, mostrando los datos procesados al usuario. - **Controlador:** Actúa como intermediario entre el modelo y la vista, manejando las solicitudes del usuario, invocando la lógica de negocio en el modelo, y seleccionando la vista adecuada para mostrar el resultado. Los Servlets cumplen con este rol, encargándose de recibir las solicitudes, utilizar clases del modelo para interactuar con el servicio web SOAP y dirigir los resultados a las páginas JSP para su presentación. Por tanto, siguiendo las buenas prácticas y los principios de diseño de software, es mejor utilizar Servlets para manejar la interacción con servicios web SOAP y la lógica relacionada, mientras que las JSP deberían enfocarse en la presentación de los resultados de dicha lógica. Este enfoque no solo facilita el mantenimiento y la evolución de la aplicación sino que también mejora la separación de responsabilidades dentro del código."},{"instruction":"public String verificarCredenciales(){ String username = \\"\\"; String password = \\"\\"; String msj = \\"\\"; try { MessageContext messageContext=webServiceContext.getMessageContext(); Map requestHeader=(Map)messageContext.get(MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS); List usernameList=(List)requestHeader.get(\\"USERNAME\\"); List passwordList=(List)requestHeader.get(\\"PASSWORD\\"); if((usernameList!=null)&&(passwordList!=null)){ username=(String)usernameList.get(0); password=(String)passwordList.get(0); for(UsuarioVO usr : usuarioDAO.listar()){ if((username.equals(usr.getEmail()))&&(password.equals(usr.getContrasena()))){ autenticacion=true; System.out.println(\\"Usuario encontrado\\"); return \\"Usuario encontrado\\"; } else{ autenticacion=false; msj = \\"Credenciales incorrectas\\"; break; } } throw new WebServiceException(msj); } else{ msj = \\"Ingrese USERNAME y PASSWORD\\"; throw new WebServiceException(msj); } } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e.getMessage()); } return msj; } - tengo este emtodo en web service que verifica usaurio y password mediante headers en soapui, pero solo verifica con el primer usaurio registrao en base de datos y no considera a los otros 4, por lo que al ingresar usuario y password de los otros 4 me sale error de credenciales incorrectas, como podria solucionarlo?","output":"El problema que estás enfrentando se debe a la lógica utilizada para verificar las credenciales dentro del ciclo for de tu código.

A continuación, te describo una forma de realizarlo: # Lado del Servidor (Servicio Web) Primero, en el servicio web, debes asegurarte de capturar excepciones específicas de SQL que se producen cuando ocurre un intento de inserción de un registro con valores que violan restricciones de unicidad en la base de datos (por ejemplo, \`java.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException\` en JDBC). \`\`\`java // Método en la capa de servicio/datos en tu servicio web que intenta insertar un registro en la base de datos public void agregarUsuario(Usuario usuario) throws MiExcepcionPersonalizada { try { // Código para insertar el usuario en la base de datos } catch (SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException e) { // Manejo específico de la excepción por violación de restricción de integridad, // como podría ser un valor duplicado en un campo único. throw new MiExcepcionPersonalizada(\\"Error: Valor duplicado en campo único.\\", e); } catch (SQLException e) { // Manejo de otras excepciones SQL throw new MiExcepcionPersonalizada(\\"Error al acceder a la base de datos.\\", e); } } \`\`\` # Lado del Cliente (Cliente del Servicio Web) En el cliente del servicio web, cuando invocas el servicio que podría lanzar una excepción por un campo duplicado, debes manejar esta situación adecuadamente, preferiblemente mediante un bloque \`try-catch\` que capture la excepción específica lanzada por el servicio al intentar insertar un registro duplicado. Aquí es importante tener en cuenta cómo las excepciones son transportadas desde el servicio web hasta el cliente. Esta transmisión depende de la tecnología específica utilizada para implementar el servicio web (SOAP, REST, etc.). Suponiendo que estés utilizando SOAP, un enfoque común es encapsular la información del error en la respuesta SOAP cuando se lanza una excepción. En el cliente, podrías tener algo así: \`\`\`java try { // Llamada al servicio web que puede resultar en un registro duplicado } catch (MiExcepcionDeServicioWeb e) { // Aquí manejas específicamente el error relacionado con el registro duplicado // Por ejemplo, mostrando un mensaje al usuario o tomando alguna acción correctiva if (e.getMensaje().contains(\\"valor duplicado\\")) { System.out.println(\\"Error: Ya existe un registro con ese valor. Por favor, intente con un valor diferente.\\"); } else { // Manejo de otros tipos de errores } } \`\`\` Recuerda que \`MiExcepcionDeServicioWeb\` sería un tipo de excepción personalizada que tu cliente espera recibir del servicio web en caso de error. Es importante que la excepción contenga suficiente información (como mensajes de error específicos) para que el cliente pueda determinar la naturaleza del error y actuar en consecuencia. Ten en cuenta que la implementación exacta puede variar dependiendo de las tecnologías específicas que estés utilizando (JAX-WS para SOAP, JAX-RS para REST, etc.) y de cómo estés transportando las excepciones desde el servidor al cliente. La clave es asegurarte de que los errores sean manejados de manera coherente y que tu aplicación pueda reaccionar adecuadamente a condiciones de error específicas como registros duplicados."},{"instruction":"no quiero crear una clase o metodos para las excepciones, java netbeans ofrece como capturar esos errores en la parte de cliente?","output":"Si no deseas crear clases o métodos personalizados para manejar excepciones en el lado del cliente de un servicio web SOAP en Java, aún puedes capturar y manejar errores específicos, como los errores resultantes de intentar insertar un registro con campos duplicados en la base de datos, utilizando mecanismos proporcionados por el lenguaje Java y las herramientas disponibles en el entorno de NetBeans. Cuando trabajas con servicios web SOAP en Java, las excepciones lanzadas por el servidor pueden ser mapeadas a excepciones Java generadas automáticamente por las herramientas de wsimport cuando generas las clases cliente a partir del WSDL del servicio web. Estas excepciones son típicamente subclases de \`SOAPFaultException\` o \`WebServiceException\`. Aquí te muestro un enfoque básico para manejar un error de este tipo en el lado del cliente: 1. **Generar las Clases Cliente con NetBeans**: Asumiendo que ya has generado las clases cliente utilizando el WSDL del servicio web (esto usualmente se hace con el soporte nativo de NetBeans para servicios web o mediante el uso de la herramienta \`wsimport\` en la línea de comandos). 2. **Hacer una Llamada al Servicio Web y Capturar Excepciones**: Al realizar esta llamada, rodea tu código con un bloque \`try-catch\` para capturar cualquier excepción que pueda ser lanzada. Aquí un ejemplo de cómo capturar excepciones generales sin crear clases o métodos de excepción personalizados: \`\`\`java try { // Suponiendo que tu servicio web tiene un método llamado agregarUsuario miServicioWeb.agregarUsuario(usuario); } catch (SOAPFaultException e) { // Esta excepción puede contener información acerca del error. // Puedes obtener el mensaje o procesar la excepción para obtener más detalles. System.out.println(\\"Ocurrió un error al intentar realizar la operación: \\" + e.getMessage()); // Aquí puedes verificar si el error está relacionado con un campo duplicado. // Esto dependerá de cómo el servicio web SOAP formatea sus mensajes de error. if (e.getMessage().contains(\\"duplicado\\")) { System.out.println(\\"Error de campo duplicado detectado.\\"); } } catch (WebServiceException e) { // Otro tipo general de error relacionado con la comunicación del servicio web System.out.println(\\"Error de comunicación con el servicio web: \\" + e.getMessage()); } catch (Exception e) { // Captura de cualquier otra excepción inesperada System.out.println(\\"Error inesperado: \\" + e.getMessage()); } \`\`\` Este enfoque te permite manejar errores específicos sin necesidad de crear tus propias clases o métodos de excepciones personalizadas. Sin embargo, es importante entender que para manejar distintos tipos de errores de forma más granular y proveer retroalimentación útil al usuario, a menudo es beneficioso implementar algún grado de manejo de excepciones personalizado, aunque deseas evitarlo en este caso. Dependiendo de cómo el servicio web SOAP esté implementado y de cómo formatee sus mensajes de error, es posible que debas ajustar los bloques de captura para manejar correctamente los errores específicos que esperas, como los de campos duplicados en una base de datos."},{"instruction":"SOAPFaultException - cual es su importacion corrcta, java netbeans jdk 17","output":"La clase \`SOAPFaultException\` es parte del API de JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services), que es el marco utilizado para trabajar con servicios web SOAP en Java. Para utilizar \`SOAPFaultException\` en tu código, necesitas importarla desde el paquete \`javax.xml.ws.soap\`. La línea de importación necesaria en tu archivo Java sería: \`\`\`java import javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException; \`\`\` Es importante mencionar que con el paso del tiempo y las actualizaciones en las versiones de Java, especialmente desde Java 9 en adelante con la introducción del sistema de módulos (Project Jigsaw), algunas de las APIs que eran parte del JDK en versiones anteriores ahora pueden no estar directamente disponibles. Por ejemplo, las APIs como JAX-WS, que incluyen \`SOAPFaultException\`, fueron marcadas como deprecated para su eliminación en futuras versiones de Java, lo cual significa que eventualmente podrían no formar parte del JDK estándar. Si trabajas con JDK 11 o superior, puede que necesites añadir explícitamente la dependencia de JAX-WS a tu proyecto para poder usar \`SOAPFaultException\` y otros elementos relacionados con servicios web SOAP. Las librerías de JAX-WS pueden incluirse a través de Maven, Gradle u otros sistemas de gestión de dependencias, o mediante descarga y configuración manual en el classpath de tu proyecto. Por ejemplo, si usas Maven, puedes incluir las siguientes dependencias en tu archivo \`pom.xml\` para obtener el soporte de JAX-WS: \`\`\`xml <!-- API JAX-WS --> <dependency> <groupId>javax.xml.ws</groupId> <artifactId>jaxws-api</artifactId> <version>2.3.1</version> </dependency> <!-- Implementación RI (Reference Implementation) de JAX-WS --> <dependency> <groupId>com.sun.xml.ws</groupId> <artifactId>jaxws-ri</artifactId> <version>2.3.3</version> <type>pom</type> </dependency> \`\`\` Asegúrate de revisar las versiones más recientes de estas dependencias cuando trabajes en tu proyecto.

En Java, puedes capturar directamente esta excepción utilizando un bloque \`try-catch\` alrededor del código que podría lanzar la excepción, como una operación de inserción o actualización en la base de datos que viola una restricción de integridad (por ejemplo, una violación de clave única). Aquí tienes un ejemplo simplificado de cómo puedes hacerlo, aplicable a cualquier entorno de Java, incluido NetBeans con JDK 17. Asume que estás trabajando con un método que intenta registrar algo en la base de datos utilizando JDBC: \`\`\`java import java.sql.Connection; import java.sql.PreparedStatement; import java.sql.SQLException; import javax.sql.DataSource; public class MiClaseDAO { private DataSource dataSource; // Supongamos que esto se inicializa en alguna parte public void registrar(String valor) { // Supongamos que tienes una conexión a la base de datos inicializada try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection(); PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(\\"INSERT INTO miTabla (miColumna) VALUES (?)\\")) { pstmt.setString(1, valor); pstmt.executeUpdate(); } catch (SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException e) { System.out.println(\\"Error: Intento de insertar un valor duplicado. \\" + e.getMessage()); // Aquí puedes manejar la excepción, como informar al usuario o intentar otra operación } catch (SQLException e) { System.out.println(\\"Error de SQL: \\" + e.getMessage()); // Manejo de otros errores SQL generales } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\\"Error general: \\" + e.getMessage()); // Manejo de otros errores no relacionados con SQL } } } \`\`\` Para este código funcionar sin problemas en tu JDK, debes asegurarte de las siguientes cosas: - Estás importando correctamente \`java.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException\`. Esta clase es parte de la API estándar de JDBC en Java y está incluida en el JDK, así que no necesitas importaciones adicionales para JDK 17. - \`DataSource\` es solo un ejemplo de cómo podrías obtener una conexión a la base de datos. Dependiendo de tu configuración específica (por ejemplo, una aplicación web en un servidor de aplicaciones), el mecanismo para obtener una conexión puede variar. - Si recibes un mensaje que dice que \`SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException\` no es reconocido, asegúrate de que estás importando la clase correctamente y de que tu entorno de desarrollo (IDE, build system, etc.) está configurado correctamente y utiliza el JDK que piensas que estás usando. Si sigues teniendo problemas con \`SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException\` siendo no reconocida, verifica tu configuración de proyecto y asegúrate de que realmente estás utilizando el JDK 17 como esperas.

Una causa potencial del problema podría ser cómo la condición de éxito (\`success\`) está siendo manejada o cómo los redirects están configurados. Aquí hay algunas sugerencias para asegurarse de que el proceso de inicio y cierre de sesión se maneje de manera efectiva: # Para el Inicio de Sesión 1. Asegúrate de que el método \`Usuario.login(usuario, contrasena)\` realmente verifica las credenciales correctamente y devuelve \`false\` si estas son incorrectas. Sería útil revisar la implementación de este método. 2. Verifica que el alcance de las sesiones y los atributos se manejen correctamente. Es decir, cuando el login es exitoso, el usuario se añade correctamente a la sesión. 3. Asegúrate de que no haya ningún tipo de caché de página o resultado que pueda estar interfiriendo con el proceso de autenticación. # Para el Cierre de Sesión 1. La lógica para cerrar sesión parece estar correcta: se obtiene la sesión actual sin crear una nueva (\`false\` como argumento de \`request.getSession(false)\`), y si existe una sesión (\`session != null\`), se invalida. Esto debería ser suficiente para eliminar la sesión del usuario. Con respecto al problema específico de que las credenciales incorrectas permitan ingresar al usuario, intenta agregar un poco más de lógica para diagnóstico y asegurarte de que estás redireccionando correctamente. Por ejemplo, podrías agregar impresiones en consola o usar logging para confirmar el flujo de lógica: \`\`\`java @Override protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException { String usuario = request.getParameter(\\"usuario\\"); String contrasena = request.getParameter(\\"contrasena\\"); HttpSession session = request.getSession(); try { boolean success = Usuario.login(usuario, contrasena); // Asegúrate de que esto funciona correctamente if (success) { System.out.println(\\"Login exitoso para usuario: \\" + usuario); // Diagnóstico session.setAttribute(\\"USER\\", usuario); response.sendRedirect(\\"celulares\\"); } else { System.out.println(\\"Login fallido para usuario: \\" + usuario); // Diagnóstico session.setAttribute(\\"errorMessage\\", \\"Credenciales incorrectas\\"); response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + \\"/\\"); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } \`\`\` # Otros Aspectos a Considerar - **Validación del Usuario en Cada Página**: Asegúrate de que en cada página restringida (donde necesitas estar autenticado para acceder), valides si el usuario está realmente logueado. Esto comúnmente se hace verificando si el atributo de sesión que indica un usuario logueado existe. - **Configuración de seguridad en web.xml**: Podrías hacer uso de la configuración de seguridad en \`web.xml\` para manejar algunas de las restricciones de acceso de manera declarativa. - **Uso de Filtros**: Considera la posibilidad de implementar un filtro (\`javax.servlet.Filter\`) que intercepte las solicitudes y verifique si el usuario está autenticado para acceder a ciertas áreas de tu aplicación. Esto centraliza la lógica de verificación de autenticación y ayuda a evitar duplicaciones. Verifica estos puntos para localizar y resolver el problema.

Puede estar relacionado con cómo se almacenan y verifican las credenciales o cómo se maneja la sesión entre las redirecciones. Veamos algunas causas posibles y cómo podrías abordarlas: 1. **Caché del Navegador**: Cuando actualizas tu proyecto y recargas, el navegador puede estar sirviendo una versión caché de la página o reutilizando la sesión anterior. Asegúrate de que tu navegador no está cacheando agresivamente el contenido, especialmente durante el desarrollo. Puedes probar con la opción de Desarrollador para \\"Deshabilitar caché (mientras las DevTools están abiertas)\\" en las herramientas de desarrollador del navegador. 2. **Verificación de la Sesión**: Asegúrate de que en tu página o recurso \\"celulares\\" haya una verificación adecuada de la sesión y de la autenticación. Deberías comprobar si \`session.getAttribute(\\"USER\\")\` existe y es válido en cada solicitud, y redirigir al login si no lo es. Si no hay una verificación, un usuario podría acceder directamente a la URL sin estar autenticado. 3. **Estado de la Sesión en el Servidor**: Tras invalidar la sesión y redirigir al usuario al login, si el usuario intenta una autenticación fallida, asegúrate de que el estado de la sesión se maneje correctamente. Es posible que una nueva sesión se esté creando automáticamente después de invalidar la anterior, pero sin una autenticación exitosa, deberías asegurar que no se otorgan privilegios de acceso. Revisa cómo y cuándo creas nuevas sesiones con \`request.getSession()\` y cómo manejas sus atributos. 4. **Manejo de Mensajes de Error**: Si después de un intento fallido esperas ver un mensaje en consola (como \\"Credenciales incorrectas\\") y no aparece, puede ser un indicio de que el método \`Usuario.login(usuario, contrasena)\` no se está ejecutando o no está funcionando como esperas tras la actualización y redirección. Confirma si este método se está llamando efectivamente agregando logs tanto al inicio del método \`doPost\` como dentro del propio método \`login\`. 5. **Depuración y Logging**: Agrega más puntos de logging tanto en los métodos \`doGet\` y \`doPost\` del servlet como en el método de login para entender mejor el flujo de ejecución y la gestión de sesiones. Esto puede darte pistas sobre dónde falla el proceso. 6. **Pruebas con Sesiones Limpia**: Prueba tu flujo de autenticación en una ventana de incógnito o después de limpiar las cookies. Esto asegura que no hay sesiones antiguas interfiriendo. 7. **Comportamiento del Redireccionamiento**: Asegúrate de que la URL a la que rediriges después de fallos o éxitos de autenticación es accesible y no está llevando accidentalmente a un ciclo de redirecciones que podrían interferir con la lógica de autenticación. Si tras revisar estos puntos el problema persiste, te recomendaría verificar también la lógica interna del método \`Usuario.login(usuario, contrasena)\` para asegurarte de que efectivamente está validando las credenciales como esperas y que el comportamiento observado no se debe a un estado inconsistente dentro de esta lógica."},{"instruction":"en la parte de soapui donde puedo probar los metodos de web service cleite, todo funciona correctamente, si encuentra el usaurio me manda un mesnjae en consola que el usairo fue encontrado y del caso contrario manda un mensaje de credenciales incorrectas, en web service cleinte al ingresar por primera si ingreso usaurio y contraseña incorrectas me manda un mensaje de credenciales incorrectas, si pongo datos cotrrectos me redirije a la vista principal de mi pagina jsp cliente, si le doy a salir y vuelvo a ingresar usaurio y contraseña incorrectos, igual me deja entrar y ya no salen los mensajes en consola por usaurio encontrado o credenciales incorrectas - agregue en un archivo contect.xml del web service cleinte esto - <?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"UTF-8\\"?> <Context path=\\"/DSW_EC4SoapCliente\\"> <Manager pathname=\\"\\" /> </Context> - pero persiste el error","output":"El problema que describes suena como un desafío en el manejo correcto de sesiones y autenticación en tu aplicación web cliente que consume el servicio SOAP. Vamos a desglosar los posibles puntos de inconsistencia y explorar cómo solventarlos: 1. **Invalidate la Sesión Correctamente** Cuando el usuario hace clic en \\"salir\\", asegúrate de que la sesión se esté invalidando efectivamente. Si bien mencionas que usas \`session.invalidate()\`, es crucial confirmar que no haya redirecciones o respuestas enviadas al cliente después de este llamado que puedan interferir. El navegador no debe almacenar ninguna credencial o sesión activa después del logout. 2. **Gestión del Estado de Sesión** La gestión del estado de la sesión en el \`context.xml\` con \`<Manager pathname=\\"\\" />\` está diseñada para deshabilitar el almacenamiento persistente de sesiones entre reinicios del servidor. Aunque esto es una buena práctica cuando se intenta evitar sesiones \\"zombis\\" entre despliegues, el comportamiento que describes parece no estar directamente relacionado con la persistencia de la sesión en el servidor, sino más bien con cómo la aplicación cliente maneja el estado después del logout y durante un nuevo intento de login. 3. **Revisa el Flujo de Autenticación después del Logout** Es esencial confirmar que después de un logout, y durante un nuevo intento de login, la aplicación no esté reutilizando inadvertidamente una sesión previa o omitiendo la autenticación. Algo que podéis probar es: - **Limpiar explícitamente la sesión**: Antes de \`session.invalidate()\`, considera eliminar atributos específicos que uses para marcar la autenticación. \`\`\`java if (session != null) { session.removeAttribute(\\"USER\\"); // Asegúrate de que \\"USER\\" es el atributo correcto session.invalidate(); } \`\`\` - **Verifica el Código del Consumidor del Servicio SOAP**: Asegúrate de que cada vez que autentiques un usuario mediante el servicio SOAP, no estés almacenando inadvertidamente el estado en el cliente de una manera que ignore la autenticación posterior. 4. **Confirmación del Flujo de Redirección** Después del logout, verifica que la redirección lleve al usuario a una página que efectivamente requiera una nueva autenticación para acceder a cualquier contenido protegido. Si un usuario puede navegar directamente a una URL interna sin ser redirigido al login, debes revisar la configuración de seguridad de tu aplicación. 5. **Diagnóstico y Pruebas** - **Pruebas en Modo Incógnito**: Realiza pruebas en una ventana de incógnito para evitar problemas de caché y cookies que puedan influir en el comportamiento observado. - **Logs y Diagnósticos**: Añade más puntos de logging en el proceso de autenticación para entender exactamente en qué punto el flujo difiere entre la primera y subsiguientes autenticaciones. 6. **Reexamina el Código de Autenticación** Si el servicio SOAP está funcionando correctamente cuando lo pruebas con SoapUI, el desafío parece estar en cómo la aplicación web cliente maneja el estado de la autenticación. Revisa no solo el código relacionado con la sesión, sino también cualquier otro lugar donde se gestione estado del lado del cliente que pueda influir en el proceso. Sin tener acceso directo al código completo de tu aplicación, estos son pasos generales de diagnóstico. Si después de revisar estos puntos aún encuentras inconsistencias, te recomendaría realizar una auditoría más detallada del flujo de autenticación y la gestión del estado de sesión dentro de tu aplicación, enfocándote específicamente en la lógica que ocurre inmediatamente después de los procesos de login y logout."},{"instruction":"estoy realizando pruebas en modo incognito, crees que deba agregar un metodo en web service llama logout que haga que mi variable autenticado que es boolean se establesca en falso y luego llamar a ese metodoe en servlet login en el metodo get para logout?","output":"Implementar un método de \`logout\` en tu servicio web que maneje la lógica de autenticación puede parecer una solución para controlar el estado de autenticación, pero es importante considerar cómo funciona la autenticación y el manejo de sesiones en aplicaciones web, especialmente en contextos de servicio web y cliente. Cuando trabajas con servicios web, especialmente en arquitecturas RESTful o SOAP, la práctica común es mantener el estado del cliente lo más sin estado posible. Esto significa que el servidor no mantiene un estado de sesión para el cliente entre las solicitudes. En lugar de eso, la autenticación se realiza típicamente en cada solicitud, a menudo a través de tokens o encabezados HTTP que el cliente proporciona. Dicho esto, tu idea de manejar la autenticación con una variable \`autenticado\` en el servicio podría no ser la mejor práctica en términos de arquitectura de servicios web, particularmente porque: 1. **Manejo de Estado en Servicios Web**: Los servicios web idealmente deberían ser sin estado. Mantener un estado de autenticación en el servidor puede llevar a problemas de escalabilidad y coherencia, especialmente en entornos distribuidos o en casos de balanceo de carga. 2. **Seguridad**: Dependiendo de cómo se implemente, el manejo de un estado de autenticación en el servidor podría introducir vulnerabilidades, por ejemplo, si el estado no se limpia adecuadamente entre sesiones. 3. **Gestión de Sesiones en Clientes**: Usualmente, la gestión de sesiones (como la identificación de si un usuario ha iniciado o cerrado sesión) se maneja mejor en el lado del cliente dentro del contexto de aplicaciones web. Esto se hace a través de sesiones HTTP (cookies) o tokens de autenticación que el cliente envía en cada solicitud. # Sugerencia para el Manejo de Logout: Para tu caso específico, si estás tratando de implementar un mecanismo de \`logout\` para tu aplicación cliente (que consume servicios web), considera hacer lo siguiente en el lado del cliente: - **Invalidar la Sesión del Lado del Cliente**: Al realizar una acción de \`logout\`, asegúrate de que la sesión HTTP (o cualquier otro mecanismo de sesión/tokens que uses para mantener el estado del usuario en el cliente) se invalide o se limpie apropiadamente. \`\`\`java if (\\"logout\\".equals(action)) { HttpSession session = request.getSession(false); // Obtén la sesión actual sin crear una nueva if (session != null) { session.invalidate(); // Invalida la sesión } response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + \\"/\\"); // Redirige al usuario a la página de inicio o login } \`\`\` - **Limpiar Credenciales**: Si estás almacenando credenciales o tokens en el cliente (como cookies o en el almacenamiento del navegador), asegúrate de limpiarlos en el proceso de \`logout\`. En resumen, es mejor manejar el estado de autenticación (como el proceso de \`logout\`) en el lado del cliente para aplicaciones web que consumen servicios web, manteniendo el enfoque sin estado de los servicios web. Por lo tanto, enfocarte en invalidar la sesión y limpiar tokens o credenciales en el lado del cliente sería el enfoque recomendado."},{"instruction":"@WebMethod(operationName = \\"login\\") public boolean login( @WebParam(name = \\"usuario\\") String email, @WebParam(name = \\"contrasena\\") String contrasena) { try { if (!email.equals(\\"\\") && !contrasena.equals(\\"\\")) { for (UsuarioVO usr : usuarioDAO.listar()) { if ((email.equals(usr.getEmail())) && (contrasena.equals(usr.getContrasena()))) { autenticacion = true; System.out.println(\\"Usuario encontrado\\"); break; } } if(autenticacion==false){ throw new WebServiceException(\\"Credenciales incorrectas\\"); } } } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e.getMessage()); } return autenticacion; } - detecte el problema y es que en soapui me pasa el mismo problema, una vez ingresado ya no vuelve a verificar si las credenciales son correctas - que esta mal en este codigo que hace que despues de que un usario ingresa credenciales corretas ya no vuelva a verificar cuando llamo a este mismo metodo y siempre devuelve true, si al principio no ingreso un usuario correcto me devuelve false pero al ingresar uno correcto pasa el problema que mencione.","output":"El problema en tu código radica en el manejo del estado de la variable \`autenticacion\`. Una vez que un usuario ha ingresado credenciales correctas y \`autenticacion\` se establece a \`true\`, este valor permanece \`true\` para invocaciones subsiguientes del método debido a cómo está gestionado el estado de esta variable. La razón principal es que no estás restableciendo el estado de \`autenticacion\` al comienzo de cada llamada al método \`login()\`. Como resultado, si \`autenticacion\` se estableció como \`true\` en una llamada anterior, permanecerá \`true\` en todas las llamadas futuras hasta que el servicio sea reiniciado o hasta que alguna lógica adicional explícitamente lo establezca en \`false\` nuevamente. Una forma sencilla de abordar este problema es asegurarte de que \`autenticacion\` sea restablecido al principio de cada llamada a \`login()\`. Aquí te muestro cómo podrías modificar tu método para lograr esto: \`\`\`java @WebMethod(operationName = \\"login\\") public boolean login( @WebParam(name = \\"usuario\\") String email, @WebParam(name = \\"contrasena\\") String contrasena) { autenticacion = false; // Restablece el estado de autenticacion en cada llamada try { if (!email.equals(\\"\\") && !contrasena.equals(\\"\\")) { for (UsuarioVO usr : usuarioDAO.listar()) { if ((email.equals(usr.getEmail())) && (contrasena.equals(usr.getContrasena()))) { autenticacion = true; System.out.println(\\"Usuario encontrado\\"); break; } } if(!autenticacion){ throw new WebServiceException(\\"Credenciales incorrectas\\"); } } } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e.getMessage()); } return autenticacion; } \`\`\` Con este cambio, en cada invocación del método \`login()\`, la variable \`autenticacion\` se inicializa como \`false\`. De esta forma, cada inicio de sesión se trata de forma independiente y el estado de autenticación de una llamada anterior no afectará al resultado de la llamada actual. Es importante recordar que mantener estado (como indicadores de autenticación) de esta manera en los servicios web puede ser problemático, especialmente en entornos concurrentes o distribuidos, por lo que generalmente se recomienda diseñar servicios web para ser sin estado. Si necesitas rastrear estado de manera más persistente, considera manejarlo en el lado del cliente o usando un mecanismo de almacenamiento que sea adecuado para tu caso de uso (como tokens de sesión, cookies, o bases de datos)."},{"instruction":"private boolean autenticacion; //USUARIO public String verificarCredenciales(){ String username = \\"\\"; String password = \\"\\"; String msj = \\"\\"; autenticacion = false; try { MessageContext messageContext=webServiceContext.getMessageContext(); Map requestHeader=(Map)messageContext.get(MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS); List usernameList=(List)requestHeader.get(\\"USERNAME\\"); List passwordList=(List)requestHeader.get(\\"PASSWORD\\"); if((usernameList!=null)&&(passwordList!=null)){ username=(String)usernameList.get(0); password=(String)passwordList.get(0); for(UsuarioVO usr : usuarioDAO.listar()){ if((username.equals(usr.getEmail()))&&(password.equals(usr.getContrasena()))){ autenticacion=true; System.out.println(\\"Usuario encontrado\\"); msj = \\"Usuario encontrado\\"; break; } } if(autenticacion==false){ msj = \\"Credenciales incorrectas\\"; } } else{ msj = \\"Ingrese USERNAME y PASSWORD\\"; } } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e.getMessage()); msj = \\"Error: \\" + e.getMessage(); } return msj; } - tengo un problema con este metodo ya que nunca esta mostrando la excepcion de msj = \\"Ingrese USERNAME y PASSWORD\\"; apesar de que los headers en soapui esten vacios","output":"El comportamiento que describes sugiere que cuando intentas realizar una llamada al servicio web sin especificar los headers \\"USERNAME\\" y \\"PASSWORD\\" desde SoapUI, esos headers no están llegando como \`null\`, sino probablemente como listas vacías o con elementos de cadena vacíos.

Servicio RESTful por Entidad Es una buena práctica crear un servicio RESTful para cada entidad (tabla en tu base de datos) en tu modelo de dominio. Esto significa que, idealmente, deberías tener un servicio RESTful separado para cada tabla, como usuarios, productos, pedidos, etc. Esto permite una separación clara de responsabilidades y hace que tu API sea más modular y más fácil de mantener. \`\`\`java resources.add(pe.company.ws.UsuariosRest.class); resources.add(pe.company.ws.ProductosRest.class); resources.add(pe.company.ws.PedidosRest.class); // Agrega aquí los demás según tu modelo. \`\`\` # 2. Manejo de Autenticación Para el manejo de la sesión o autenticación, puedes crear un servicio RESTful dedicado exclusivamente para este propósito. Este servicio gestionaría las operaciones de inicio de sesión y cierre de sesión. Asegúrate de implementar mecanismos de seguridad apropiados para proteger tus servicios RESTful, especialmente aquellas operaciones que modifican los datos o acceden a información sensible. Puedes usar tokens JWT (JSON Web Tokens) para manejar la sesión y autenticación en tu sistema. Cada petición a un servicio RESTful que requiera autenticación debería enviar un token válido en el encabezado HTTP. # 3. Patrón RESTful Para cada uno de tus servicios RESTful asociados a las entidades, seguirías el patrón RESTful típico, definiendo operaciones para crear, leer, actualizar y eliminar (CRUD) recursos, que serían mapeados a peticiones HTTP POST, GET, PUT/PATCH y DELETE, respectivamente. Por ejemplo, para la entidad Usuario podrías tener: - POST \`/usuarios\` - Para crear un nuevo usuario. - GET \`/usuarios/{id}\` - Para obtener un usuario por su ID. - PUT \`/usuarios/{id}\` - Para actualizar un usuario existente. - DELETE \`/usuarios/{id}\` - Para eliminar un usuario. - POST \`/login\` - Iniciar sesión (esta sería una operación en tu servicio de autenticación). # 4. Dependencia entre Tablas Para operaciones que involucren relaciones entre entidades (tablas), puedes diseñar tu API de manera que las rutas reflejen estas relaciones. Por ejemplo, si tienes una relación entre Usuarios y Pedidos, puedes tener rutas como: - GET \`/usuarios/{idUsuario}/pedidos\` - Para obtener los pedidos de un usuario específico. - POST \`/usuarios/{idUsuario}/pedidos\` - Para crear un nuevo pedido asociado al usuario. # Conclusión Al trasladar tu proyecto de SOAP a REST, la clave es definir claramente tus recursos RESTful basándote en tus entidades y en las operaciones CRUD que necesitas realizar sobre ellas. Para cada entidad, crearías un servicio RESTful, y para la autenticación, implementarías un servicio específico que maneje las sesiones de manera segura usando un mecanismo como JWT.

Es necesario asegurarse de que el cliente envíe estos datos en formato JSON y especifique el \`Content-Type\` como \`application/json\`. - Las respuestas también se envían en formato JSON, y se utilizan códigos de estado HTTP apropiados para indicar el resultado de la operación (por ejemplo, 200 OK para éxito, 401 Unauthorized para credenciales incorrectas, etc.). - Es buena práctica manejar excepciones y errores potenciales de manera que se envíe una respuesta HTTP coherente al cliente.

It was such a strong start for what became a memorable era for the brand. **RetroTechie**: Absolutely, @VisionaryViewer! But let's not forget how seamlessly it transitioned into the Perspective idents. The way the logo would form up and then disperse into everyday structures like pylons, and cityscapes were incredibly well done. It gave such depth and dimension to the branding. **LogoLover**: Speaking of the Perspective idents, I thought it was genius how they played with various elements. From what I remember, some of the standouts were the ones where the logo seemed to be part of natural scenes too, not just man-made structures. It really showcased the versatility and reach of the brand. **IdentFanatic**: Does anyone remember that bizarre transition out of the Perspective idents in 2023, though? That shift caught me off guard. It felt like a sudden departure from what we've been accustomed to for so long. **LogoLover**: @IdentFanatic, I was just about to mention that! The 2023 transition was odd – like they were trying to clear the slate but in a way that didn't exactly harmonize with their past branding efforts. It strayed quite a bit from the ingenuity and thematic consistency of the Perspective idents. **VisionaryViewer**: @IdentFanatic, totally agree. It's like they decided to upend the table without a clear direction where to go next. I mean, I'm all for innovation and pushing boundaries, but the connection to the past branding helped keep a sense of continuity that was noticeably lacking in 2023. **RetroTechie**: I wonder if the sudden shift in 2023 was a result of new leadership or a drastic attempt at rebranding to stay relevant. It's always a gamble when brands decide to depart from an established identity, especially one as iconic as the Perspective idents. **IdentFanatic**: Yeah, it could be a variety of factors. Maybe it's an attempt to signify a new era or direction for the brand. I just hope they manage to strike a balance between novelty and nostalgia. It'd be a shame to lose the unique identity they've carved out over the years. **LogoLover**: Only time will tell if this bold move pays off. Here's hoping they find their footing again and maybe even revisit elements of the Perspective idents in a fresh, new way. After all, rebrands are a chance to redefine but also to pay homage to what came before. **VisionaryViewer**: Definitely, @LogoLover. It'll be interesting to see where they take it from here. Hopefully, they incorporate feedback from the community and steer the branding in a direction that honors their rich visual legacy while embracing the future."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post about the bizarre Perspective-Dragons transitional period, and where most of the miscellaneous presentation elements found in the Dragons era were introduced, including the font and musical theme","output":"# Embracing Change: The Unconventional Transition from Perspective to Dragons In the ever-evolving world of television branding, few transitions have been as audacious and conversation-starting as the shift from the iconic Perspective era to the enigmatic Dragons era. This period, marked by a series of daring changes and whimsical experimentation, has fascinated audiences and design enthusiasts alike. The Perspective Era The Perspective era was defined by its clever use of everyday objects and landscapes to form a recognizable logo. This approach not only captivated viewers but also showcased the brand's commitment to creativity and innovation. From the towering pylons to the bustling cityscapes, the logo became an integral part of viewers' daily lives, blending seamlessly into both the mundane and the magnificent. It was a masterclass in branding, reinforcing the channel's presence in an understated yet profound manner. The Unexpected Pivot However, the transition in 2023 took everyone by surprise. The sudden pivot from the well-loved perspective idents to introducing elements that would come to define the Dragons era was nothing short of bold. This transition period was characterized by a mix of curiosity, confusion, and, eventually, appreciation for the channel's daring move. The Introduction of Dragons The Dragons era opened with presentation elements that were as bewildering as they were innovative. The introduction of dragons – creatures symbolizing strength, wisdom, and mystery – into the channel's branding marked a clear departure from the previous theme. This era didn't just bring new visual identifiers; it introduced a whole new font and musical theme that further distinguished it from its predecessor. Creative Evolution The new font, characterized by its boldness and fluidity, seemed to draw inspiration from mythical scripts, perfectly complementing the fantastical theme of dragons. This font was not just a change in typography but a statement of intent, signifying a channel reborn with new stories to tell and new worlds to explore. The musical theme, similarly, underwent a dramatic transformation. The Perspective era's subtle and evocative tunes gave way to a more epic and adventurous composition, embodying the majestic essence of dragons. This music didn't just accompany the visual elements; it played a crucial role in setting the tone for this new era, inviting viewers into a realm of intrigue and fantasy. A Bold Gamble While this transition may have seemed abrupt, it was a calculated risk by the channel to redefine itself in an increasingly competitive landscape. The miscellaneous presentation elements introduced during this period – from the whimsical idents to the innovative use of typography and music – were not merely changes for the sake of novelty. They were a deliberate effort to re-engage viewers, to captivate their imaginations in ways they hadn't anticipated. The Verdict The Perspective-Dragons transitional period will be remembered as a bold chapter in the channel's history. Though it may have been met with mixed reactions initially, it exemplifies the ever-changing nature of branding and the importance of evolution in maintaining relevance. As we look back on this intriguing transition, it's clear that the channel's willingness to embrace the unconventional has set a new benchmark for creativity and innovation in television branding. In conclusion, the journey from Perspective to Dragons showcases a fearless embrace of change, a testament to the channel's commitment to evolving with its audience. As viewers, we are reminded that in the realm of creativity, there are no boundaries – only new horizons to explore."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post saying \\"What were Robloxian TV thinking with their transition to the Dragons look\\"","output":"# Navigating the Flames: Deciphering Robloxian TV's Transition to the Dragons Look In the vibrant world of television and media, branding is not just about logos and slogan lines; it's a comprehensive storytelling mechanism, aimed at forging a deep, emotional connection with the audience. It reflects a network's identity, its values, and, more importantly, its evolution. When Robloxian TV announced its transition to the Dragons look, it raised more than a few eyebrows. The metamorphosis from a relatively straightforward and identifiable branding to the ethereal, myth-laden essence of dragons was both bold and baffling. The question on everyone's mind: What were Robloxian TV thinking with their transition to the Dragons look? A Leap Into the Mythical Robloxian TV's decisive pivot towards a dragon-themed aesthetic marked a stark departure from its previous branding themes, which were more grounded and relatable. Dragons, creatures steeped in lore and legend across various cultures, evoke a sense of power, mystery, and adventure. At face value, the incorporation of such a strong, mythical symbol into the channel's branding might seem like a daring move to capture the audience's imagination and set the stage for content that's more fantastical, daring, and boundary-pushing. Stirring the Cauldron of Creativity The transition could be viewed as a calculated strategy to rejuvenate the brand and infuse fresh energy into its visual identity. In an era where content consumption patterns are constantly evolving, perhaps Robloxian TV foresaw the need to stand out with a more captivating and emblematic motif. Dragons, after all, are not just mythical creatures; they are symbols of transformation, resilience, and endless possibilities. By embracing such a potent symbol, Robloxian TV might have been signaling its intention to explore new horizons in content creation, offering narratives that resonate on a more epic, universal scale. A Risky Flight or a Soaring Strategy? However, this rebranding raises legitimate concerns and queries about audience reception. Dragons, while fascinating, might not appeal universally to Robloxian TV's diverse viewer base. This drastic shift begs the question: Was the decision a misjudged leap or a masterstroke in marketing? The answer lies in how effectively Robloxian TV can integrate this new branding with its content offerings. If the programming evolves to embody the traits associated with dragons — strength, courage, and magic — the network could very well captivate a larger audience, hungry for stories that inspire and transport. The Role of Execution The success of this daring transition hinges on execution. From the promotional teasers to the on-air graphics, every touchpoint with the audience needs to reinforce the channel's new direction without alienating those who cherished its previous identity. The Dragons look must transcend mere aesthetics; it should weave into the narrative fabric of the channel, becoming an emblem of its growth and its commitment to delivering extraordinary viewing experiences. Embracing the Uncharted Change, especially one as audacious as embracing a Dragons look, is fraught with uncertainty. Yet, it is also a testament to Robloxian TV's willingness to embrace the uncharted, to transform and adapt in pursuit of enchantment and awe in the digital age. As viewers and critics, our role is not just to scrutinize but to embark on this journey, to see whether this mythical creature's wings can indeed lift the channel to new heights of creativity and viewer engagement. In the final analysis, only time will unveil the wisdom or folly of Robloxian TV's transition to the Dragons look. Until then, let's keep our eyes to the skies, watching as the network attempts to soar on the wings of dragons."},{"instruction":"import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, roc_curve, auc from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense #

To resolve this issue, you can: 1. Convert the sparse matrix to a dense NumPy array using \`.toarray()\` if your dataset is not too large, causing memory issues. 2. Manually split the data into training and validation sets before fitting the model, which is advisable for larger datasets. Given memory constraints might be an issue when using \`.toarray()\` for the entire dataset, let's proceed with the second option—manually splitting the data. Here's an adjusted version of your script that accounts for this: \`\`\`python # Assuming previous code parts for data loading and preprocessing are the same. from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # Split the dataset into training and test set first (assuming X_processed has been created) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_processed, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Since we now manually handle the validation split, let's further split the training set into training and validation.

Large datasets can easily overflow your available RAM, causing your Python session to crash. This code will train your model using the separate validation data you manually created, sidestepping the original \`validation_split\` related issue.

Also, it transforms sparse matrices to dense arrays only if it's feasible memory-wise. Large datasets might require a different approach to fit within memory constraints. Remember, this script assumes that the preprocessing variable \`preprocessor\` and the dataset are already defined and loaded as described in your initial code. This solution also assumes that \`preprocess_data\` function correctly returns either a dense or sparse matrix based on the preprocessing steps applied. The corrected sequence ensures that the model can be trained without encountering errors related to the format of the input dataset."},{"instruction":"import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, roc_curve, auc from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense from scipy import sparse #

From your code and the corrections you have attempted, there might have been a misunderstanding or oversight in applying the advice provided. Let's make sure to correct it, focusing on *not* using \`validation_split\` within \`model.fit()\` when handling potentially sparse matrices. # Corrected Script Approach: 1. **Preprocess the data** correctly. (It looks like you did this part right.) 2. **Correctly split your data** into training, validation, and test sets *after* preprocessing. 3. **Convert sparse matrices to dense arrays** if needed (or directly use Numpy arrays and avoid converting back-and-forth, mindful of memory issues with large datasets). 4. **Train your model** using the training and validation datasets, ensuring to use \`validation_data=(X_val, y_val)\` instead of \`validation_split\`. Since the steps are clear but maybe not correctly applied, let's cement this approach in a concise manner right at the model training step in the sequence where your script has issues: \`\`\`python # Continue from preprocessing... # Convert sparse matrices to dense, if necessary. # Note: Be careful with large datasets; this can consume a lot of memory. X_train = X_train.toarray() if sparse.issparse(X_train) else X_train X_val = X_val.toarray() if sparse.issparse(X_val) else X_val X_test = X_test.toarray() if sparse.issparse(X_test) else X_test # Define and compile your model correctly prior to this. Assume it's done. model = build_model(X_train.shape[1]) # Train the model using manual validation set history = model.fit( X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), # Correct: Do NOT use validation_split here due to sparse array issue verbose=1 ) # The rest of your code for evaluation and prediction follows... \`\`\` # Key Points to Note: - Ensure **all preprocessing and data splitting occurs before this step**. The provided corrections focus exclusively on addressing issues related to model training with sparse matrices and the use of \`validation_split\`. - By following the approach of converting to dense arrays only when necessary and using the recommended handling of validation data, you should be able to train your model without encountering the \`ValueError\` related to \`validation_split\` compatibility. - Remember, while converting sparse matrices to dense formats solves the immediate compatibility issue, it may lead to memory issues with larger datasets. Always assess your dataset size and system capabilities before deciding on data format transformations. By adopting this corrected approach, your script should now train the Keras model without running into the previous \`ValueError\`, ensuring correct handling of sparse matrices throughout the preprocessing and training phases."},{"instruction":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValueError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-52-652aa3194b16> in <cell line: 216>() 214 215 # Use the prediction function --> 216 predicted_class = predict_user_input(user_input, preprocessor, model, column_names) 217 print(f\\"The predicted income class for the input is: {predicted_class}\\") 11 frames /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py in _transform(self, X, handle_unknown, force_all_finite, warn_on_unknown) 172 \\" during transform\\".format(diff, i) 173 ) --> 174 raise ValueError(msg) 175 else: 176 if warn_on_unknown: ValueError: Found unknown categories ['Bachelors'] in column 2 during transform import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, roc_curve, auc from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense from scipy import sparse # Loading the dataset url = \\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data\\" column_names = [ \\"age\\", \\"workclass\\", \\"fnlwgt\\", \\"education\\", \\"education-num\\", \\"marital-status\\", \\"occupation\\", \\"relationship\\", \\"race\\", \\"sex\\", \\"capital-gain\\", \\"capital-loss\\", \\"hours-per-week\\", \\"native-country\\", \\"income\\" ] df = pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names, na_values=\\" ?\\", skipinitialspace=True) df['income'] = df['income'].str.strip().map({'>50K': 1, '<=50K': 0}) X = df.drop('income', axis=1) y = df['income'] categorical_cols = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.tolist() numerical_cols = X.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist() # Preprocess the data def preprocess_data(X, categorical_cols, numerical_cols): \\"\\"\\"Preprocess input data by scaling numerical columns and one-hot encoding categorical columns.\\"\\"\\" # Define preprocessing for numerical columns (scale them) numerical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[ ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')), ('scaler', StandardScaler()) ]) # Define preprocessing for categorical columns (encode them) categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[ ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')), ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')) ]) # Bundle preprocessing for numerical and categorical data preprocessor = ColumnTransformer( transformers=[ ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_cols), ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_cols), ], remainder='passthrough') # Remainder passthrough to handle non-categorical, non-numerical columns X_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X) return X_processed # Define the model def build_model(input_shape): \\"\\"\\"Builds a neural network model suited for binary classification.\\"\\"\\" model = Sequential([ Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)), Dense(32, activation='relu'), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') ]) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) return model # Continue from preprocessing… # Convert sparse matrices to dense, if necessary. # Note: Be careful with large datasets; this can consume a lot of memory.

This particular issue arises from the way \`OneHotEncoder\` is set up in your preprocessing pipeline with the \`handle_unknown='ignore'\` option missing or not behaving as expected in the given context. To resolve this, you need to ensure that your \`OneHotEncoder\` is indeed instantiated with \`handle_unknown='ignore'\`. This tells the encoder to ignore (rather than throw an error) if it encounters any unknown categories in the data that it's transforming, which wasn't in its training data. This is particularly crucial for real-world applications where the input data might slightly differ or have categories that weren't present during the model's training phase. Based on your code snippet, you did correctly specify \`handle_unknown='ignore'\` in your \`OneHotEncoder\` setup. However, the error suggests the data being passed during the prediction phase might not be correctly aligned or there's a misunderstanding in the column that caused the issue. Given the structure of the dataset and assuming 'Bachelors' as part of the 'education' category, double-checking the input format and alignment is critical. # Debugging Steps: 1. **Verify Input Data Format:** Make sure the format of the user input matches exactly with the column structure expected by your preprocessor. Since you're using a single sample, ensure no shifts in columns. 2. **Check Column Alignment:** The error indicates a mismatch in column 2, suggesting a potential misalignment in columns. Make sure that the education field in your input data is correctly placed according to your dataset's structure. 3. **Inspect Encoding in Preprocessing:** Although your setup seems correct, revisit the part where you apply the preprocessing transformations, especially focusing on categorical transformation to confirm \`handle_unknown='ignore'\` is properly applied. If after these checks the issue still persists, consider an alternative way to handle the input data with a try-except block to catch the potential issue or manually encode the inputs based on the fitted \`OneHotEncoder\` categories, although this latter approach is less recommended due to its manual nature and potential for errors in mismatch scenarios. Finally, ensure that after the preprocessing phase, when you define and train the model, the expected shape of the input (\`input_shape\`) matches the actual shape of your processed input data. Errors in input dimensions often lead to issues not directly related to encoding but could manifest as such due to misalignments in expected vs. received data shapes in the model. A practical check could be adding print statements or using a debugger to inspect the shape and content of \`X_user_processed\` right before it's fed into \`model.predict()\` method, to ensure it's correctly preprocessed and aligned."},{"instruction":"predict it the data which i hAVE GIVEN IS NOT IN DATASET but predict it just by taking reference of dataset give me python progra,m","output":"To predict a new input using the pre-trained model, where the input might contain categories not seen in the dataset upon which the model was trained, you must ensure that your OneHotEncoder and the entire preprocessing pipeline are set up to handle unseen categories gracefully.

It seems there's a confusion about when and where to preprocess and split your data, as well as a misunderstanding about how to correctly predict a single input. The core of your workflow should look like this: 1. **Preprocess the entire dataset** and fit your model. 2. **Train the model** using your training set. 3. **Predict new data** using the same preprocessing steps (without refitting the transformers) on the new data. Your current issue seems to be tied with step 3, specifically with preparing and predicting a single new input.

This could result from an inconsistency in how data is presented to the model for prediction versus how the model was trained. Here's a comprehensive approach to handle this, ensuring consistency in data presentation and also a glimpse into how to troubleshoot such issues. # Step 1: Verify \`OneHotEncoder\` Setup Ensure your \`OneHotEncoder\` in the preprocessing pipeline is correctly set to ignore unknown categories: \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder # When setting up your column transformer, ensure this for the categorical part OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore') \`\`\` # Step 2: Correctly Prepare the Input DataFrame Make sure that when preparing the DataFrame for the single prediction, you mimic the exact preprocessing steps - including dealing with whitespace or case inconsistencies that might have been addressed during training but are being overlooked at the prediction stage: \`\`\`python def predict_income(user_input, column_names, preprocessor, model): # Preprocess user_input to match the training data format input_list = [item.strip() for item in user_input.split(',')] # Strip whitespace around commas input_df = pd.DataFrame([input_list], columns=column_names[:-1]) # Match training DataFrame structure # Use the same preprocessing pipeline X_processed = preprocessor.transform(input_df) # If sparse, convert to dense if sparse.issparse(X_processed): X_processed = X_processed.toarray() # Perform prediction prediction = model.predict(X_processed) predicted_class = \\">50K\\" if prediction[0][0] > 0.5 else \\"<=50K\\" return predicted_class \`\`\` # Step 3: Double-check Data Alignment and Column Names Errors of this nature can also occur if there's any misalignment between the column names used for training and those used for predicting. Ensure \`column_names\` fully match those used during model training, both in order and spelling. # Step 4: Ensure Correct Data Preparation Before Training Check your initial data loading and preprocessing ensure that no steps are skipped or altered when going from training to prediction - every detail matters, from how you handle missing values to encoding categorical variables. # Troubleshooting Tips 1. **Logging:** Adding print statements or using a debugger to examine \`input_df\` just before preprocessing can reveal mismatches or incorrect formatting. 2. **Review Training Data Preparation:** Revisit how the training data was prepared, looking for steps that might have altered the data in ways that are not being replicated at prediction time. 3. **Error Details:** The specifics of the error message can provide clues. For instance, an error about unknown categories \`'Bachelors'\` suggests an issue with how categorical data is being prepared or encoded. 4. **Testing with Known Examples:** Try running your prediction function with examples that are subsets of your training data (i.e., rows directly taken from the training dataset but without their labels). If these cause errors, there's likely a mismatch in preprocessing steps between training and prediction. By following these steps and recommendations, you should be able to diagnose and fix the issue with unknown categories during the preprocessing step for predictions.

This is wild! 🐉 NostalgicNerd: Yeah, it’s quite the departure from the kangaroo silhouettes we got stuck with in October. Those blobs were… interesting. GraphicGeek: I actually liked the blobs, had a quirky charm to them! But those kangaroo silhouettes as the DOG? That was odd. RetroRanger: Don’t get me started on their Christmas campaign. A Christmas tree made of TV sets? Creative, but felt so out of place. PixelPioneer42: Honestly, I was thrown off by the January TV set showing random images. I thought my screen was glitching out! PixelPioneer42: @RobloxianTV_Rep, can you shed some light on these…unique branding choices? RobloxianTV_Rep: Absolutely, @PixelPioneer42! We’re glad you noticed the changes. Believe it or not, everything from the pink and purple blobs to the TV set Christmas tree was all part of the plan leading to the dragon-themed rebrand. GraphicGeek: All planned? That’s a relief! I thought you guys were just throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks. RobloxianTV_Rep: @GraphicGeek, it might have seemed that way, but each phase served a purpose. We worked closely with Pikacrestive not only on the dragon design but also on the entire journey of rebrands. It was about keeping the audience engaged and curious. NostalgicNerd: So, the entire whirlwind was a buildup to the dragons? Mind blown 🤯. How did you come up with this strategy? RobloxianTV_Rep: Exactly, @NostalgicNerd! We wanted to create a sense of anticipation and surprise. The idea was to take viewers on a dynamic and unpredictable journey. Pikacrestive was pivotal in developing this concept. RetroRanger: I gotta give it to you, that’s some 4D chess marketing strategy. The randomness now feels like a clever narrative. PixelPioneer42: Props to Pikacrestive then! Loving the dragon aesthetic. Out of curiosity, was there a favorite phase among the team? RobloxianTV_Rep: Thank you! We’re thrilled with the feedback on the dragons. Each phase had its champions within the team. Personally, I loved the Christmas campaign for its whimsy, but the dragon rebrand has been the most rewarding to reveal. GraphicGeek: Looking forward to seeing what you all do with this dragon theme. Keep up the inventive work! RobloxianTV_Rep: Thanks to everyone for your support and feedback! We promise there are more surprises in store. Keep watching! 🐉📺 — Note from Moderator: Let’s keep the conversation respectful and constructive, folks!

Those were simpler times, visually mesmerizing. VintageVHS: Oh, totally! And then they had the move into the Perspective idents. The way the logo would form up and disperse into different shapes, like pylons and city buildings… That was peak creativity. PixelAnimator99: Exactly! There was something so captivating about watching those elements come together to form the logo before dispersing back into the scene. It was a clever way to keep the branding central yet fresh with each ident. ClassicCinephile: There was also that bizarre transition out of the perspective idents in 2023, which started to slightly be noticeable with the miscellaneous presentations around mid-August. But then, the idents went all over the place on October 1st. TechTinker: Yeah, I noticed that too. It felt like they were testing the waters with different themes and visuals before fully committing to the new direction. October was wild with the sudden shift to those kangaroo silhouettes and other abstract designs. PixelAnimator99: It’s fascinating how they evolve their branding. From the seamless, cohesive Lights and Perspective idents to experimenting wildly later on. Makes you wonder what the thought process was behind such a drastic change. VintageVHS: True, it’s like they’ve embarked on a journey of redefining their identity periodically. Those early idents had a certain magic to them, though. The way they utilized simple concepts to create something visually appealing was genius. ClassicCinephile: Agreed. Despite the shock of the new themes, I guess it keeps the brand dynamic and unpredictable. They're not afraid to shake things up, that’s for sure. TechTinker: Definitely keeps the audience on their toes. I’m looking forward to seeing how this new dragon theme evolves. If past transitions are anything to go by, we’re in for quite the ride with Robloxian TV. PixelAnimator99: Absolutely. It’s all about the journey with them. Despite the unexpected twists and turns, it’s that unpredictability that keeps us talking and watching. Here’s to more creative reinventions! — Note from Moderator: It’s great to see such engaging discussions about the evolution of Robloxian TV’s branding.

They've completely dropped the \\"Flying Logo\\" idents (that’s what I’ll always call the Perspective ones) and replaced them with, of all things, blob kangaroos. Seems like some sort of fall filler before they transitioned to the Xmas theme. And now? ANOTHER filler set before swapping it out again in what will be under a year. Thoughts? VisualVirtuoso: Honestly, I’m all for the changes. The \\"Flying Logo\\" idents had their time, and while iconic, the blob kangaroos brought something fresh. The Xmas theme was a nice seasonal touch, albeit a bit out of left field. Curious to see what this next filler brings to the table before the next big update. RetroRevivalist: It's a bit jarring, isn't it? I loved the fluidity and elegance of the Flying Logo. The transition to blob kangaroos felt kind of… abrupt? And going through another filler before settling again seems like they're experimenting a lot, maybe too much. DigitalDynamo: I see it as a bold move. The TV landscape's always evolving, and Robloxian TV's no different. The filler periods could be their way of testing the waters with new ideas, keeping things interesting. As for the quick turnovers, it's a way to keep audiences guessing and engaged, in my opinion. ArtisticAdept: True, but there's something to be said for consistency. The Flying Logo had a certain timelessness to it. The constant changes make it hard to feel connected to the brand. However, it's also exciting to see what they come up with next. I just hope they find something that sticks and resonates with viewers. TechTinkerer: I reckon it’s all a part of a larger strategy. Dropping the Flying Logo for the blobs and then onto the Xmas theme – seems like they’re leaning into more thematic, possibly interactive experiences. Perhaps pointing towards an approach where viewer feedback plays a larger part in their creative direction. The quick succession of changes might be testing ground for larger, more permanent shifts. PixelMaster101: All valid points. Change is inevitable, especially in the digital age. Robloxian TV is definitely keeping us on our toes.

Considering any parabola's equation (y = ax^2 + bx + c) and putting (x = 0), we find (y = c). This tells us that (c) is the (y)-intercept of the parabola. The vertex formula doesn’t directly help us calculate (a + b + c) without more characteristic points (like the (x)-intercepts or a specific point other than the vertex), but it’s also important to recognize that the sum (a + b + c) effectively corresponds to the value of (y) when (x = 0), based on (y = ax^2 + bx + c). This means the (y)-intercept of the parabola (where it intersects the (y)-axis, which happens when (x = 0)) would directly give us (c) if we were in a normal scenario looking at (y = ax^2 + bx + c). However, the insight provided doesn't lead to a direct solution without further inputs like the value of \\"a\\" or the (x)-intercepts because we have not transformed the given vertex form into a standard form to directly observe (a), (b), and (c). Without additional details such as the (x)-intercepts or the value of (a), calculating the exact value of (a + b + c) requires assumptions or additional information. Given the formulation of the question, it seems I've steered towards an explanation expecting a calculated transformation without providing the exact value for (a). Without knowing the x-intercepts or having a specific (a) to complete the transformation, determining (a + b + c) correctly from the given equation requires additional information. Given that, let's analyze it from another angle that might provide clarity or a hint towards resolving the question: If we mistakenly jumped too deep into transforming the equation without focusing on the precise question of finding (a + b + c), which is essentially asking for the (y)-intercept ((c) in the standard form) or interpreting how the sum relates to the provided details, we might hit a dead end. So, my initial explanation hit a complexity wall due to misinterpreting the demand for a detailed transformation over a specific, straightforward answer revolving around the characteristics of a parabola. The value of (a + b + c) being the (y)-value where (x = 0), without the intercepts or \\"a\\" value, we can't precisely calculate or assert the sum (a+b+c) in context to the choices given without further parabola details. Reflecting back, there’s a need for clarity on specifics such as parabola direction, width, or additional points to calculate or confidently choose an answer based on the equation's direct transformation or inferred characteristics."},{"instruction":"In the xy-plane, a parabola has vertex (9, −14) and intersects the x-axis at two points. If the equation of the parabola is written in the form y = ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants, which of the following could be the value of a b + + c ? A) −23 B) −19 C) −14 D) −12","output":"To determine the value of (a + b + c), let's reconsider the provided information and the standard equation of a parabola in the form (y = ax^2 + bx + c). Given that the vertex of the parabola is at ((9, -14)), we don't need to actually find (a), (b), and (c) separately to solve this problem. Instead, the question asks us which of the given options could be the value of (a + b + c). **Clarification and Correction:** The key insight to answer this question involves understanding that (a + b + c) represents the value of the function (y) when (x = 0), which means (y = c) when (x = 0) due to the structure of the quadratic equation. However, this interpretation solely as (c) underestimates the given conditions and directly addressing the query: - Given the vertex is at ((9, -14)) and the fact the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points implies it opens either up or down, not affecting (a + b + c) calculation directly since those points or the \\"a\\" value aren't needed for this specific calculation. The attempt to relate (a + b + c) directly as the (y)-intercept (which, in a general interpretation of quadratic equations, equals (c) — the constant term when (x=0)) was misleading in this context without a clear path to calculate or infer it from the conditions provided about the intersect and vertex. However, importantly, what the question seems to be aiming for is an acknowledgment of how constants in the given general quadratic form contribute to the function's output. Upon reflection and refocusing on the question specifics without extrapolating beyond provided details: The question subtly asks for the evaluation at the y-intercept implicitly, suggesting a misunderstanding in my prior explanation focusing on transformation rather than actioning on the direct ask. Given the vertex and the fact it does intersect the x-axis but without direct x-intercepts provided or an explicit \\"a\\" value to demonstrate a full transformation from vertex to standard form while calculating (a + b + c), my initial guidance towards transformation may have convoluted rather than clarified. **Direct Insight**: Without direct application of the initial vertex condition transforming it for \\"a\\", \\"b\\", and \\"c\\", and acknowledging we're asked for a potential sum of these constants - and acknowledging my prior note's misdirection - the practical step was to recognize the question's test of concept understanding rather than computation. The correction here leans on focusing what's asked - a conceptual application of (a + b + c) as a collective value rather than dissecting the parabolic equation without adequate specifics to anchor such an attempt rightfully. Given the correction in approach: - Without explicit relations or a way to directly calculate (a + b + c) given the specific values or transformations clarified in prior responses, it remains essential to acknowledge the oversight in delivering a clear, direct path to the asked value beyond the structured setup provided. **Conclusion**: The clarification effort here acknowledges a gap in the initial response that may have overcomplicated the straightforward ask due to an attempt to apply transformation without clear directives. Without threading into deeper specifics not provided (like the value of \\"a\\" or direct x-intercepts for precise calculations), this rectification addresses an oversight in conceptual application vs. direct calculation. The omission, therefore, lies in aligning a clear, concise path to deduce (a + b + c) given the general parabola parameters provided."},{"instruction":"Function f is defined by f x( ) = −a^x+ b, where a and b are constants.

Additionally, we know from the problem statement that the product of (a) and (b) is (65/7). Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. **Understanding the Transformation and Y-Intercept**: - The y-intercept of the function occurs when (x = 0). Given the function (y = f(x) - 15), when (x = 0), (y = -a^0 + b - 15). 2. **Applying the Y-Intercept Information**: - Since (a^0 = 1) for all (a neq 0), we can simplify this to (y = -1 + b - 15 = b - 16). - Given the y-intercept is ((-99/7)), we can set (b - 16 = -99/7): [b - 16 = -frac{99}{7}] 3. **Solving for b**: - Solve the equation above to find (b): [b = -frac{99}{7} + 16] [b = -frac{99}{7} + frac{112}{7}] [b = frac{13}{7}] 4. **Using the Product of (a) and (b)**: - We're given that (ab = frac{65}{7}), and we've just found that (b = frac{13}{7}). Let's substitute (b) and solve for (a): [aleft(frac{13}{7}right) = frac{65}{7}] [a = frac{65}{7} div frac{13}{7}] [a = 5] Therefore, the value of (a) is 5."},{"instruction":"Who owned the means of production in ancient Rome?

GraphicGeek: I actually liked the blobs, had a quirky charm to them! But those kangaroo silhouettes as the DOG? That was odd. RetroRanger: Don’t get me started on their Christmas campaign. A Christmas tree made of TV sets? Creative, but felt so out of place. PixelPioneer42: Honestly, I was thrown off by the January TV set showing random images. I thought my screen was glitching out! PixelPioneer42: @RobloxianTV_Rep, can you shed some light on these…unique branding choices? RobloxianTV_Rep: Absolutely, @PixelPioneer42! We’re glad you noticed the changes. Believe it or not, everything from the pink and purple blobs to the TV set Christmas tree was all part of the plan leading to the dragon-themed rebrand. GraphicGeek: All planned? That’s a relief! I thought you guys were just throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks. RobloxianTV_Rep: @GraphicGeek, it might have seemed that way, but each phase served a purpose. We worked closely with Pikacrestive not only on the dragon design but also on the entire journey of rebrands. It was about keeping the audience engaged and curious. NostalgicNerd: So, the entire whirlwind was a buildup to the dragons? Mind blown 🤯. How did you come up with this strategy? RobloxianTV_Rep: Exactly, @NostalgicNerd! We wanted to create a sense of anticipation and surprise. The idea was to take viewers on a dynamic and unpredictable journey. Pikacrestive was pivotal in developing this concept. RetroRanger: I gotta give it to you, that’s some 4D chess marketing strategy. The randomness now feels like a clever narrative. PixelPioneer42: Props to Pikacrestive then! Loving the dragon aesthetic. Out of curiosity, was there a favorite phase among the team? RobloxianTV_Rep: Thank you! We’re thrilled with the feedback on the dragons. Each phase had its champions within the team. Personally, I loved the Christmas campaign for its whimsy, but the dragon rebrand has been the most rewarding to reveal.

Write a forum convo saying the 2003 logo of Robloxian TV originally launched with the Lights idents, then carried onto the Perspective idents, (which had the logo form up and disperse, example include pylons, city buildings, etc) Another user says “There was also that bizarre transition out of the perspective idents in 2023, with at least 3 interim packages before we finally got to the Dragons ”","output":"PixelVisionary: Let's not forget where it all started. Back in 2003, Robloxian TV launched with the Lights idents—those were legendary. And then we transitioned into the Perspective idents, where the logo would morph into formations, from pylons to city skylines. Those were the days of iconic TV branding. TechNostalgist: Absolutely, the Perspective idents were a visual feast. The way the logo would assemble and disperse—capturing elements like buildings in such a fluid motion was ahead of its time. But, did anyone else find the leap from those themes to what we had in 2023 a bit jarring? There were, what, at least three interim branding packages before we dove into the Dragons theme. PixelVisionary: That's right. It felt like Robloxian TV was searching for its next big identity. Each interim package felt like a completely different direction. A journey from the comfortable familiarity of the Perspective idents to the sheer unpredictability of what came next. Dragons made out of inanimate objects wasn't something I saw coming! RetroCollector: The transition period was a whirlwind. It's fascinating how they moved from such structured, coherent themes to experimenting with something as out there as pink and purple blobs, and then those kangaroo silhouettes. It made you wonder where the continuity was. TechNostalgist: Yeah, those interim phases threw everyone for a loop. But looking back, it's like watching an artist in the middle of a creative exploration—trying out different styles, themes, and visuals until they land on something that resonates. The Dragons theme is bold, to say the least. DigitalDreamer: It's all about evolution, isn't it? Keeping the audience engaged, guessing, and, more importantly, watching. From Lights to Perspective, and through those wild interim phases to Dragons—the sheer unpredictability has been both a risk and a thrill. PixelVisionary: I suppose that's what keeps it exciting.

This issue arises from expecting tensors of the same shape in operations that involve direct addition. Looking at the error message, it seems the problem lies with the operation \`x + self.pe[:, :x.size(1)]\` in your \`PositionalEncoding\` module's \`forward\` method. Based on the error and the information provided, I suspect the shape of your positional encoding (\`self.pe\`) does not correctly match the shape expected by the inputs it's being added to. Given that \`x\` has shape \`[batch_size, seq_length, d_model]\` where \`d_model\` is 768 (as per your \`SimplifiedGPT\` setup), and considering the error message indicating a mismatch at dimension 2 (the third dimension, due to 0-based indexing, which corresponds to \`d_model\`), it looks like your positional encoding tensor (\`self.pe\`) does not have the right shape on its last dimension. Here are steps to fix it: 1. **Ensure \`PositionalEncoding\`'s Output Matches \`d_model\`:** Make sure that the positional encoding you're generating has the shape \`[1, max_length, d_model]\`, where \`max_length\` is the maximum sequence length you're supporting and \`d_model\` is the dimensionality of your model embeddings. 2. **Adjust \`PositionalEncoding\` Initialization or Forward Method:** You might need to adjust how you initialize or compute \`self.pe\` in the \`PositionalEncoding\` class. Without the exact implementation of your \`PositionalEncoding\` class, I'll provide a generic way to initialize a positional encoding that matches the required shape: \`\`\`python class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module): def __init__(self, d_model, max_length): super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__() # Create a long enough PE pe = torch.zeros(max_length, d_model) position = torch.arange(0, max_length, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1) div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model)) pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term) pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term) pe = pe.unsqueeze(0).transpose(0, 1) # Register as a buffer so it's not a model parameter self.register_buffer('pe', pe) def forward(self, x): # x: [batch_size, seq_length, d_model] return x + self.pe[:x.size(1), :] \`\`\` This example assumes \`d_model\` and \`max_length\` are correctly set to match your model's configuration. Also, please adjust the \`PositionalEncoding\` usage to correctly reflect any changes in dimensionality. The \`PositionalEncoding\` output should align with your embeddings in both sequence length (\`seq_length\`) and feature dimensionality (\`d_model\`)."},{"instruction":"Now we still get this error: Shape of input_ids: torch.Size([1, 1024]) Shape of attention_mask: torch.Size([1, 1024]) Shape of input_ids: torch.Size([1, 1024]) Shape of attention_mask: torch.Size([1, 1024]) Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"c:UsersL14DocumentsProjets3D_engineText_Transformer.py\\", line 112, in <module> outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask) File \\"C:UsersL14AppDataLocalPackagesPythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0LocalCachelocal-packagesPython310site-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1511, in _wrapped_call_impl return self._call_impl(*args, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersL14AppDataLocalPackagesPythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0LocalCachelocal-packagesPython310site-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1520, in _call_impl return forward_call(*args, **kwargs) File \\"c:UsersL14DocumentsProjets3D_engineText_Transformer.py\\", line 50, in forward x = self.embedding(input_ids) + self.positional_encoding(positions) File \\"C:UsersL14AppDataLocalPackagesPythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0LocalCachelocal-packagesPython310site-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1511, in _wrapped_call_impl return self._call_impl(*args, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersL14AppDataLocalPackagesPythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0LocalCachelocal-packagesPython310site-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1520, in _call_impl return forward_call(*args, **kwargs) File \\"c:UsersL14DocumentsProjets3D_engineReal_Transformer.py\\", line 72, in forward return x + self.pe[:x.size(1), :] RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (1024) must match the size of tensor b (768) at non-singleton dimension 2","output":"Given the persistent error and the details you've shared, it's possible there's a misunderstanding or misinterpretation concerning the dimensions involved, particularly with how the \`PositionalEncoding\` is applied to the input embeddings. # Revisiting the Error The error message: \`\`\` RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (1024) must match the size of tensor b (768) at non-singleton dimension 2 \`\`\` indicates that when the model attempts to add the positional encodings to the embeddings (\`x\`), there's a dimension mismatch. # Breaking Down the Issue 1. **Embeddings (\`x\`) Dimension**: Based on GPT-like models, the embeddings typically have the dimension \`[batch_size, seq_length, d_model]\`. Here, \`seq_length\` is 1024 (your maximum sequence length), and \`d_model\` is set to 768, which matches GPT-2's hidden size. 2. **Positional Encoding Dimension**: The positional encoding should match the \`seq_length\` and \`d_model\` dimensions so it can be added directly to the embeddings. This means it should also be \`[1, seq_length, d_model]\` or \`[seq_length, d_model]\` which, upon unsqueezing or expanding for batch size, aligns with the embedding tensor for element-wise addition. 3. **Error Source**: The error implies that the positional encoding's last dimension does not match \`d_model\`. This misalignment suggests an issue in either how the positional encoding tensor is being generated or sliced # Clarifying the Expected Fix Given that we're expecting the embedding (\`x\`) and positional encoding to be addable, both should indeed align in dimensions. The slice \`self.pe[:x.size(1), :]\` should ensure that the first dimension of \`self.pe\` aligns with \`seq_length\`, but we need to confirm the shape of \`self.pe\` is ideally \`[seq_length, d_model]\` after initialization. The \`return x + self.pe[:x.size(1), :]\` operation seems intended to ensure this, but the actual shapes appear mismatched. # Adjusting the \`PositionalEncoding\` Setup Assuming an issue in setting up or using \`PositionalEncoding\`, here's a recap on how it could be structured to avoid dimension mismatch: \`\`\`python import torch import torch.nn as nn import math class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module): def __init__(self, d_model, max_length): super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__() self.pe = torch.zeros(max_length, d_model) position = torch.arange(0, max_length, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1) div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model)) self.pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term) self.pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term) self.pe = self.pe.unsqueeze(0) def forward(self, x): # Add pe to x, assuming x is [batch_size, seq_length, d_model] x = x + self.pe[:, :x.size(1)] return x \`\`\` Given this setup: - Ensure \`max_length\` in this \`PositionalEncoding\` initialization aligns with your expected \`seq_length\`, 1024 in your scenario. - Ensure \`d_model\` matches the model's embedding size, which is 768. This implementation already assumes \`self.pe\` has a shape of \`[1, max_length, d_model]\` which should match your needs. Double-check your actual implementation and initialization of \`PositionalEncoding\` against this template. If the error persists, consider also reviewing how and where you're initializing and applying the \`PositionalEncoding\` to ensure dimensions are correctly aligned throughout your model.

However, upon reviewing the provided \`PositionalEncoding\` class definition, the implementation appears correct and should not, by itself, cause such dimension mismatch errors if used appropriately. # Revisiting the Error in Context Given that the actual implementation of \`PositionalEncoding\` seems appropriately designed to output positional encodings with the shape matching \`[1, seq_length, d_model]\` or after squeezing \`[seq_length, d_model]\`, we might need to focus on how positional encodings are applied in context with the model's input embeddings. The \`PositionalEncoding\` implementation involves a broadcasting operation that adds the positional encoding to each embedding vector within the batch. This operation expects the embedding vectors (\`x\`) to have a matching \`d_model\` dimension with the positional encodings. Your embeddings are shaped \`[batch_size, seq_length, d_model]\`, and the error indicates that the last dimension of a tensor (presumed to be the positional encoding) is 768, while it is being attempted to add to a tensor of a different size in that dimension. # Diagnosing and Solutions 1. **Verify Embedding Dimension (\`d_model\`):** Ensure the \`d_model\` used across your model, embeddings, and positional encodings aligns precisely. 2. **Review Model Forward Pass:** Ensure that, within your model's forward pass (presumably in a \`SimplifiedGPT\`, \`Transformer\`, or similar model), where positional encodings are applied to embeddings, no unintended transformations occur that would alter the dimensions unexpectedly. 3. **Direct Addition Compatibility:** When adding the positional encodings to the embeddings (\`x = x + self.pe[:x.size(1), :]\`), ensure that the dimensions, especially \`d_model\`, are fully compatible. If \`d_model\` is 768, ensure that all tensors in the operation maintain this exact dimensionality without alteration. Considering the details and the contextual nature of the error, here are a couple of additional, more specific suggestions: - **Debugging Print Statements:** Temporarily include print statements for \`x.shape\` and \`self.pe.shape\` right before the addition operation in the \`PositionalEncoding\` forward method. This direct method will confirm that the shapes are what you expect them to be. - **Model Architecture Review:** Double-check the architecture and the input data flow, especially how input embeddings are generated and processed before adding positional encodings. There might be a point where the shape of the input embeddings gets altered unexpectedly. - **Batch Size and Unsqueeze Operations:** Make sure that your input batch is correctly shaped and that any unsqueeze operations (or lack thereof) do not inadvertently alter the expected dimensions—especially given batch processing in PyTorch, where the first dimension is typically reserved for batch size. Without the full error stack that explicitly connects the dots between your provided class definitions and the error site, these generalized points are avenues for investigation based on the shared details.

Für jede steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung hinter einem Netzanschluss hat der Betreiber gegenüber dem Netzbetreiber die Entscheidung zu treffen, ob diese im Fall einer netzorientierten Steuerung a. einen an die einzelne steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung gebundenen Sollwert für den maximalen netzwirksamen Leistungsbezug (Direktansteuerung) oder b. einen Sollwert für den maximalen netzwirksamen Leistungsbezug von einem Energie-Management-System erhält, das seinerseits einen gesamthaften Sollwert für alle an das Energie-Management-System angeschlossenen steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtungen (Steuerung mittels EMS) vom Netzbetreiber zugeteilt bekommt. 4.5. Auch im Fall der Durchführung der netzorientierten Steuerung hat der Betreiber gegenüber dem Netzbetreiber weiterhin einen Anspruch auf einen mindestens zu gewährenden netzwirksamen Leistungsbezug (Mindestleistung). 4.5.1 1Für jede steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung im Sinne der Ziffer 2.4.1., die gemäß Ziffer 4.4.a. (Direktansteuerung) angesteuert wird, beträgt die Mindestleistung 4,2 kW. 2Abweichend vom vorstehenden Satz ergibt sich die Mindestleistung für jede steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung im Sinne der Ziffern 2.4.1.b. sowie 2.4.1.c. (jeweils i.V.m. Ziffer 2.4.2.), die gemäß Ziffer 4.4.a. (Direktansteuerung) angesteuert wird und eine Netzanschlussleistung über 11 kW aufweist, aus der Multiplikation der Netzanschlussleistung der steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung mit einem angemessenen Skalierungsfaktor. 3Bis zum Inkrafttreten einer anderweitigen Empfehlung wird die Angemessenheit vermutet, wenn der Skalierungsfaktor 0,4 beträgt. 4.5.2 1Für alle steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtungen, die gemäß Ziffer 4.4.b. (Steuerung mittels EMS) angesteuert werden, ist die Mindestleistung unter Berücksichtigung eines angemessenen Gleichzeitigkeitsfaktors zu ermitteln. 2Bis zum Inkrafttreten einer anderweitigen Empfehlung wird die Angemessenheit vermutet, wenn die Berechnung wie nachstehend erfolgt: 3Sofern Anlagen im Sinne der Ziffern 2.4.1.b. sowie 2.4.1.c. (jeweils i.V.m. Ziffer 2.4.2.), mit einer Netzanschlussleistung über 11 kW Bestandteil der Steuerung nach Ziffer 4.4.b sind, gilt: Pmin, 14a = Max(0,4 x Psumme WP; 0,4 x PSumme Klima ) + (nsteuVE – 1) x GZF x 4,2 kW 4Ansonsten gilt: Pmin, 14a = 4,2 kW + (nsteuVE – 1) x GZF x 4,2 kW 5Wobei gilt: Pmin, 14a = Mindestleistung nach Ziffer 4.5.2. PSumme WP = Summe der Netzanschlussleistungen der Anlagen nach Ziffern 2.4.1.b. (ggf. i.V.m. Ziffer 2.4.2.) PSumme Klima = Summe der Netzanschlussleistungen der Anlagen nach Ziffern 2.4.1.c. (ggf. i.V.m. Ziffer 2.4.2.) nsteuVE = Anzahl aller steuerbarer Verbrauchseinrichtungen, die nach Ziffer 4.4.b angesteuert werden. GZF = anzuwendender Gleichzeitigkeitsfaktor, hier: nsteuVE 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 >= 9 GZF 0,8 0,75 0,7 0,65 0,6 0,55 0,5 0,45 6Der Betreiber ist berechtigt, den insgesamt gewährten Sollwert für den maximalen netzwirksamen Leistungsbezug über das Energie-Management-System nach eigener Maßgabe einzusetzen. 4.6. 1Der Betreiber hat dafür Sorge zu tragen, dass die steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung mit den notwendigen technischen Einrichtungen einschließlich Steuerungseinrichtungen ausgestattet wird und stets steuerbar ist. 2Sofern es einer steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung aus technischen Gründen nicht möglich ist, den netzwirksamen Leistungsbezug auf den vom Netzbetreiber vorgegebenen Wert zu reduzieren, muss eine Reduzierung auf den nächstgeringeren Wert, der technisch möglich ist, erfolgen. 3Der Betreiber hat technisch sicherzustellen, dass im Fall konkurrierender Anforderungen mit anderweitigen Steuerungsmaßnahmen, insbesondere marktlicher Laststeuerung, der Reduzierung nach dieser Festlegung stets insoweit Vorrang eingeräumt wird, als die Anforderung des Netzbetreibers über die konkurrierende Anforderung hinausgeht oder dieser widerspricht. 4.7. Ein separater Zählpunkt für die steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung ist im Rahmen der Einhaltung der Vorgaben dieser Festlegung nicht erforderlich, auf Wunsch des Betreibers jedoch möglich. 4.8. Für das veränderte Verbrauchsverhalten, das aufgrund der Reduzierung des netzwirksamen Leistungsbezuges einer steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung an der betreffenden Marktlokation hervorgerufen wird, findet kein bilanzieller Ausgleich im Bilanzkreis des Lieferanten statt. 5. Sicherstellung des Netzanschlusses Aufgrund der Teilnahmeverpflichtung aller Betreiber einer steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung nach Ziffer 3.1.b. darf der Netzbetreiber deren Anschluss und Nutzung im Rahmen eines bestehenden oder zu errichtenden Anschlusses insbesondere nicht gemäß §§ 17 Absatz 2, § 18 Absatz 1 Nr. 1 EnWG mit Verweis auf mangelnde Netzkapazität verzögern oder ablehnen. 6. Netzausbau und Netzertüchtigung 6.1. 1Die Pflicht zur vorausschauenden und bedarfsgerechten Netzertüchtigung nach § 11 Absatz 1 EnWG gilt dauerhaft und uneingeschränkt. 2Der bedarfsgerechte Netzausbau hat dabei insbesondere auch hinsichtlich in Zukunft voraussichtlich notwendiger Steuerungsmaßnahmen nach Ziffer 4 vorausschauend zu erfolgen und muss dabei auch das für die jeweilige Region geltende Regionalszenario nach § 14d EnWG berücksichtigen. 6.2. 1Wird in einem Netzbereich eine Maßnahme nach Ziffer 4. oder Ziffer 10.5. durchgeführt und ist mit weiteren Maßnahmen zu rechnen, muss der Netzbetreiber dies in seiner Netzausbau- und Netzertüchtigungsplanung für diesen Netzbereich berücksichtigen und unverzüglich Maßnahmen zur Abhilfe prüfen. 2Maßnahmen in Bezug auf Anlagen nach Ziffer 10.1. bzw. 10.2.b. sind hiervon ausgenommen. 7. Dokumentationspflichten 7.1. Der Netzbetreiber dokumentiert für einen sachkundigen Dritten nachvollziehbar mindestens: a. die Anzahl der jeweiligen pro Netzbereich vorhandenen steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtungen, b. die Netzzustandsermittlungen, die zu einer netzorientieren Steuerung geführt haben sowie die Adressaten, Intensität und Dauer der Maßnahme; im Fall der präventiven Steuerung nach Ziffer 10.5. sind die zugrunde gelegten Berechnungen und durchgeführten Maßnahmen zu dokumentieren, c. 1alle Maßnahmen, die zur Vermeidung der Reduzierung des netzwirksamen Leistungsbezugs unternommen werden. 2Dies beinhaltet insbesondere Maßnahmen zu Optimierung, Verstärkung oder Ausbau des betroffenen Netzbereichs. 7.2. Der Betreiber hat dafür Sorge zu tragen, dass die Umsetzung der vom Netzbetreiber vorgegebenen Reduzierung des netzwirksamen Leistungsbezugs in geeigneter Weise im Einzelfall für den Netzbetreiber nachvollziehbar dargelegt werden kann. 7.3. Die unter den Ziffern 7.1. und 7.2. genannten Informationen sind mindestens 2 Jahre nach der erfolgten Maßnahme vorzuhalten. 7.4. 1Die Dokumentationen nach den Ziffern 7.1. und 7.2. sind auf Verlangen der Bundesnetzagentur vorzulegen. 2Die Dokumentation nach Ziffer 7.2. ist auf Verlangen bei berechtigten Zweifeln dem jeweiligen Netzbetreiber vorzulegen. 8. Melde- und Informationspflichten 8.1. 1Nach § 19 Absatz 2 NAV besteht die Verpflichtung, jede technische Inbetriebnahme einer steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung dem Netzbetreiber im Voraus mitzuteilen. 2Zudem hat der Betreiber jede geplante leistungswirksame Änderung und dauerhafte Außerbetriebnahme einer steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung dem Netzbetreiber vor der leistungswirksamen Änderung oder Außerbetriebnahme anzuzeigen. 8.2. Die Information des Betreibers a. 1über eine aktuell stattfindende netzorientierte Steuerung wird durch den Netzbetreiber bereitgestellt. 2Es obliegt dem Betreiber, die zum Empfang der Information notwendigen Voraussetzungen in geeigneter Weise sicherzustellen. b. 1über den Zeitpunkt, zu dem die steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung erstmals präventiv im Sinne von Ziffer 10.5. gesteuert wird sowie den Zeitpunkt, zu dem sie aus der präventiven Steuerung im Sinne von Ziffer 10.5. bzw. der Steuerung nach Ziffer 10.4. Satz 4 in die netzorientierte Steuerung nach Ziffer 4. überführt wird, erfolgt durch den Netzbetreiber in Textform vor diesem Zeitpunkt. 2Die Mitteilung enthält die Angabe, welchem Netzbereich die steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung zugeordnet ist. 8.3. Die Information des Lieferanten a. über die erstmalige Durchführung einer präventiven Steuerung im Sinne von Ziffer 10.5., b. hinsichtlich der Überführung einer steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung von der präventiven Steuerung im Sinne von Ziffer 10.5. bzw. der Steuerung nach Ziffer 10.4. Satz 4 in die netzorientierte Steuerung sowie c. über die Durchführung jeder netzorientierten Steuerung erfolgt im Rahmen der elektronischen Marktkommunikation. 8.4. 1Netzbetreiber weisen die Netzbereiche, in denen Steuerungsmaßnahmen i.S.v. Ziffer 4. oder Ziffer 10.5. stattfinden, in einheitlichem Format auf einer gemeinsamen Internetplattform aus. 2Für den Betreiber muss nachvollziehbar sein, welchem Netzbereich seine Anlage zugeordnet ist. 3Die Veröffentlichung enthält zudem eine maschinenlesbare Liste zur Angabe a. 1der Art der Steuerung nach Ziffer 4. oder 10.5., der Anzahl der betroffenen steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtungen, der durchschnittlich zur Kürzung angewiesenen Leistung sowie der Gesamtdauer der Maßnahmen. 2Diese Angaben erfolgen unter Ausweisung der Postleitzahl des Netzbereichs (bezogen auf die Trafostation) in monatlicher Auflösung und sind bis zum 15. Kalendertag des Folgemonats zu veröffentlichen, b. ob und welche Maßnahmen zur Reduzierung von Steuerungsmaßnahmen ergriffen werden und wann diese abgeschlossen sein werden. 9. Haftungsfreistellung 1Der Betreiber hat den Netzbetreiber von möglichen Haftungsansprüchen in Bezug auf Schäden freizustellen, die der Betreiber oder Dritte dadurch erleiden, dass der Netzbetreiber unter Einhaltung der Vorgaben dieser Festlegung eine Reduzierung der netzwirksamen Bezugsleistung in Bezug auf eine steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtung auslöst. 2Nicht von der Haftungsfreistellung umfasst sind Schäden aus der Verletzung des Lebens, des Körpers oder der Gesundheit, die auf einer fahrlässigen Pflichtverletzung des Netzbetreibers oder einer vorsätzlichen oder fahrlässigen Pflichtverletzung eines gesetzlichen Vertreters oder Erfüllungsgehilfen des Netzbetreibers beruhen. 3Ebenso nicht von der Haftungsfreistellung erfasst sind sonstige Schäden, die auf einer grob fahrlässigen Pflichtverletzung des Netzbetreibers oder auf einer vorsätzlichen oder grob fahrlässigen Pflichtverletzung eines gesetzlichen Vertreters oder Erfüllungsgehilfen des Netzbetreibers beruhen. 10. Übergangsvorschriften 10.1. Für alle Verbrauchseinrichtungen, die vor dem 01.01.2024 in Betrieb genommen wurden und für die bis zum Zeitpunkt des Inkrafttretens dieser Festlegung ein reduziertes Netzentgelt nach §14a Abs. 2 Satz 1 EnWG oder der korrespondierenden Vorgängerregelung gewährt worden ist, gelten die bisherigen Regelungen bis längstens zum 31.12.2028 unverändert fort. 10.2. Für Verbrauchseinrichtungen nach Ziffer 10.1., a. die steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtungen im Sinne der Ziffer 2.4. dieser Festlegung sind, gelten spätestens ab dem 01.01.2029 die vorbenannten Vorgaben dieser Festlegung, b. die Nachtspeicherheizungen sind, gilt die bisherige Regelung nach §14a Abs. 2 Satz 1 EnWG oder der korrespondierenden Vorgängerregelung bis zu deren Beendigung oder der Außerbetriebnahme der Verbrauchseinrichtung fort, c. die zu keiner der vorstehend unter a. oder b. genannten Gruppen zählen, besteht keine Möglichkeit zur Teilnahme an der netzorientieren Steuerung. 10.3. Für steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtungen im Sinne der Ziffer 2.4. dieser Festlegung, die vor dem 01.01.2024 in Betrieb gegangen sind und nicht zu den Anlagen nach Ziffer 10.1. zählen, kommt diese Festlegung nicht zur Anwendung. 10.4. 1Betreiber einer steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung nach Ziffer 10.2.a. und Ziffer 10.3. können jederzeit auf eigenen Wunsch in die netzorientierte Steuerung nach Maßgabe dieser Festlegung wechseln. 2Der Netzbetreiber kann den Wechsel nicht ablehnen. 3Ein erneuter Wechsel zurück in eine Regelung nach §14a Abs. 2 Satz 1 EnWG oder in die korrespondierende Vorgängerregelung ist nicht möglich. 4Solange beim Netzbetreiber die Voraussetzungen für die Durchführung der netzorientierten Steuerung nach Ziffer 4. noch nicht gegeben sind, ist der Netzbetreiber in Bezug auf die von Satz 1 erfassten Betreiber von Anlagen nach Ziffer 10.2.a. längstens bis zum 31.12.2025 berechtigt, die bis zum Wechsel angewandte Art der Steuerung beizubehalten; Ziffer 10.5. findet auf diese Anlagen solange keine Anwendung. 10.5. Kommt der Netzbetreiber auf der Grundlage der ihm vorliegenden netzplanerischen Daten zum Ergebnis, dass eine Gefährdung oder Störung der Sicherheit oder Zuverlässigkeit seines Netzes zu erwarten ist und sind bei ihm die Voraussetzungen für die Durchführung der netzorientierten Steuerung nach Ziffer 4. noch nicht gegeben, so darf der Netzbetreiber längstens bis zum 31.12.2028 unter den nachgenannten Bedingungen und insoweit abweichend von Ziffer 4. Gebrauch vom Einsatz einer präventiven Steuerung machen: a. ab dem Zeitpunkt der erstmaligen Durchführung der präventiven Steuerung im betreffenden Netzbereich darf der Netzbetreiber diese bis zum Vorliegen der Voraussetzungen der Ziffer 4., längstens aber für 24 Monate anwenden, b. auch im Fall der präventiven Steuerung ist zugunsten des Betreibers einer steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtung die Gewährung der Mindestleistung gemäß Ziffer 4.5. sicherzustellen und c. die Anwendung der präventiven Steuerung ist auf zwei Stunden täglich beschränkt. 10.6. Auf steuerbare Verbrauchseinrichtungen, a. die nachweislich technisch nicht gesteuert werden können, b. deren Steuerungsfähigkeit auch nicht mit vertretbarem technischem Aufwand hergestellt werden kann und c. die bis zum Ablauf des 31.12.2026 in Betrieb genommen werden, finden die Ziffern 3. - 5. dieser Festlegung keine Anwendung. 10.7. Veröffentlichungen der Netzbetreiber nach Ziffer 8.4. sowie die Dokumentationspflichten der Betreiber nach Ziffer 7.2. haben erstmalig ab dem 01.03.2025 zu erfolgen. 11. Inkrafttreten Diese Festlegung tritt am 01.01.2024 in Kraft.

Wenn ein Dokument in Abschnitte, Paragraphen oder Artikel unterteilt ist, können \\"Ziffern\\" dazu dienen, spezifische Unterpunkte oder Unterabschnitte innerhalb dieser größeren Teile zu identifizieren. Beispielsweise in einem rechtlichen oder regulatorischen Text, wie dem oben angeführten Beispiel, wo jede Ziffer einen bestimmten Aspekt oder Regelungsbereich innerhalb der Festlegung definiert. 2. **Randnummer (Rn.)**: Bei Randnummern handelt es sich um fortlaufende Zahlen, die meist am Rand juristischer Kommentare oder in der Literatur (insbesondere bei Entscheidungen von Gerichten) zu finden sind. Ihre Hauptfunktion besteht darin, die Navigation und das Zitieren innerhalb eines Textes zu erleichtern, insbesondere in umfangreichen Werken, wo eine spezifische Stelle oder Argumentation aufgrund der Seitenzahl oder der Paragrafennummer allein schwer zu finden wäre. Randnummern ermöglichen eine präzise Verweisung auf bestimmte Passagen oder Argumente, unabhängig von der Seite oder dem Abschnitt, in dem sie erscheinen. **Beispiel zur Verwendung**: - In einem Gesetzestext oder einer Verordnung könnte man auf \\"Ziffer 4.3\\" verweisen, um einen spezifischen Unterabschnitt innerhalb des vierten Hauptabschnitts anzusprechen. - Um in einem juristischen Kommentar oder einem Urteil ein spezifisches Argument oder eine Feststellung anzuführen, würde man die entsprechende Randnummer verwenden, beispielsweise \\"siehe Rn. 15\\", was bedeutet, dass der Punkt oder das Argument, auf das Bezug genommen wird, beim Text neben der Randnummer 15 zu finden ist. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass \\"Ziffern\\" hauptsächlich in strukturierten Texten wie Gesetzen, Verordnungen oder Richtlinien verwendet werden, um bestimmte Abschnitte oder Punkte zu benennen, während \\"Randnummern\\" in wissenschaftlichen, juristischen Kommentaren oder Urteilsbegründungen zum Einsatz kommen, um eine präzise Verweisung auf Textpassagen zu ermöglichen."},{"instruction":"ist ein netzbetreiber eine institution","output":"Ja, ein Netzbetreiber kann als eine Institution betrachtet werden, insbesondere im Kontext von Energieversorgungsnetzen, Telekommunikationsnetzen oder anderen infrastrukturellen Netzwerken. Im Allgemeinen bezeichnet der Begriff \\"Institution\\" eine Einrichtung oder Organisation, die einen bestimmten Zweck erfüllt oder eine spezifische Funktion in der Gesellschaft oder in einem Sektor hat. Im Falle eines Netzbetreibers ist diese spezifische Funktion der Betrieb, die Instandhaltung und die Entwicklung eines Versorgungsnetzes, beispielsweise für Strom, Gas, Wasser oder Daten. Netzbetreiber sind in der Regel rechtlich definierte Körperschaften oder Unternehmen, denen von staatlichen Regulierungsbehörden die Verantwortung übertragen wurde, ein Netzwerk für die Verteilung von Ressourcen oder Dienstleistungen zu managen. Sie können sowohl im privaten als auch im öffentlichen Eigentum stehen und haben oft gesetzlich festgelegte Pflichten und Befugnisse, um den sicheren, zuverlässigen und effizienten Betrieb des Netzwerks zu gewährleisten. In vielen Ländern unterliegen Netzbetreiber staatlicher Regulierung, um sicherzustellen, dass sie ihre wesentlichen Dienste auf faire, gerechte und für die Allgemeinheit zugängliche Weise anbieten. Diese Regulierung kann auch Wettbewerbsbedingungen festlegen und die Tarife überwachen, die von den Netzbetreibern für die Nutzung ihrer Netze erhoben werden. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass Netzbetreiber als institutionelle Akteure innerhalb der Infrastruktursektoren fungieren, mit spezifischen Verantwortlichkeiten und Regelungen, die sicherstellen sollen, dass die von ihnen bereitgestellten essenziellen Dienstleistungen die Anforderungen der Gesellschaft und der Wirtschaft erfüllen."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this discord chat log but everyone is a neckbeard, keep the original format. “M_717 — 03/05/2024 7:19 PM Marcello the kind of person to send this unironically https://youtu.be/iiG-8cmQrKE YouTube LARRAY send this to a person you hate with no context Image leet — 03/05/2024 7:21 PM Fr Spartan_godrage — 03/05/2024 7:44 PM leet — 03/05/2024 7:44 PM @oerdin_SAD M_717 — 03/05/2024 7:44 PM leet — 03/05/2024 7:44 PM Pls kick marcello Spartan_godrage — 03/05/2024 7:45 PM Really ?

Despite a lack of knowing what Daenerys knows, Arya/Daenerys expertly Crafts a plan from what she knows, and Jon agrees to it. Arya/Daenerys then dismisses him. As soon as Jon leaves and shuts the door, Arya pulls off the Daenerys face.","output":"As the gentle rustle of silk and the faint clink of chainmail filled the dimly lit hall of Winterfell, Jon Snow approached what he believed to be Daenerys Targaryen, standing by the vast window overlooking the snow-covered fields. The room, warmed by the flickering flames in the hearth, seemed almost to embrace the silver-haired queen, her back turned to him, her posture regal yet tense. \\"Your Grace,\\" Jon began, his tone respectful yet strained under the weight of uncertain alliances and the looming threat of the Night King. Daenerys, or rather Arya wearing the face of the dragon queen, turned to face him, her expression an impeccable mimicry of Daenerys's poise and authority. Yet, within those violet eyes, a spark of Stark fierceness lingered, unseen by Jon. \\"Jon Snow,\\" she said, her voice carrying the confident timbre of a queen. \\"I seek your counsel. Tell me, what plans does Sansa Stark have in motion? The North is critical to our success.\\" Jon hesitated, his loyalty to his family momentarily clashing with his duty to his queen. However, seeing the woman he loved, or believed he did, in distress, he chose to confide in her. \\"Sansa is rallying the houses of the North,\\" he revealed, his voice dropping to a whisper. \\"She means to ensure that Winterfell can stand, even without the aid of your dragons or the Unsullied. She doesn't trust easily, not after everything.\\" Arya, behind Daenerys's facade, absorbed this information, her mind racing. She knew Sansa's strengths and her cautious nature all too well. It was this, coupled with her own knowledge of Westeros and its politics, that allowed her to conceive a plan neither the real Daenerys nor Jon would have foreseen. \\"Very well,\\" Arya-as-Daenerys spoke after a moment of thoughtful silence. \\"We shall lend our support subtly. Let us reinforce the defenses of Winterfell, but under the guise of preparing for the march south. This way, Sansa's efforts are bolstered, and our true intentions remain hidden from our enemies.\\" Jon, taken aback by this show of support for his sister's independence, nodded, a newfound respect for Daenerys dawning in his eyes. \\"Your Grace, you have my word. I will see it done.\\" As Jon turned to leave, Arya/Daenerys added, \\"And Jon, ensure this stays between us. For the good of our alliance and the battles ahead.\\" \\"Of course, Your Grace.\\" With that, Jon Snow exited, closing the heavy wooden door behind him with a soft thud. The moment the door shut, Arya Stark reached up to her face, peeling away the mask of Daenerys Targaryen. The silver hair and violet eyes gave way to her familiar features, the face of a Stark, of a fierce and cunning wolf. Standing alone, Arya sighed, a mixture of relief and determination settling over her. Her plan was bold, perhaps even more so because it wasn’t just about aiding the living against the dead or securing the North's independence. It was a testament to her growth, to her understanding of politics, deception, and the importance of family. With Jon unknowingly aiding her, Sansa's position would be strengthened, and the North would stand a better chance. Arya Stark, the Faceless Girl, the Night Wolf, had played her part perfectly. Now, she had to watch as her plan unfolded, ready to face the consequences and triumphs it would bring. For the North, for her family, for Winterfell."},{"instruction":"Write a prequel story to this, about Arya creating the Daenerys mask using chemistry, sculpting it and the hair out of a mysterious substance, before putting it on.","output":"Beneath the ancient, shadowed halls of Winterfell, in a room long forgotten by all but a select few, Arya Stark labored in secrecy. The air was thick with the scent of oils and the earthy musk of old stone. Before her lay an array of materials and tools, scattered across a sturdy wooden table. Arya's focus was absolute, her hands steady as she embarked on a task unlike any other she had faced. In the center of the table lay a shallow basin filled with a mysterious, luminous substance that glowed faintly in the dim light—a gift from the House of Black and White, a remembrance of her time with the Faceless Men. It was this substance, rare and precious, that held the key to Arya's ambitious endeavor: the creation of a mask so perfect, it could deceive even those who knew Daenerys Targaryen intimately. Arya began with the sculpture, her fingers moving with practiced ease as she shaped the substance, drawing upon her memories and the borrowed visages she had studied during her time in Braavos. She molded the jawline with delicate precision, crafted the high cheekbones, and carved out the elegant, regal features of the Dragon Queen. The substance yielded to her touch, almost as if it were alive, reacting to Arya's intentions and the images held firmly in her mind. Once satisfied with the sculpture, Arya focused on the color, mixing oils and dyes with the substance to capture the pale, almost ethereal complexion of Daenerys. The task required patience and a keen eye for detail, for the mask had to be flawless, an exact replica that bore no trace of its artificial origin. The most challenging task, however, lay in replicating the distinctive silver-gold hair of the Targaryen queen. Arya turned to a collection of fine silks and thin, gossamer threads, combining them with a portion of the mysterious substance. Through a process partly alchemical and partly artisanal, she transformed the materials into lustrous, flowing locks that seemed to radiate an inner light, mirroring the ethereal beauty of Daenerys's hair. With the mask and hair complete, Arya stood back, examining her work critically. It was more than a mask; it was a masterpiece of deception, a testament to her skills, and a bridge between her past and the role she must now play. Taking a deep breath, Arya lifted the mask, feeling its subtle weight in her hands. She placed it against her face, feeling a cool, tingling sensation as the substance adhered to her skin, melding with her features, reshaping them, transforming her into someone else entirely. The sensation was familiar—this was not the first face she had worn, but it was certainly the most significant. As the mask solidified and adjusted, Arya donned the hair, watching as it cascaded down her shoulders in a silver wave. The transformation was complete. Looking into the small, polished steel mirror she had brought with her, Arya Stark no longer stared back. Instead, Daenerys Targaryen, the Mother of Dragons, the Breaker of Chains, gazed back with violet eyes filled with determination and spirit. The stakes were high, the danger immense, but Arya was ready. As she emerged from the shadows of the crypt, the mask in place, Arya Stark stepped into the light, embarking on a mission that would forever alter the fate of Westeros. Her journey as Arya had prepared her for this moment, and as Daenerys, she would see it through. The game of thrones awaited, and Arya Stark was ready to play her part."},{"instruction":"Write A story, during a tense stand off with the real Daenerys and her soldiers, Arya, wearing the mask, and holding a dragon egg, decides to get Dracarys to set fire to the building they are all in, if only for a distraction, by mimicking Daenerys’ voice. As the fire comes, Arya runs away, ripping the Daenerys mask off and throwing it into the fire. Before all this happens, have Daenerys demand, in character, using pathos and logos, Arya hand the egg over, and Arya refuses using the same method, albeit crudely.","output":"In the heart of Dragonstone, tension crackled through the air like static, every moment taut as a drawn bowstring. Inside the dimly lit chamber, where shadows danced along the walls and the faint, fiery glow of torches illuminated the faces of those present, two queens stood face-to-face in a moment that would surely tip the scales of power. Daenerys Targaryen, the true Mother of Dragons, stared down the figure before her—herself, or so it seemed. The imposter, Arya Stark, disguised with uncanny precision, held a dragon egg, ancient and priceless, close to her chest. Behind Daenerys, her loyal soldiers stood ready, the Unsullied unwavering in their discipline, their spears an extension of their will. \\"Give me the egg, child,\\" Daenerys's voice was firm, resonant with the authority of one who had freed slaves and conquered cities. \\"You know not the power you hold, the danger it represents. It belongs with its kin, under the protection of their true mother. This is not merely a gem to be hoarded—it is life, potential, fire made flesh.\\" Arya, beneath the visage of Queen Daenerys, met her gaze, her heart racing yet her voice steady. \\"And who decides its rightful place? You, who flies on the back of a beast, raining fire on those who oppose you? This egg—this life within—deserves a chance beyond serving as a weapon. I hold it, and I will protect it. With respect, my queen,\\" Arya's use of Daenerys's title was both mocking and oddly genuine, \\"you cannot claim to understand all paths. Not anymore.\\" The real Daenerys's eyes narrowed, her empathy for the creature within the egg clashing against her frustration at this unprecedented defiance. \\"You dare question my care for my children? My dragons are not mere tools of war. They are part of me, as this egg should be. Think, child, of the destruction it could cause if mishandled. I offer you a choice—stand with me, or stand aside.\\" Arya weighed her options, the egg a heavy burden in more ways than one. The standoff had reached its zenith, and with a room filled with Daenerys's soldiers, a frontal confrontation was suicide. She needed a diversion, and in a moment of wild inspiration, she saw her path. In a voice that mirrored Daenerys to perfection, Arya commanded, \\"Dracarys.\\" The chamber erupted into chaos as a jet of flame burst forth, not from one of the dragons, but from a hidden source Arya had prepared, a trap intended as a last resort. The fire roared to life, engulfing the chamber and forcing Daenerys and her soldiers to retreat or risk being consumed by the flames. Using the confusion to her advantage, Arya sprinted away, the dragon egg secured. As she fled, she reached up to her face, tearing away the mask of Daenerys Targaryen and casting it into the fire. The mask curled and blackened, the visage of the dragon queen being consumed by the very element she was known to command. Outside, the cool night air embraced Arya as she escaped into the shadows, her heart pounding, the egg still in her possession. Behind her, the blaze illuminated Dragonstone, a beacon of defiance in the dark. Arya had entered the lair of dragons and emerged unscathed, with the future crackling beneath her fingertips. In the days to come, the tale of the standoff at Dragonstone would spread, stirring unrest and awe alike. Arya Stark, the faceless wolf, had challenged the Mother of Dragons and lived to tell the tale. Yet amid the chaos of fire and deception, one truth remained—Arya Stark would go to any length to protect what she believed in, even if it meant facing dragons."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but include Daenerys being slightly indignant at someone wearing her face, and the fire comes from an actual dragon.","output":"In the haunting shadow of Dragonstone, the air was thick with anticipation, a palpable tension that wove through the ancient stone chambers like a silent specter. Within a room dimly lit by flickering torches, two figures stood in confrontation, a surreal reflection of power and defiance. Daenerys Targaryen, true heir to the Targaryen dynasty, fixed a stern gaze upon the figure before her—a mirror image of herself, unsettling and uncanny. The imposter, Arya Stark, disguised with remarkable precision, clutched a dragon egg tightly against her, its obsidian shell absorbing the light around it. Behind the true Daenerys, her loyal soldiers, the Unsullied, stood ready, their spears an extension of their queen's will. \\"How dare you?\\" Daenerys's voice was a blend of incredulity and indignance, her pride wounded by the effrontery of someone daring to wear her face, to claim her identity. \\"To don my visage as if it were a mummer's mask and then to threaten the future of my children with your ignorance. Hand over the egg. Such power, such potential, it belongs under the care of its true mother, not in the hands of a Stark playing at games of deception.\\" Arya, beneath the guise of the dragon queen, met Daenerys's fierce gaze without flinching, her resolve unwavering despite the gravity of the confrontation. \\"Power? Is that all you see? This egg is more than a weapon, more than a claim to your throne. It deserves a chance at life, beyond the shadows of war and conquest. I respect your bond with your dragons, but your path isn't the only one. This egg remains with me.\\" Visibly shaken by the audacity of Arya's words, Daenerys felt a surge of protectiveness for the unborn dragon within the egg. \\"My children are not mere tools of conquest. They are part of me, a bond forged in fire and blood. You underestimate the care I have for them, the lengths I would go to ensure their safety. Stand down, child, and let us not spill blood over what can be resolved.\\" The tension reached its zenith, a confrontation seemingly inevitable. Arya knew she could not best the Unsullied in combat, not here, not now. Her mind raced, plotting, until a daring plan took shape—a gamble that could cost her everything or afford her a chance at escape. With Daenerys's own voice, strikingly mimicked, Arya commanded, \\"Dracarys.\\" The chamber erupted into sudden chaos as, through an open window, the silhouette of Drogon materialized, his throat glowing with impending fire. His loyalty to Daenerys was absolute, but the command, issued in his mother's voice, spurred him into action. A jet of flame burst forth, not aimed at anyone, but setting the chamber ablaze, the fierce fire consuming everything in its path. In the ensuing confusion, Arya seized her chance, darting away with the dragon egg still in her grasp. As she fled, she tore away the mask of Daenerys Targaryen, casting it behind her. The mask, the very visage of the dragon queen, was swallowed by the flames, an unwitting sacrifice to her own dragon's fire. The cool embrace of the night air was a sharp contrast to the inferno Arya left behind. Heart pounding, she vanished into the darkness, the prize still hers. Dragonstone remained, a tower alight against the night, a testament to her daring. As the fire raged, Daenerys emerged from her stronghold, fury and loss warring within her. The audacity of Arya Stark, a girl daring to wear the face of a queen and command her own dragon, would not be forgotten. This act of defiance, this breach of identity and power, had ignited a flame that would not be easily quenched. In the wake of the confrontation at Dragonstone, stories would spread, igniting rumors and wonder alike. Arya Stark, the faceless wolf, had dared defy the Mother of Dragons and escape her wrath. Yet beyond the tales of fire and daring, a truth lingered—a dragon egg, a symbol of life and power, remained in the hands of a Stark, its future unwritten."},{"instruction":"Write a story about Arya wearing a Cersei mask and Gendry disguised as a Lannister soldier, going on a mission together, to obtain information and create confusion, by giving different soldiers different orders, before escaping through the secret passage, entirely out of character. Outside, Arya, still wearing the Cersei mask, gives Gendry a hug and a playful kiss on the cheek, and Gendry bats her away, taking off his helmet, telling her not to kiss him with that face on, and Arya chuckles, peeling it off. Don’t reveal that Cersei and the soldier are Arya and Gendry in disguise till the very end.","output":"In the dim corridors of the Red Keep, Queen Cersei Lannister moved with a purpose, her emerald eyes scanning the surroundings with a keen awareness. Beside her marched a Lannister soldier, his armor gleaming under the flickering torchlight, a silent guardian to his queen. Their steps echoed through the stone halls, a testament to the power and fear their presence commanded. The queen, known for her merciless resolve and cunning mind, seemed to harbor a different agenda this evening—an agenda that involved spreading whispers and orders that sowed seeds of confusion among the ranks of the Lannister soldiers. \\"Divide the forces,\\" Cersei commanded to a group of Red Cloaks, her voice laced with authority. \\"Half will patrol the eastern walls; the others will secure the dungeons. The enemies are cunning—they strike where we least expect.\\" The soldiers nodded, taking their leave to fulfill the queen's bidding, unaware of the seeds of chaos being planted. Further down the corridor, she stopped another patrol. \\"The armory—it needs more guards. Double them before dawn,\\" she instructed with a wave of her hand, the Lannister soldier beside her nodding in silent agreement. As they continued their mission, weaving through the castle's labyrinthine passages, their steps led them closer to their true objective—a hidden passage known only to a select few, a passage that promised a silent escape from the shadows of the Red Keep. Without a word, the queen and her guard slipped into the darkness of the secret passage, their figures vanishing as if swallowed by the night itself. The silent tunnels echoed with their footsteps, a stark contrast to the confusion they had left behind in the brightly lit halls above. Emerging into the cool air of the night, outside the towering walls of the keep, Queen Cersei turned to her loyal soldier, a rare smile playing on her lips. In a move entirely out of character for the ruthless ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, she pulled him into a hug and planted a playful kiss on his cheek. The soldier immediately batted her away, his helmet clattering to the ground. \\"Don't kiss me with that face on,\\" he exclaimed, his voice tinged with both horror and amusement. Laughter bubbled up from the queen, a sound so out of place with her usual demeanor that it could only belong to another. With deft fingers, she peeled away the mask that had sculpted her features into those of Cersei Lannister, revealing the laughing face of Arya Stark beneath. Gendry, now standing helmetless and grinning, shook his head, his affection for the audacious Stark girl shining through his teasing admonishment. \\"That's better,\\" he said, a smile creasing his face. \\"Don't ever do that again.\\" Arya chuckled, the mask of Cersei now dangling loosely in her hand. \\"It worked, didn't it? Confusion is an excellent distraction.\\" Together, they laughed, their mission completed—a mission that had sown discord among the Lannister ranks and allowed them a glimpse into the heart of the enemy’s stronghold. The night was theirs, and as they vanished into the darkness, only the echoes of their laughter and the shifting shadows remained as evidence of their daring escapade within the walls of the Red Keep."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but include at the end, ‘Cersei’ playfully telling Gendry the kiss was just a gift for her Loyal soldier, before peeling off the mask.","output":"In the dimly lit corridors of the Red Keep, under the cover of night, the figure of Queen Cersei Lannister was a commanding presence, her steps echoing with authority and purpose. By her side, a Lannister soldier, armored and vigilant, followed closely, a silent accomplice to the queen’s enigmatic mission. This night, the queen’s agenda was veiled in secrecy, her commands whispered in passing, sowing a web of confusion among the Lannister soldiers. To one group, she decreed, \\"The eastern walls are vulnerable; half of you, guard them until the sun rises.\\" The guards hurried away, unknowingly part of a grander scheme. Further along, another patrol received contradicting orders. \\"The dungeons are our weak point tonight. Strengthen them,\\" Cersei commanded, her tone leaving no room for doubt. The bewildered soldiers complied, their paths set on a course orchestrated by their queen. Every whispered order, every quiet command, was a deliberate stroke in the canvas of chaos Cersei and her soldier painted within the Red Keep that night. But the true masterpiece awaited in the shadows—a hidden passage that promised escape and anonymity from the castle's prying eyes. The moment they slipped into the secret tunnel, the queen and her soldier abandoned the rigidity of their roles, their pace quickening with the thrill of their covert escape. The passage, forgotten by time, offered silent testimony to their audacious endeavor. Emerging into the openness of the night, free from the confines of the castle, \\"Cersei\\" turned to her companion, her expression softening in the moonlight. Without a moment's hesitation, she embraced the Lannister soldier, her lips finding his cheek in a gesture so uncharacteristic for the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, it could belong to no one else but an imposter. \\"Don't kiss me with that face on,\\" the soldier protested, his voice filled with humor and disbelief, his helmet tumbling to the ground as he stepped back. The laughter that followed was too lighthearted, too free to belong to Cersei Lannister. It was Arya Stark who stood before him, her hands deftly peeling away the mask that had morphed her features into those of the queen. The mask dangled in her hand, Arya's smirk playful and triumphant under the moonlight. \\"Consider it a gift for her loyal soldier,\\" she quipped, winking at Gendry, whose discomfort turned to amusement at the reveal. Arya's daring grin was the last piece of the puzzle, a fitting end to their night of deception and espionage. Together, they had woven a tapestry of confusion that would keep the Lannister forces reeling for days.

Gli ugelli in acciaio inossidabile sono una scelta eccellente per questi tipi di filamento poiché sono più resistenti all'usura rispetto agli ugelli standard in ottone. Ecco alcune linee guida generali per la stampa con filamenti rinforzati con fibre di carbonio: 1. **Temperatura dell'ugello**: I filamenti rinforzati con carbonio spesso richiedono temperature di estrusione leggermente superiori rispetto ai filamenti standard. Un buon punto di partenza potrebbe essere tra 230°C e 260°C, a seconda della base del filamento (PLA, PETG, Nylon, ecc.). Potresti dover sperimentare per trovare la temperatura ottimale per il tuo filamento specifico. 2. **Velocità di stampa**: La velocità di stampa dovrebbe essere ridotta rispetto alla stampa standard per garantire una buona adesione tra gli strati e ridurre il rischio di intasamenti. Iniziare con una velocità di stampa di circa 40-50 mm/s potrebbe essere una buona idea ed eventualmente adattarla in base ai risultati. 3. **Altezza dello strato**: Con materiali abrasivi come il filamento rinforzato con carbonio, potresti ottenere risultati migliori con altezze di strato leggermente superiori, come 0.2 mm. Questo può aiutare a ridurre l'usura dell'ugello e migliorare la qualità di stampa. 4. **Retrazione**: Poiché i filamenti rinforzati tendono ad essere più fluidi, potresti dover regolare le impostazioni di retrazione per evitare filamenti eccessivi o stringing. Inizia con le impostazioni di retrazione standard della tua stampante e poi esperimenta per trovare il giusto equilibrio. 5. **Raffreddamento**: Un buon flusso d'aria di raffreddamento è importante, soprattutto per filamenti con base PLA. Tuttavia, per materiali come il PETG o il Nylon, potresti dover ridurre la velocità della ventola o disattivarla per i primi strati per migliorare l'adesione al letto. 6. **Lettiera**: L'uso di un letto riscaldato può aiutare a migliorare l'adesione. Le temperature del letto possono variare a seconda del materiale di base del filamento. Ad esempio, per il PLA rinforzato, una temperatura del letto di circa 60°C è un buon punto di partenza, mentre per il PETG potrebbe essere necessario impostare il letto a circa 80°C. Ricorda che questi sono solo punti di partenza e potrebbero dover essere adattati a seconda del tuo ambiente di stampa specifico, del tipo di filamento e delle preferenze personali. Sarà utile eseguire alcuni test di stampa e regolare le impostazioni di conseguenza. Inoltre, dato che menzioni l'utilizzo del software fornito con la stampante, \\"Creative\\", non hai specificato quale software sia esattamente. Molti utilizzatori di Ender 3 V2 trovano che Cura (un software di slicing gratuito e ampiamente utilizzato) offre molte opzioni di personalizzazione che possono aiutare a ottimizzare ulteriormente la stampa. Assicurati di controllare se il software che stai utilizzando ti permette di modificare tutti questi parametri."},{"instruction":"mi scrivi le impostazioni per creativ print","output":"Al momento del mio ultimo aggiornamento nel 2023, \\"Creative Print\\" non è tra i software di slicing più comunemente menzionati o documentati, come ad esempio Cura, Simplify3D, o PrusaSlicer. Tuttavia, le impostazioni generali che ho fornito nella risposta precedente possono essere applicate alla maggior parte dei software di slicing con alcune modifiche basate sulla terminologia specifica o sulla disposizione delle impostazioni nel software che stai utilizzando. Per applicare queste impostazioni generali in qualsiasi software di slicing, incluso \\"Creative Print\\", se esiste, dovrai cercare le sezioni corrispondenti all'interno del software per modificare i parametri. Ecco una guida generale su cosa cercare e dove potresti inserire le impostazioni consigliate: 1. **Temperatura di Estrusione/Ugello:** Questa impostazione si trova di solito nelle impostazioni relative al materiale o al filamento. Cerca un'opzione che ti permetta di specificare la temperatura dell'ugello o dell'estruzione. 2. **Velocità di Stampa:** Spesso trovata sotto le opzioni di stampa o velocità, questa impostazione ti permette di controllare quanto velocemente si muove l'estruitore durante la stampa. Per i filamenti rinforzati con carbonio, potresti volerla impostare su un valore più basso per iniziare, come 40-50 mm/s. 3. **Altezza dello Strato:** Questa è spesso una delle prime impostazioni che puoi trovare quando configuri il profilo di qualità della stampa. Modificare l'altezza dello strato influenzerà la risoluzione della stampa e l'aspetto della superficie. 4. **Retrazione:** Questa impostazione è importante per prevenire le stringhe tra le parti stampate. Si trova spesso sotto le impostazioni della testa di stampa o estrusione e include opzioni per la distanza e la velocità di retrazione. 5. **Raffreddamento:** Le impostazioni del ventilatore di raffreddamento sono di solito raggruppate con altre impostazioni di stampa. Qui puoi controllare se il ventilatore è attivo e a che velocità deve funzionare durante la stampa. 6. **Temperatura del Letto di Stampa:** Se la tua stampante ha un letto riscaldato, le impostazioni per la temperatura del letto si trovano spesso nelle impostazioni del materiale o all'inizio del processo di configurazione della stampa. Se non riesci a trovare queste impostazioni in \\"Creative Print\\" o se hai bisogno di ulteriore assistenza specifica per questo software, ti consiglio di consultare il manuale utente fornito con il software o cercare guide online. La comunità di stampa 3D spesso fornisce ottime risorse e assistenza per software specifici."},{"instruction":"réalise un script bash qui permet de créer et inserts : voici l'arborescence C:. │ AbcDatalog-0.5.0.jar │ MCD.svg │ parcours.sql │ RAPPORT_SAE.pdf │ README.md │ ├───3.2 │ 3-2_crea.sql │ 3-2_delete.sql │ 3-2_request.sql │ 3.2.md │ ├───3.3 │ crea.sql │ delete.sql │ request.sql │ └───assets ├───bd │ mocodo.PNG │ └───datalog 2.PNG 3.PNG 4.PNG 5.PNG","output":"Pour créer un script Bash qui crée l'arborescence de fichiers et de dossiers décrite, avec des inserts d'exemple dans certains fichiers, suivez les étapes ci-dessous.

They decide to hop on it to see where it takes them. Nick tells the Nyan Cat to go...uh...whereever Moana takes place in, and so the Nyan Cat blasts off...to Arendelle from Frozen. Judy and Nick, upon realizing the cold setting instead of the tropical one, ends up complaining to the Nyan Cat, and it ends up taking them back home. Nick then gives the Nyan Cat a bad Yelp review.","output":"On a bright and bustling day in Zootopia, Officer Judy Hopps, the city's first rabbit police officer, was patrolling the streets with her clever and cunning partner, Nick Wilde, a reformed fox con artist. As they navigated through the diverse and bustling neighborhoods of the metropolis, their attention was suddenly captured by an extraordinary sight. Descending from the clear blue sky was a vibrant creature unlike anything they’d witnessed before— a cat with a body made of a rainbow, propelling itself forward through the air with a trail of sparkling stars and a catchy, muffled melody surrounding it. The sight of the legendary Nyan Cat in the flesh—or rather, in the pixels—left them both wide-eyed and open-mouthed. Nick, ever the adventurous spirit, grinned at Judy with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. \\"Carrots, how about we take a little detour?” he suggested, with excitement bubbling in his voice. \\"I mean, when are we ever going to get another chance to ride a meme through the sky?” Judy, initially hesitant due to her strong commitment to responsibility, couldn’t help but be swayed by the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With a determined nod, she agreed. \\"Alright, Nick, let's do it. But right after, we get straight back to patrol.\\" Agreeing to the terms, they approached the Nyan Cat, which seemed to pause and hover just above ground as if it had been waiting for them. With a leap, they hopped onto the fabled creature. Nick, feeling a sense of control in this utterly bizarre situation, called out, \\"Alright, mystical feline bakery product of the skies, take us to... uh, wherever Moana takes place!\\" To their amazement, the Nyan Cat obeyed, blasting off instantly. However, instead of the warmth of the sun and the salt of the ocean greeting them, they were met with a brisk, chilly wind and the sight of endless snow. They had landed, quite unexpectedly, in Arendelle, the kingdom renowned for its eternal winter, brought to life in the tales of Queen Elsa and her magical icy powers. Both Judy and Nick, dressed in their Zootopia-standard uniforms, were utterly unprepared for the snow and cold. Judy, shivering, turned to Nick with a look that mixed disbelief with a slight annoyance. \\"Nick, I’m pretty sure this isn't where Moana takes place.\\" Nick, trying to shake off the cold, sheepishly grinned. \\"Heh, looks like our furry GPS needs an update. Or maybe it just prefers musicals about ice rather than water.\\" Making their feelings known with a series of complaints about the unexpected detour, they urged the Nyan Cat to take them back to Zootopia right away. Sensing their discomfort, or perhaps tiring of their grievances, the Nyan Cat complied, turning back towards the direction from which they came. The return journey felt even quicker, perhaps due to the urgency of their request or maybe because the magical creature had grown accustomed to their presence. Back in the familiar surroundings of Zootopia, with the warmth of the sun thawing their chilled bones, Judy and Nick hopped off the Nyan Cat. They shared a look, a mix of disbelief and exhilaration at the unplanned adventure they had just experienced. Nick, taking out his phone, started tapping away with his quick fox fingers. \\"I'm giving our otherworldly taxi a review,\\" he announced, his eyes glinting with mischief once again. Judy, curious, peered over his shoulder to read what he was writing. \\"One star. Asked for Moana, got Frozen. Magnificent ride, but doesn't follow directions. Would not recommend if you have a specific destination in mind.\\" As they watched the Nyan Cat ascend into the sky once more, leaving a rainbow trail in its wake, Judy couldn't help but laugh, her earlier frustrations melting away. \\"Only you, Nick, would give a magical flying cat a bad Yelp review.\\" Nick wrapped an arm around her shoulders as they started walking back to continue their patrol. \\"Well, Judy, it's all about honest feedback, right? Who knows, maybe next time it'll get someone where they actually want to go.\\" Together, they walked back into the heart of Zootopia, the city they both loved and protected. Their detour to Arendelle, courtesy of the Nyan Cat, would forever be a story they’d share, a reminder of the unpredictability of life and the adventures that lay in wait, even, or especially, for a dedicated bunny officer and her wily fox partner."},{"instruction":"Write a descriptive, fictional, imaginative, humorous screenplay of Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami, and Asuka Langley playing No Man's Sky. Part 1, planet that looks like Shinji","output":"Title: Virtual Misadventures in No Man's Sky FADE IN: INT. NERV RECREATION ROOM - DAY A bank of computers and gaming consoles are neatly arranged in the room. The atmosphere teems with the hum of electronics and the faint echo of interstellar sound effects. SHINJI IKARI, REI AYANAMI, and ASUKA LANGLEY SORYU are seated in front of a large screen, each with a game controller in hand, their expressions a mixture of concentration and uncertainty. SHINJI (awkwardly) So, we're just supposed to explore space and...find stuff? ASUKA (rolling her eyes) It's called \\"No Man's Sky,\\" dummy. We explore, gather resources, and try not to die. Even you should be able to handle that. REI (flatly) Our collaboration will increase our probability of survival. The game screen shows a spaceship entering the atmosphere of a strange planet. The landscape below is startlingly familiar - it resembles SHINJI'S FACE, complete with two large craters for eyes and a mountain range that forms a semblance of a frown. ASUKA (squinting at the screen) Is it just me, or does that planet look like... SHINJI (horrified) Me?! The spaceship lands on the 'nose' of the planet. The trio exits their ship, their in-game avatars looking small against the backdrop of Shinji's planetary visage. SHINJI This is so weird. Is the game supposed to do this? REI It is unlikely. The procedural generation should not have access to our personal data. ASUKA (looking around) Let's just get this over with. We need resources, and Shinji's face is as good a place as any to start. The trio sets about exploring the planet, picking up resources like ‘Shinjium’ and ‘Ikaronite.’ As they travel, they encounter strange creatures that resemble exaggerated aspects of Shinji's personality; timid critters that run away when approached, and melancholic flora that wilt if not constantly attended to. SHINJI (watching a creature flee) I don't know whether to be offended or amused. ASUKA (snorting) This whole planet is a cry for help. Let's find something useful and get out of here. Suddenly, their scanners pick up a distress signal emanating from a nearby cave, shaped eerily like Shinji’s ear. The trio cautiously makes their way toward it. INT.

ASUKA (scowling at a projection) Great, now the planet is psychoanalyzing us. REI (looking intrigued by her projection) This could serve as a practical self-diagnostic tool. SHINJI (trying to ignore the projections) Let’s just find the source of that signal. They find an alien artifact at the center of the cave, pulsing gently. The moment Shinji touches it, the projections vanish, and a chest of rare resources appears. REI Objective achieved. ASUKA (walking out) Let's get off this weirdo planet. Next time, let's land on one that looks like me. It'd be way less depressing. SHINJI (mutters) Or twice as narcissistic... CUT TO: EXT.

ASUKA (excited) That one! It has to be mine. It's practically screaming \\"Asuka Langley!\\" REI (analyzing) The color scheme does appear... aggressive. SHINJI (tentatively) Let's just hope it's not as literal as the last one. They pilot the spaceship toward the planet, which, upon closer inspection, does indeed seem to embody an essence of Asuka. There are vast deserts with dunes shaped like her signature hair clips and raging volcanoes that mimic her fiery temperament. EXT. ASUKA PLANET - DAY The ship lands on a flat expanse near a vast ocean, the surface shimmering with a golden hue. The trio disembarks, eager to explore this new world. ASUKA (beaming) See? This is more like it. A planet with some proper style! As they venture further, they encounter creatures that range from fiercely independent predators that hunt in solitude to small, competitive packs that vie for dominance - mirroring Asuka’s complex personality. SHINJI (pointing at a creature) That one looks like it could be your pet, Asuka. The creature, resembling a small dragon with Asuka's fiery hair colors, hisses defiantly at Shinji before scampering off. ASUKA (smirking) It's got spirit. I like it. Their exploration leads them to a vast canyon where echoes carry far and wide. Asuka, unable to resist, yells into the void, her voice reverberating in a chorus of vented frustrations and dreams. REI (observing) This planet facilitates emotional expression. SHINJI (nodding) Yeah, it's therapeutic, in an Asuka kind of way. They soon discover a hidden cave with walls that glow warmly, the light shifting in intensity as if breathing. The cave is filled with crystals identical in color to Asuka's eyes. At the heart of this cave, they find an artifact similar to the one on Shinji’s planet. Touching it causes the cave to light up brilliantly, revealing a cache of rare resources and a detailed map of the galaxy highlighting potential alliances and conflicts among star systems. ASUKA (awed) It's like... it understands what matters to me. REI It appears that confronting these planets allows us to collect valuable resources and insights. SHINJI (looking hopeful) Maybe the universe isn't as cold and empty as it seems. They exit the cave, their spirits lifted by the discovery, and make their way back to the ship.

REI (serenely) A planet that transcends the limitations of individual self. ASUKA (snorts) That sounds about as vague as Rei herself.

Hesitantly, they step through it and are transported to a vast underwater city, bathed in a serene blue light that filters down from above. ASUKA (amazed) This is... incredible. The city is abandoned but maintained, with signs of a past civilization everywhere. As they explore, they come across murals depicting beings of light living in harmony, merging and separating with ease, a society without individualism, existing as part of a greater whole. REI (softly) Unity in diversity. Separation is an illusion. Their exploration leads them to a central dome where they find another alien artifact. As soon as Rei touches it, the city lights up, and the whole water around them starts to shimmer with vibrant colors, revealing hidden paths and gateways to other worlds. SHINJI (awestruck) It's like we unlocked the soul of the planet... The artifact bestows upon them a blueprint for technology that allows mental and emotional connectivity among individuals, reflecting Rei's intrinsic nature of seeking connection and understanding. ASUKA (grinning) Looks like we hit the jackpot again. REI (serene) These discoveries... they bring us closer, not just to the stars, but to each other. They exit the underwater city, feeling a profound sense of unity and companionship, the glowing pathways illuminating their return to the surface. CUT TO: EXT. REI'S PLANET - SHORE - DAY Back on the surface, the trio takes a moment to look out over the ocean, contemplating the deep connections they've discovered - within themselves and amongst each other. ASUKA (teasingly) So, who's planet next? We've run out of pilots. SHINJI (smiling) Maybe we don't need another planet. We’ve already found something pretty valuable right here.

Полки хорошие и даже ещё добротные. Могу ли я их забрать на дачу, огородить ими грядки?","output":"В принципе, во многих местах нет прямых законодательных ограничений на забор вещей, брошенных на помойку, особенно если они выставлены рядом с мусорным контейнером, а не внутри его. Это может рассматриваться как изъятие ненужных вещей, идущих на выброс, что не влечет за собой юридической ответственности. Однако есть несколько важных моментов, которые следует учесть: 1. **Законодательство и местные положения**: В разных регионах могут действовать свои правила, касающиеся забора вещей со свалок или мусорных баков. Поэтому имеет смысл проверить местные законы и регулирования, чтобы избежать возможных проблем. 2. **Частная собственность и разрешение**: Если помойка находится на частной территории, например, территории соседнего дома, может потребоваться получить разрешение от владельца или управляющей компании на забор вещей. Забор без разрешения может трактоваться как нарушение частной собственности или даже воровство. 3. **Состояние вещей**: Убедитесь, что вещи действительно подходят для вторичного использования и не представляют опасности. Иногда вещи выбрасывают из-за их плохого состояния или потенциального вреда. 4. **Чистота и гигиена**: Помните о вопросах гигиены и безопасности. Вещи, взятые с мусорных точек, могут требовать тщательной очистки и дезинфекции. Если учесть вышеуказанные пункты и подойти к вопросу с умом и ответственностью, то использование найденных дверок и полок для огораживания грядок на даче может оказаться хорошей идеей по переработке и вторичному использованию ресурсов."},{"instruction":"Я увидел, как кто-то выбросил старые дверки и полки от кухонного шкафа на помойку моего дома (он в открытом доступе), положив рядом с мусорным контейнером. Полки хорошие и даже ещё добротные. Могу ли я их забрать на дачу, огородить ими грядки?","output":"Да, вы можете забрать брошенные дверки и полки для использования на вашей даче. В такой ситуации, когда предметы уже выброшены и оставлены без внимания рядом с мусорным контейнером, они обычно считаются отходами, которые уже не принадлежат кому-либо. В большинстве случаев нет никаких юридических ограничений, запрещающих вам забрать эти вещи для личного пользования, если только они не занимают пространство, предназначенное для чужой собственности, или не создают помехи другим. Однако, всегда полезно действовать с учетом некоторых моментов: 1. **Убедитесь, что вещи действительно были выброшены**. Иногда люди временно оставляют вещи рядом с контейнерами с намерением вернуться за ними позже. Если есть возможность, попытайтесь удостовериться, что предметы действительно предназначены для утилизации. 2. **Проверьте состояние**. Вы уже убедились, что полки в хорошем состоянии, но стоит также убедиться, что они не содержат вредных веществ или не являются опасными (например, не покрыты плесенью или грибком). 3. **Будьте аккуратны при транспортировке**. Удостоверьтесь, что у вас есть подходящие средства для перевозки таких габаритных предметов, чтобы они не создавали препятствий или опасности на дороге. 4. **Эстетический и функциональный контроль**. Подумайте, как эти вещи будут смотреться на вашей даче и насколько они будут функциональны для задуманного использования. В общем, переиспользование и рециклирование — это прекрасный способ уменьшить количество отходов и дать вторую жизнь полезным вещам. Если все вышеуказанные пункты учтены, и вы чувствуете, что дверки и полки будут полезны для вас, не вижу препятствий для их использования на вашей даче."},{"instruction":"I saw how someone threw the old doors and shelves from the kitchen cabinet into the trash of my house (it is in the public domain), putting it next to the dumpster. The shelves are good and even still sound. Can I take them to the cottage, fence the beds with them?","output":"Yes, you can repurpose the old doors and shelves from the kitchen cabinet for your cottage, including using them to fence the beds. Reusing and repurposing materials is a great way to reduce waste and contribute to a more sustainable environment. Before proceeding, here are some points to consider: 1. **Legal Aspect:** Since the items were discarded and placed in a public domain area next to your trash, they are generally considered abandoned property. However, laws and regulations regarding taking discarded items can vary by location. In most cases, taking items that have been clearly thrown away is legal, but it's always a good idea to check local regulations. 2. **Safety and Cleanliness:** Ensure that the doors and shelves are safe to use, especially around areas where you may be growing food. They should be free from mold, chemicals, or anything harmful. Cleaning them properly before use is also a good practice. 3. **Adaptation for Use:** Depending on the material of the doors and shelves, you might need to treat or modify them to withstand outdoor conditions, especially if they will be exposed to the elements. Some kitchen cabinets may not be made to endure rain, sun, or soil contact without additional protection like weather-resistant paint or sealant. 4. **Aesthetic Consideration:** Consider how the repurposed doors and shelves will look when used as fencing for the beds. With a bit of creativity, they can not only be functional but also add a unique aesthetic to your cottage garden. 5. **Integration with the Garden Layout:** Plan how you will integrate these materials into your garden. Think about the size of the beds, the height of the barriers you want to create, and how you will secure the doors and shelves in place. This repurposing project is a smart way to recycle materials, save money, and add character to your cottage. With some careful planning and a bit of effort, you can transform these discarded items into a functional and attractive part of your garden."},{"instruction":"красиво написать спокойной ночи","output":"Пусть ночь окутает тебя своим волшебным покоем, а сны пригласят в мир чудес и безмятежности.

Вот некоторые из них: 1. **Шифр Цезаря** - метод шифрования путем сдвига букв алфавита на определённое число позиций. 2. **Шифр Виженера** - способ полиалфавитного шифрования, использующий таблицу или квадрат Виженера для замены элементов исходного текста. 3. **Шифр Плейфера** - метод шифрования, при котором буквы исходного сообщения шифруются парами в соответствии с их расположением в специальной таблице. 4. **Шифр Вернама** (или одноразовый блокнот) - система шифрования, в которой ключ шифрования, используемый один раз, имеет такую же длину, как и зашифрованное сообщение. 5. **RSA** - алгоритм асимметричного шифрования, который использует два ключа: открытый и закрытый. Известен своей надежностью и широко используется в интернете для защиты данных. 6. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** - симметричный алгоритм блочного шифрования, принятый в качестве стандарта шифрования правительством США. 7. **Шифр Энигмы** - комплексная система шифрования, использовавшаяся нацистской Германией во время Второй мировой войны. Энигма была портативным электромеханическим шифровальным устройством, которое шифровало вводимые буквенные сообщения с помощью серии вращающихся дисков. 8. **Стеганография** - не столько шифр, сколько метод скрытия самого факта передачи зашифрованной информации, например, в картинках или аудиофайлах. 9. **Квантовое шифрование** - передовой метод шифрования, использующий принципы квантовой механики для обеспечения безопасности коммуникаций. Особенно важен такой метод квантового распределения ключей. Шифры бывают симметричные и асимметричные. В симметричных шифрах используется один и тот же ключ для шифрования и дешифровки данных. В асимметричных шифрах используются два ключа: один для шифрования (публичный ключ), а другой для дешифровки (приватный ключ). Это лишь некоторые примеры; на самом деле существует множество различных шифров и методов криптографии, каждый из которых имеет свои уникальные характеристики и области применения."},{"instruction":"С помощью какого шифра можно закодировать слово pavel если в зашифрованном виде первая буква слова будет w , а третья b","output":"Чтобы зашифровать слово \\"pavel\\", так чтобы первая буква в зашифрованном виде стала \\"w\\", а третья буква \\"b\\", можно использовать шифр Цезаря, который является простым шифром сдвига. В шифре Цезаря каждая буква исходного текста заменяется буквой, находящейся на фиксированное число позиций левее или правее её в алфавите. Давайте попробуем определить, какой сдвиг потребуется в данном случае. Исходно: - \\"p\\" должно стать \\"w\\". - \\"a\\" должно стать \\"b\\". Для \\"p\\" -> \\"w\\", в английском алфавите необходим сдвиг на 7 позиций вперёд (p -> q -> r -> s -> t -> u -> v -> w). Проверим, подходит ли такой же сдвиг для преобразования \\"a\\" в \\"b\\": - \\"a\\" сдвиг на 1 позицию вперёд даст нам \\"b\\", что соответствует условию.

The showdown with the Night King should be more than a physical battle. Let's craft it as a climactic confrontation between ice and fire, with Bran’s warging abilities playing a crucial role in revealing the Night King’s vulnerabilities. **Sansa Stark:** Cersei’s end needs reworking too. Her cunning and resilience have been her trademarks. Her exit should reflect her complexity as a character, perhaps through a final play for power that backfires. **Jon Snow:** Jaime’s arc deserves a better conclusion as well. His redemptive journey should not lead him back to Cersei in the end. Instead, let’s have him play a pivotal role in the final battle, ensuring his transformation is acknowledged and his legacy, honored. **Sansa Stark:** And let’s not forget the Iron Throne itself. Destroying it should symbolize the end of the old order, the cycle of violence and tyranny. The one who ends the rule should be someone who understands the cost of power but is hesitant to wield it themselves. **Jon Snow:** For the North and the Seven Kingdoms, independence or unity should come through a council, emphasizing democracy over conquest or birthright. Sansa could lead the North, emphasizing her growth into a capable leader who prioritizes her people’s welfare. **Sansa Stark:** Perfect. Lastly, we need to ensure the logistical details of battles and strategies are plausible. No more overlooked fleets or undefended strongholds. Every military action should reflect the tactical acumen the show was known for. **Jon Snow:** Agreed. Let’s revise the scripts with these adjustments, keeping in mind our overarching goal: to deliver a satisfying, coherent conclusion that resonates with the depth and complexity *Game of Thrones* is celebrated for. **[Scene: Jon and Sansa, reinvigorated by their shared vision, begin to rewrite the season’s scripts. Their dedication to preserving the essence of the story, while weaving in these crucial adjustments, is evident in their focused discussions and the rapid filling of whiteboard space with new ideas. Season 8 is reborn, promising a finale that is as thoughtful as it is thrilling.]**"},{"instruction":"know any programs that hedged his bitcoin buys with short selling?","output":"Programs or strategies that hedge Bitcoin buys with short selling can encompass a diverse range of tactics, often tailored to the risk tolerance and objectives of the investor or trader implementing them. Hedging is a strategy designed to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. In the case of Bitcoin, one may hedge their long positions (buys) with short selling to mitigate potential losses if the price of Bitcoin falls. The specific tools and platforms utilized for hedging with short selling include: 1. **Derivative Exchanges**: Platforms like BitMEX, Deribit, and OKEx allow users to enter into futures contracts or options that can be used to hedge positions. For instance, if you hold Bitcoin but are concerned about a potential price drop, you can buy put options or enter into a futures contract that gains in value as Bitcoin's price falls, thus offsetting the loss in your long position. 2. **CFD Brokers**: Contracts for Difference (CFDs) are another vehicle through which investors can hedge their Bitcoin holdings. Platforms like eToro or Plus500 offer cryptocurrency CFDs that enable traders to open short positions on Bitcoin, without owning the underlying asset. This can be a straightforward way to balance one's exposure to Bitcoin price movements. 3. **Traditional Financial Instruments**: For more institutional investors or those with access to sophisticated financial products, there might be options to use traditional financial instruments like Bitcoin futures offered on CME as a hedging tool. This requires a significant understanding of the futures market and may involve more substantial capital. 4. **Automated Trading Platforms and Bots**: Some traders use automated trading systems or bots, which can implement hedging strategies by dynamically entering and exiting positions based on predefined criteria. Platforms like 3Commas or Haasonline allow traders to design or use existing algorithms that can hedge Bitcoin positions by taking short positions automatically, based on market conditions. 5. **DeFi Platforms and Protocols**: In the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, there are innovative solutions for hedging, including decentralized options and futures platforms where users can take positions to hedge their Bitcoin exposure. Protocols like Hegic or Synthetix can be utilized for creating synthetic assets or options that serve hedging purposes. Remember, while hedging can protect against losses, it also involves its own set of risks and costs. The effectiveness of a hedging strategy depends on multiple factors, including the structure of the hedge, fees, and the precise timing of trades. Moreover, it's crucial to conduct thorough research or seek professional advice when considering complex strategies like hedging with short sales. Technology and market conditions evolve, so staying informed about the latest tools and best practices is vital."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],O={key:0},j={key:1};function L(i,e,l,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
