Draw the altitude of triangle PQR from R (the highest point) to V on PQ (crossing LM at W) and extend it through to U.  By the scaling factor, we identify that UV = 0.5 cdot RP, where RP is the length of the altitude. The geometry follows: 1.

Let's consider a number ( N ). 2. We need to split ( N ) into two parts such that their product is maximized.    Let one part be ( x ), and the other part be ( N - x ).     3. The product of these two parts is given by:    [    P = x(N - x) = xN - x^2    ]     4. To maximize ( P ), we need to find the critical points by setting the derivative of ( P ) with respect to ( x ) to zero.    [    frac{dP}{dx} = frac{d}{dx}(xN - x^2) = N - 2x    ]     5. Set ( frac{dP}{dx} = 0 ) and solve for ( x ):    [    N - 2x = 0 implies x = frac{N}{2}    ]     6.

Let’s consider arranging some circles in a hexagonal pattern, as hexagons provide a close-packing structure that is optimal for such arrangements. 3. **Hexagon Arrangement Analysis:**     - Consider the arrangement of 6 circles with centers located at the vertices of a regular hexagon inscribed inside the unit circle ( S ).      - The side length of this hexagon is exactly 1 since each vertex of the hexagon lies on the circumference of ( S ).     - The radius of each of these 6 circles of radius 1 extends beyond the unit circle ( S ) and intersects ( S ), but without containing ( S )'s center. 4. **Further Analysis:**     - Besides these 6 circles, we can fit additional circles outside the unit circle ( S ) but still intersecting ( S ) and not containing the center of ( S ).     - We place additional circles with centers at the vertices of squares constructed on the sides of the inscribed hexagon. These squares will each have circles of radius 1, with their centers falling outside ( S ). 5. **Maximum Number Calculation:**     - This pattern allows us to place 6 (from the hexagon vertices) + 12 (from the square vertices) = 18 circles of radius 1 intersecting ( S ) without containing the center of ( S ) or each other’s centers.      6. **Proof of Impossibility Beyond 18 Circles:**     - Assume hypothetically that we could place more than 18 circles. For this condition to hold, we would have more than 20 points (including the center of ( S ) and the centers of all additional circles) contained within a circle of radius 2 on a plane.     - However, from the problem statement, we know that in such a case, the minimal distance between any two points must still be at least 1. 7. **Theoretical validation:**      - Reference problem 48: it provides that it’s impossible for such a configuration of more than 20 points to maintain the minimum distance condition.     - With 18 circles, you achieve the maximum arrangement without violating the minimum distance condition.

Now, if Marvin practiced M problems today, Arvin, who practices twice as many, would have practiced 2M problems today. The total number of problems practiced by both of them today and yesterday is 480. So we can write the equation: Marvin's yesterday + Marvin's today + Arvin's yesterday + Arvin's today = Total 40 + M + 80 + 2M = 480 Combining like terms, we get: 3M + 120 = 480 Subtracting 120 from both sides, we get: 3M = 480 - 120 3M = 360 Dividing both sides by 3, we get: M = 360 / 3 M = 120 So, Marvin practiced 120 math problems today.

Let's select face ABC of the tetrahedron ABCD and project faces ABD, ACD, and BCD onto the plane containing ABC. 3. **Area Comparison through Projection:**    The projection of a face on a plane is always smaller than or equal to the area of the face itself, due to the cosine term introduced by the angle of projection. Mathematically, if we denote:    - T_{ABD} as the area of face ABD    - T_{ACD} as the area of face ACD    - T_{BCD} as the area of face BCD    - and let alpha_1, alpha_2, alpha_3 be angles between the plane of face ABC and planes of faces ABD, ACD, and BCD, respectively, then the projected areas can be written as:      [      T_{ABD} cdot cos{alpha_1}, quad      T_{ACD} cdot cos{alpha_2}, quad      T_{BCD} cdot cos{alpha_3}      ] 4. **Summing the Projection Areas:**    When projected onto the plane of ABC, these areas can either be exactly covering ABC if the vertex D lies above it or extending beyond its borders. Regardless, the sum of these projected areas will at least cover the area of ABC. 5. **Area Inequality:**    Since the cosine of any angle (0 leq cos alpha leq 1) reduces the effective area in the plane of the projection, we have:    [    T_{ABD} cdot cos{alpha_1} + T_{ACD} cdot cos{alpha_2} + T_{BCD} cdot cos{alpha_3} leq T_{ABD} + T_{ACD} + T_{BCD}    ]    This actual sum of projected areas, which covers the area of ABC, must be less than or equal to the complete areas of the faces from which they are projected.

This means that the number of married women is 0.7704918032786885 * 0.61E. Now, let's calculate the number of married women: Married Women = 0.7704918032786885 * 0.61E Married Women = 0.4702E (approximately) Since the total number of married employees is 0.60E, the number of married men would be the difference between the total number of married employees and the number of married women: Married Men = Total Married - Married Women Married Men = 0.60E - 0.4702E Married Men = 0.1298E (approximately) Now, since 61 percent of the employees are women, the remaining 39 percent must be men: Men = 0.39E If 0.1298E of these men are married, then the number of single men is the difference between the total number of men and the number of married men: Single Men = Total Men - Married Men Single Men = 0.39E - 0.1298E Single Men = 0.2602E (approximately) To find the fraction of men who are single, we divide the number of single men by the total number of men: Fraction of Single Men = Single Men / Total Men Fraction of Single Men = 0.2602E / 0.39E When we divide both the numerator and the denominator by E, we get: Fraction of Single Men = 0.2602 / 0.39 Now, let's calculate the fraction: Fraction of Single Men ≈ 0.6671794871794872 So, approximately boxed{66.72}  percent of the men are single."},{"instruction":"Given that the function f(x) = frac{ax+b}{x^2+1} is an odd function defined on (1,1) and f(1) = 1.

Differentiating f(x) with respect to x gives:  f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{2x}{x^2+1}right)  Using the quotient rule (left(frac{u}{v}right)' = frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}), where u = 2x and v = x^2+1, we find that:  f'(x) = frac{2(x^2+1) - 2x(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2} = frac{2 - 2x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}  For x in (-1, 1), -1 < x < 1 implies that -x^2 > -1, hence 2 - 2x^2 > 2 - 2(1) = 0.

Since ( S ) is the maximum value among ( S_1, S_2, S_3, ) and ( S_4 ), we know: [ S_i leq S quad(i=1, 2, 3, 4) ] 2. Summing these inequalities results in: [ sum_{i=1}^4 S_i leq 4S ] 3. Dividing both sides by (S) gives us: [ lambda = frac{sum_{i=1}^4 S_i}{S} leq 4 ] Thus, (lambda) cannot exceed 4. Let's now check the lower bound for (lambda). 4. Specifically, when the tetrahedron is regular (a regular tetrahedron), all faces are congruent. Therefore, we have: [ S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = S_4 = S  ] In this case, [ sum_{i=1}^4 S_i = 4S  ] Hence, [ lambda = frac{4S}{S} = 4 ] which shows that for a regular tetrahedron, (lambda) can achieve the value 4.  5. Next, let's consider if (lambda) can have a value less than 4 but greater than 2. We note that for a general tetrahedron, (cos 45^{circ} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) can be realized under certain configurations. 6. Consider the case where the planes forming the tetrahedron create dihedral angles of (45^circ). In such a configuration, let (S_4) be the base, and given the cosine relation mentioned above, the equation can be expressed as: [ S = S_4 = left(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 right) cos 45^{circ} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (S_1 + S_2 + S_3) ] Solving this, we have: [ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = sqrt{2} S ] 7. Summing over all four faces: [ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 = sqrt{2} S + S = (1 + sqrt{2}) S ] Thus, [ lambda = frac{(1 + sqrt{2}) S}{S} = 1 + sqrt{2} ] Since ( 1+sqrt{2} < 2.5 ), it implies: [ lambda = 1 + sqrt{2} < 2.5 ] 8.

Points X and Y are on sides AB and CD, respectively, such that AX = CY. Since angle AXP = angle YPC = 45 degrees, triangles APX and CPY are isosceles right triangles. This means that PX = AX and PY = CY. Since PX = PY (radii of circles C1 and C2), and AX = CY, we have PX = PY = AX = CY. Now, let's find the length of PX and PY. Since APX is an isosceles right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find PX: PX^2 + PX^2 = AP^2 2PX^2 = AP^2 PX^2 = (AP^2) / 2 Since AP is half the side of the square (because P is the midpoint of AC, a diagonal of the square), we have: AP = AC / 2 = sqrt(2) * AB / 2 = sqrt(2) * 6000 / 2 = 3000 * sqrt(2) Plugging this into the equation for PX, we get: PX^2 = (3000 * sqrt(2))^2 / 2 PX^2 = 2 * 3000^2 / 2 PX^2 = 3000^2 PX = 3000 Now we know that PX = PY = 3000.

From this, we can solve for A: begin{align*} sqrt{3} cos A &= sin A  tan A &= frac{1}{sqrt{3}}  A &= arctanfrac{1}{sqrt{3}}  A &= dfrac{pi}{3}. end{align*} Further, applying the law of sines to the condition a cos B + b cos A = c sin C and considering that sin (A + B) = sin C, we get: sin A cos B + sin B cos A = sin^2 C. Now from the fact that A = dfrac{pi}{3} and triangle ABC is a triangle (hence A + B + C = pi), we can deduce that: begin{align*} C &= pi - A - B    &= pi - dfrac{pi}{3} - B    &= dfrac{2pi}{3} - B. end{align*} Since sin^2 C + cos^2 C = 1, we have sin^2 (dfrac{2pi}{3} - B) + cos^2 (dfrac{2pi}{3} - B) = 1. Using the identity cos (2pi/3 - B) = -cos (B + pi/3) and sin (2pi/3 - B) = sin (B + pi/3), we can rewrite the equation as: sin left(B + dfrac{pi}{3}right) cos B + sin B cos left(dfrac{pi}{3}right) = sin^2 left(B + dfrac{pi}{3}right). sin left(B + dfrac{pi}{3}right) = sin^2 left(B + dfrac{pi}{3}right). To solve for sin(B + pi/3), we must have a special angle for which sin theta = (sin theta)^2. The only time this is true for 0 leq theta leq pi is when theta = dfrac{pi}{6}, which leads to sin theta = 1/2. Thus, B + dfrac{pi}{3} = dfrac{pi}{6}, which simplifies to B = dfrac{pi}{6} - dfrac{pi}{3} = -dfrac{pi}{6}. However, an angle cannot be negative in a triangle, so we reconsider our solution. We made a mistake in the last steps. The correct equation from sin(C) = sin^2(C) should be: begin{align*} sin left(dfrac{2pi}{3} - B right) = sin^2 left(dfrac{2pi}{3} - B right). end{align*} Since C cannot be dfrac{pi}{2} due to A being nonzero and positive, we can ignore the sin^2 C case and instead concentrate on sin(C) = 0, which implies C = pi or C = 0. Since C must be the third angle in a triangle with A already dfrac{pi}{3}, C cannot be pi or 0. Thus, we realize our approach is incorrect.  Instead, we should return to the sine law a cos B + b cos A = c sin C and factor in our known value of A = dfrac{pi}{3}. We get: begin{align*} a cos B + b cos left(dfrac{pi}{3}right) &= c sin C  a cos B + frac{b}{2} &= c sin C. end{align*} Using the fact that a sin A = b sin B = c sin C (from the law of sines), we find: begin{align*} c sin A cos B + frac{b}{2} &= c sin C  c sin left(dfrac{pi}{3}right) cos B + frac{b}{2} &= c sin left(dfrac{pi}{3}right)  frac{sqrt{3}}{2}  c cos B + frac{b}{2} &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} c. end{align*} Isolating for cos B, we have: cos B = 1 - frac{b}{sqrt{3} c}. We need cos B = 1 for cos B leq 1. This is true if b = 0 which is not possible for a triangle side length. Therefore, we must have cos B < 1 which suggests B < dfrac{pi}{2}.

The tournament for 512 wrestlers is conducted in an Olympic system: at the beginning of each day, the wrestlers are paired up, and the loser is eliminated from the competition (there are no draws). What is the highest qualification number that the winner may have?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    Consider a tournament with 512 wrestlers, each assigned a unique qualification number. When two wrestlers with qualification numbers differing by more than 2 compete, the wrestler with the lower number always wins. The tournament operates on an elimination basis, meaning one wrestler is eliminated in every match until a single winner remains. 2. **Initial Observation:**    A wrestler with number ( k ) can only lose to wrestlers with numbers ( k+1 ) or ( k+2 ). Therefore, after each round, the lowest remaining number can increase by at most 2. 3. **Calculating Maximum Possible Number for the Winner:**    The tournament has ( n = 512 ) wrestlers and follows a single-elimination format, leading to ( log_2 512 = 9 ) rounds (since ( 512 = 2^9 )).    Given that the lowest number can increase by at most 2 each round:    [    text{Maximum possible number} = 1 + 2 times 9 = 19.    ] 4. **Contradiction if Number 19 Can Win:**    - Assume wrestler number 19 could possibly win the tournament.    - In the first round, wrestlers with numbers 1 and 2 must be eliminated, meaning wrestler 1 loses to number 3, and wrestler 2 loses to number 4.    - Continuing this pattern, the final match would involve wrestlers 17 and 18, since number 19 would have to wait for the elimination of 1 through 16, which cannot happen as described.    This pattern contradicts the possibility of 19 winning because it implies both 17 and 18 will be the last wrestlers standing in the final round. Hence, number 19 cannot win. 5. **Construct Solution for Number 18 Winning:**    We explore a scenario where all \\"greater\\" numbers (greater than 18) are weaker:    - For ( k leq 8 ):      - Wrestler ( 2k-1 ) can lose to wrestler ( 2k+1 ).      - Wrestler ( 2k ) can lose to wrestler ( 2k+2 ).    - This ensures wrestlers with numbers greater than 18 (weaker wrestlers) lose early on, leaving numbers 17 and 18 to proceed through each round. 6. **Final Situation:**    After 8 rounds, the remaining wrestlers would be numbers 17 and 18.

First, let us analyze the parity (odd or even nature) of the numbers involved. We know:    - The result 11111 is an odd number.    - We need to determine if the sum of the two numbers x and y can be odd. 3. Consider the properties of odd and even numbers:    - An odd number plus an odd number is even.    - An even number plus an even number is even.    - Only an odd number plus an even number results in an odd number. 4. Suppose both x and y are even numbers:    - 7 times x and 5 times y with both x and y being even will result in both terms being even since any number multiplied by an even number results in an even number.    - The sum of two even numbers is even.    - Thus, 7x + 5y would be even which contradicts 11111 being odd. 5. Suppose both x and y are odd numbers:    - 7 times x and 5 times y with both x and y being odd will result in both terms being odd since odd number times odd number is odd.    - The sum of two odd numbers is even.    - Thus, 7x + 5y would again be even which contradicts 11111 being odd. 6. Thus, it must be the case that one of x or y is even, and the other is odd:    - If one is even and the other is odd, the substitution into 7x + 5y results in one term being odd and the other being even.    - The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd. 7. Therefore, the only possible solution for x and y that satisfies 7x + 5y = 11111 requires one number to be even and the other number to be odd.

Step 1: Analyze the Team Matches Let's consider one of the teams, denoted as A.  Step 2: Matches Played by Team A - In 8 rounds, team A has played with 8 different teams. - This means there are (18 - 1 - 8 = 9) teams with which team A has not played.  Step 3: Considering a Subset of Teams Not Played with A Let’s denote these 9 teams as (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_9). We need to check if any three teams among these 9 have not played any match among themselves.  Step 4: Check for Complete Tournament Among Remaining Teams Assume (for contradiction) that every pair among these 9 teams has played a match—this would mean these 9 teams completed a round-robin tournament among themselves.  Step 5: Calculate the Number of Matches in a Round-robin Tournament - A round-robin tournament among 9 teams requires each team to play every other team once. - The total number of such matches is given by the combination formula ( binom{9}{2} ):      [   binom{9}{2} = frac{9 cdot 8}{2} = 36   ]  Step 6: Determine the Possible Matches in 8 Rounds Each round consists of 9 matches since 18 teams are divided into pairs: [ 9 text{ matches per round} times 8 text{ rounds} = 72 text{ matches in total} ] Out of these, a maximum of 4 matches can occur per round among any selected subset of 9 teams: [ 9 left( text{teams} right)/2 = 4.5 implies 4 , text{full matches per round}. ] Thus, these 9 teams can play among themselves: [ 4 , (text{matches per round}) times 8 , (text{rounds}) = 32 text{ matches in total} ]  Step 7: Verify the Feasibility To conduct 36 matches among these 9 teams, they would have needed more than the 8 rounds (since only 32 matches could have been played among the 9 teams in these 8 rounds). Thus, we get a contradiction because only 32 matches, not 36, are possible within 8 rounds.  Conclusion Since it is not possible for all pairs among the 9 teams not played with A to have played each other, there must be at least one pair among these 9 teams that has not played any match among themselves. Consequently, this ensures that there exists a trio of teams (A, B, C) (where B, C are some of the 9 teams) that have not played any match among themselves during the 8 rounds.

According to a_7=a_6+2a_5, we can get a_6q=a_6+2frac{a_6}{q}. 3. **Solving for q**    Since a_n > 0, we can divide both sides of the equation by a_6 to get q=1+frac{2}{q}. Solving this equation gives q=2 or q=-1.

The common ratio q can be found using the formula for the n-th term of a geometric sequence: frac{a_n}{a_1} = q^{n-1}. In this case, we have two pairs of terms and their respective positions in the sequence: (a_2+1, a_2) and (a_4+1, a_4). We can use these to find q. 2.

Now that we have q, we can find a_6+1 using the formula for the n-th term of a geometric sequence again: a_n = a_1 times q^{n-1}. In this case, we want to find the sixth term of the sequence {a_{n}+1}, so we use (a_4+1) as our starting point: a_6+1 = (a_4+1) times q^{6-4} = (15+1) times 4 = 64. 4.

The sequence of units digits for powers of 3 is as follows: 1. 3^1 = 3, so the units digit is 3. 2. 3^2 = 9, so the units digit is 9. 3. 3^3 = 27, so the units digit is 7. 4. 3^4 = 81, so the units digit is 1. 5. 3^5 = 243, which brings us back to a units digit of 3, indicating the cycle repeats every 4 powers. This pattern of units digits, 3, 9, 7, 1, repeats indefinitely for powers of 3. Therefore, to find the units digit of 23^{23}, we only need to determine where 23 falls within this 4-digit cycle.

The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or repeating. 2. **Understanding Irrational Numbers:**    An irrational number cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Its decimal expansion is non-terminating and non-repeating. 3. **Determining if sqrt{2} is Rational or Irrational:**    We use a proof by contradiction to show that sqrt{2} is irrational:    - Assume sqrt{2} is rational, so sqrt{2} = frac{p}{q} where p and q are coprime integers (i.e., the fraction is in its simplest form).    - Squaring both sides, we get 2 = frac{p^2}{q^2}, or 2q^2 = p^2.    - This implies p^2 is even (since it equals 2q^2), and hence p must also be even (as the square of an odd number is odd).    - Let p = 2k for some integer k. Substituting back, we get 2q^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2, so q^2 = 2k^2.    - This implies q^2 is even, and hence q must also be even.    - However, this contradicts our initial assumption that p and q are coprime, as both are divisible by 2.    - Therefore, sqrt{2} cannot be rational. 4. **Conclusion on Decimal Expansion:**    Since sqrt{2} is irrational, its decimal expansion must be non-terminating and non-repeating.

Suppose that among the three segments connecting the vertices of the triangle to the marked points, we have ( k_1 ) segments of the first color, ( k_2 ) segments of the second color, and ( k_3 ) segments of the third color. It's given that:    [    k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 3 quad text{and} quad 0 leq k_i leq 3    ] 3. We proceed by counting the total number of segments in each color. Let’s consider the total number of segments of the first color. Every point inside the triangle has three segments of different colors converging at it. Therefore, the total number of first-color segments, counting those connecting a marked point with a vertex of the triangle is:    [    frac{n + k_1}{2}    ]    Similarly, for the second and third colors:    [    frac{n + k_2}{2} quad text{and} quad frac{n + k_3}{2}    ] 4.

The numerators of these fractions (( n + k_1, n + k_2, n + k_3 )) must all be even. Therefore, ( k_1, k_2, k_3 ) must all have the same parity (they must be all odd or all even). 6. Given that the sum ( k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 3 ), they must all be odd numbers because 3 is an odd number. The only way to achieve this is for ( k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = 1 ). 7. This configuration confirms that each vertex of the triangle is connected to a marked point by a segment of a different color. 8. We have implicitly shown that a coloring scheme where all marked points inside the triangle ensure that the segments connected to the triangle’s vertices are of different colors is valid only if the number of marked points is odd. Hence, this proves that such a coloring is impossible when the number of points is even. 9. Therefore, the segments connecting the vertices of the triangle must be colored in different colors.

Rearrange the terms to combine like terms:    [    a^2 - ab + b^2 - ab geq 0    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    a^2 - 2ab + b^2 geq 0    ] 3.

Solution: 1. **Stating the Problem for a Plane:**     - In a convex angle, for any interior point P, one can draw a line such that the segment between the arms of the angle is bisected by point P. 2. **Construction by Reflection:**      - Reflect one of the angle's arms about point P. Due to convexity, the reflected ray intersects the other arm. Let's denote this intersection point as one endpoint of the segment. 3. **Drawing the Line:**     - Connect this intersection point with P; this line will bisect the segment connecting the arms of the angle at P. 4. **Applying this Result to 3D:**     - Consider a convex polyhedral angle (hedron) formed by four rays  vec{a}, vec{b}, vec{c}, vec{d} meeting at vertex P. 5. **Construct Convex Angle Intersection:**     - Take the two convex angles formed by opposite pairs of rays. The intersection of these angles is a single ray. 6. **Selecting a Point:**     - Choose any point K on this ray. This point will act as the center of the parallelogram. 7. **Utilize Previous Result in Each Section:**     - Apply the previous 2D result to the two convex angles involving K. 8. **Formation of Parallelogram:**     - This establishes four points lying in two planes intersecting at K. The quadrilateral formed will be a parallelogram due to their symmetry from K and the midpoint property. Hence, a parallelogram cross-section is formed. # II.

From vector space theory (basis), any vector in space can be expressed as a linear combination of three non-coplanar vectors. 3. **Choosing Non-Coplanar Vectors:**     - Vectors vec{b}, vec{d}, -vec{c} are non-coplanar. Thus, alpha vec{a} can be expressed as a combination:     [     alpha vec{a} = beta vec{b} + delta vec{d} + gamma (-vec{c}).     ]      4. **Forming Equation:**     - Rearrange:     [     gamma vec{c} - delta vec{d} = beta vec{b} - alpha vec{a}.     ] 5. **Vectored Parallelism:**     - Both sides of this equation represent vectors that must be parallel.

(You may use the fact that there are  168  primes less than  1000 )","output":"1. We start by considering the factorial of a large number, specifically (2004!). The factorial (2004!) is the product of all positive integers up to (2004). This means that (2004!) is divisible by every integer from (1) to (2004). 2. Consider the sequence of numbers (2004! + 2, 2004! + 3, ldots, 2004! + 2004). Each of these numbers can be written as (2004! + k) where (2 leq k leq 2004). Since (2004!) is divisible by (k), (2004! + k) is also divisible by (k). Therefore, none of these numbers can be prime because they all have a divisor other than (1) and themselves. 3. Next, we use the given fact that there are (168) primes less than (1000). This means that in the set of the first (1000) positive integers, there are (168) primes. 4. Define (p(n)) as the number of primes in the set ({n, n+1, ldots, n+2001}). We need to show that there exists an (n) such that (p(n) = 150). 5.

We know that (p(1) geq 150) because there are (168) primes less than (1000), and the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2001}) includes all these primes. 7. We also know that (p(2004! + 2) < 150) because the set ({2004! + 2, 2004! + 3, ldots, 2004! + 2003}) contains no primes, and the number of primes in the set ({2004! + 2, 2004! + 3, ldots, 2004! + 2001}) is less than (150). 8. Since (p(n)) changes by at most (1) as (n) increases and (p(1) geq 150) while (p(2004! + 2) < 150), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some (n) in the range from (1) to (2004! + 2) such that (p(n) = 150).

(I) Find the equation of the ellipse and its eccentricity;   (II) When |BC|= frac {1}{3}|AD|, find the equation of line AB;   (III) Prove that line AC passes through the midpoint of segment EF.","output":"Solution:   (I) Let the equation of the ellipse be: frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a>b>0).   Since 2b=2, we get b=1.   Also, since overrightarrow {FE}= overrightarrow {OF}, we have begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}a^{2}-c^{2}=1  c= frac {a^{2}}{c}-c.end{matrix}right.end{cases} Solving this, we get a= sqrt {2}, c=1.   Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is: frac {x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1.   The eccentricity e= frac {c}{a}= frac { sqrt {2}}{2}.   So, the answer to part (I) is boxed{frac {x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1, e= frac { sqrt {2}}{2}}.   (II) From (I), we know the coordinates of point F are (1,0). Since the slope of line AB exists, let the slope of AB be k,   then the equation of AB is y=k(x-1).   From begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}frac {x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1  y=k(x-1)end{matrix}right.end{cases} we get (1+2k^2)x^2-4k^2x+2k^2-2=0 (*)   Let A(x_1,y_1), B(x_2,y_2), then x_1, x_2 are the two roots of equation (*), and x_1<x_2,   thus x_{1}= frac {2k^{2}- sqrt {2k^{2}+2}}{1+2k^{2}}, x_{2}= frac {2k^{2}+ sqrt {2k^{2}+2}}{1+2k^{2}}.   Since ADparallel BCparallel x-axis, and |BC|= frac {1}{3}|AD|,   we have 2- frac {2k^{2}+ sqrt {2k^{2}+2}}{1+2k^{2}}= frac {1}{3}(2- frac {2k^{2}- sqrt {2k^{2}+2}}{1+2k^{2}}), solving this gives k=±1.   Therefore, the equation of line AB is x-y-1=0 or x+y-1=0.   So, the answer to part (II) is boxed{x-y-1=0 text{ or } x+y-1=0}.   (III) Since point F(1,0), E(2,0), the midpoint N of EF has coordinates ( frac {3}{2},0).   ① When ABperp x-axis, A(1,y_1), B(1,-y_1), C(2,-y_1),   then at this time, the midpoint of AC is ( frac {3}{2},0), i.e., AC passes through the midpoint N of segment EF.   ② When AB is not perpendicular to the x-axis, then the slope of line AB exists,   let the equation of line AB be y=k(x-1),   from equation (*) we get x_{1}+x_{2}= frac {4k^{2}}{1+2k^{2}}, x_{1}x_{2}= frac {2k^{2}-2}{1+2k^{2}}.   Also, since x_{1}^2=2-2y_{1}^2<2, we have x_{1}- frac {3}{2}neq0,   thus, the slopes of lines AN, CN are respectively k_{1}= frac {y_{1}}{x_{1}- frac {3}{2}}= frac {2k(x_{1}-1)}{2x_{1}-3}, k_{2}= frac {y_{2}}{2- frac {3}{2}}=2k(x_{2}-1),   therefore k_{1}-k_{2}=2kcdot frac {(x_{1}-1)-(x_{2}-1)(2x_{1}-3)}{2x_{1}-3}.   Also, since (x_{1}-1)-(x_{2}-1)(2x_{1}-3)=3(x_{1}+x_{2})-2x_{1}x_{2}-4,   = frac {1}{1+2k^{2}}[12k^{2}-4(k^{2}-1)-4(1+2k^{2})]=0.   Therefore, k_{1}-k_{2}=0, i.e., k_{1}=k_{2}.   And since AN, CN share the common point N, thus points A, C, N are collinear.   Therefore, line AC passes through the midpoint N of segment EF.   In conclusion, line AC passes through the midpoint of segment EF.

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Initial Arrangement**: We start by arranging the books of one subject, say math books. There are 3 math books, and they can be arranged in {A}_{3}^{3} ways. Since {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6, there are 6 ways to arrange the math books. 2. **Arranging the Second Set of Books**: Now, we need to arrange the Chinese books in such a way that they are not adjacent to each other. To do this, we can place each Chinese book in the gaps between the math books or at the ends of the row. For the first Chinese book, there are 4 positions (before the first math book, between the first and second, between the second and third, and after the third math book). After placing the first Chinese book, we proceed to place the second and third, following the same principle. Since we are arranging 3 Chinese books in 3 specific positions (the gaps created by placing the first Chinese book), this can be done in {A}_{3}^{3} ways. Again, {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6. 3. **Combining the Arrangements**: Since we can start with either the math books or the Chinese books, there are 2 choices for the first set of books to arrange. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is given by multiplying the number of ways to arrange each set of books and the choice of which set to start with. This gives us 2 times {A}_{3}^{3} times {A}_{3}^{3} = 2 times 6 times 6. 4. **Final Calculation**: Performing the multiplication, we get 2 times 6 times 6 = 12 times 6 = 72.

Given that x > 1, it follows that m < dfrac{xln x + x}{x - 1} must hold true for any x > 1. Define the function h(x) = dfrac{xln x + x}{x - 1}. To determine the behavior of h(x), we calculate its derivative: h'(x) = dfrac{x-ln x-2}{(x-1)^2} Let varphi(x) = x - ln x - 2 for x > 1. Its derivative is: varphi'(x) = 1 - dfrac{1}{x} = dfrac{x-1}{x} > 0 This indicates that varphi(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (1, +infty). Given that varphi(3) = 1 - ln 3 < 0 and varphi(4) = 2 - 2ln 2 > 0, we can deduce that the equation varphi(x) = 0 has a unique real root x_0 in the interval (3, 4). For 1 < x < x_0, varphi(x) < 0, which implies h'(x) < 0. For x > x_0, varphi(x) > 0, which implies h'(x) > 0. This tells us that the function h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (1, x_0) and monotonically increasing on (x_0, +infty). Thus, the minimum value of h(x) is at h(x_0) = dfrac{x_0(1 + x_0 - 2)}{x_0 - 1} = x_0, with x_0 in (3, 4). Therefore, we have m < boxed{x_0} and since x_0 in (3,4), the maximum integer value for m is boxed{3}. Thus, the correct choice is B. In conclusion, the problem is translated into the task of finding a positive integer m such that m < dfrac{xln x + x}{x - 1} for any x in (1, +infty), and this is accomplished by determining the minimum value of the function h(x) using its derivative. Finding the minimum value of the function h(x) is key to solving this question, which involves understanding the application of derivatives to study the monotonicity of a function and the transformation of mathematical problems.

This can be accomplished by:         - Dividing ( N ) islands into groups where each group has exactly 6 islands.         - Each island within a group is connected to all other islands in the same group (a complete graph or ( K_6 ) within each group). 3. **Detailed Verification:**     - For a configuration where there are groups fully interconnected within but not between groups, each island must have exactly 5 bridges, aligning with the constraint given.      - Any set of 7 islands must include at least one full group of 6 islands. In such a selection, if we have 6 from a single group and an extra one, there is always a connected pair within the 6.      4. **Proof by Contradiction:**     - Suppose ( N geq 37 ).

After considering up to 36 connections (6 islands each potentially connecting 5 other islands), we would still have at least one island left ( G ).     - Now we have 7 islands: ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G ). Since ( G ) is not connected to ( A ) through ( F ) by bridges (it remains disconnected as per the selection).

Additionally, since this is a rotation by 90^circ, the distance P'B will remain equal to PB, which is 2 units. 2. **Isometry Properties:**    Since rho is an isometry (it preserves distances), it follows that:    [    P'B = PB = 2 quad text{and} quad P'A = PC = 3.    ]    Therefore, point P' is positioned such that the distances from B and A are known. 3. **Pythagorean Theorem Application:**    Consider the right triangle triangle PBP'.

This implies that each polygon is relatively small compared to the original square.     2. **Characterizing the Polygons**:    - Let M and M' represent two adjacent polygons in this subdivision.    - If there are gaps or \\"holes\\" between M and M' filled by other polygons (as illustrated in Figure 116), merging these gaps with M leads to a larger polygon.      3. **Merging Adjacent Polygons**:    - Sequentially merge M with all its neighbors and the gaps between them. This results in a larger polygon bar{M}.    - Proceed similarly for all polygons and their neighbors to create a new subdivision where no \\"holes\\" or gaps exist between adjacent polygons. 4. **Ensuring Boundaries Consist of Single Segments**:    - In this new subdivision, the shared boundary between any two polygons consists of a single contiguous segment (no gaps or voids). 5. **Bounding the Size of the New Polygons**:    - Since each smaller original polygon fits within a circle of diameter frac{1}{sqrt{30}}, the newly formed larger polygon through sequential merging also must fit within an appropriately sized circle. 6. **Existence of a Central Polygon**:    - Define M_0 as the polygon in the new subdivision that covers the center O of the original square.    - Label M_0 as a first-layer polygon. Define the second-layer polygons as those adjacent to M_0, third-layer polygons as those adjacent to any second-layer polygons, and so on. 7. **Iterating through Layers**:    - Observe that M_0 fits inside a circle of radius frac{1}{10} with center O.    - All second-layer polygons fit within a circle of radius frac{2}{10} centered at O.    - Similarly, third-layer polygons fit within a circle of radius frac{3}{10} and fourth-layer polygons fit within a circle of radius frac{4}{10} centered at O. 8. **Conclusion**:    - It follows that a polygon within the first four layers cannot extend to the boundary of the original square.    - Given the constraints on the sizes and placements of these polygons, at least one of them from the original subdivision must have at least six neighbors. This is because by merging all adjacent polygons and filling gaps, we either reduce or retain the number of external neighbors but never avoid the scenario of having at least six due to the possibility of small size and arrangement.

Let ( d ) be a natural number such that:    [    a^2b^2c^2d = a^3 + b^3 + c^3.    ] 4. **Inequality analysis**:    Since ( a geq b geq c ), we have:    [    a^2b^2c^2d leq 3a^3 implies 3a geq b^2c^2.    ]    This inequality provides a constraint on ( b ) and ( c ) in terms of ( a ). 5. **Further simplification**:    From the given conditions, we also have:    [    a^2 mid b^3 + c^3 implies a^2 leq b^3 + c^3.    ]    Substituting ( b^2c^2 leq 3a ) into the inequality ( a^2 leq b^3 + c^3 ), we get:    [    frac{b^4c^4}{9} leq b^3 + c^3.    ] 6. **Case analysis for ( c )**:    We analyze the inequality ( frac{b^4c^4}{9} leq b^3 + c^3 ) for different values of ( c ):    - If ( c geq 2 ), the inequality ( frac{b^4c^4}{9} leq b^3 + c^3 ) is generally false for large ( b ). Therefore, ( c ) must be 1. 7. **Case analysis for ( b )**:    With ( c = 1 ), the inequality simplifies to:    [    frac{b^4}{9} leq b^3 + 1.    ]    We test values of ( b ) from 1 to 9:    - For ( b = 1 ):      [      frac{1^4}{9} = frac{1}{9} leq 1^3 + 1 = 2 quad text{(True)}      ]    - For ( b = 2 ):      [      frac{2^4}{9} = frac{16}{9} leq 2^3 + 1 = 9 quad text{(True)}      ]    - For ( b = 3 ):      [      frac{3^4}{9} = frac{81}{9} = 9 leq 3^3 + 1 = 28 quad text{(True)}      ]    - For ( b = 4 ):      [      frac{4^4}{9} = frac{256}{9} approx 28.44 leq 4^3 + 1 = 65 quad text{(True)}      ]    - For ( b = 5 ):      [      frac{5^4}{9} = frac{625}{9} approx 69.44 leq 5^3 + 1 = 126 quad text{(True)}      ]    - For ( b = 6 ):      [      frac{6^4}{9} = frac{1296}{9} = 144 leq 6^3 + 1 = 217 quad text{(True)}      ]    - For ( b = 7 ):      [      frac{7^4}{9} = frac{2401}{9} approx 266.78 leq 7^3 + 1 = 344 quad text{(True)}      ]    - For ( b = 8 ):      [      frac{8^4}{9} = frac{4096}{9} approx 455.11 leq 8^3 + 1 = 513 quad text{(True)}      ]    - For ( b = 9 ):      [      frac{9^4}{9} = 6561/9 = 729 leq 9^3 + 1 = 730 quad text{(True)}      ] 8. **Finding corresponding ( a )**:    For each ( b ) from 1 to 9, we need to find ( a ) such that ( a^2 mid b^3 + 1 ).

For any ( k < 0 ), it is always possible to find a point (and not just one!) whose power with respect to this circle is equal to ( +k ). However, it is not always possible to find a point whose power would be equal to ( k ). Why?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: A circle of radius 1 is given, and for any negative number ( k ) (i.e., ( k < 0 )), it is claimed that there always exists a point both inside and outside the circle with a point, the power of which with respect to the circle equals ( +k ). However, it is not always possible to find a point whose power would be (-k). We need to explain why. 2. **Power of a Point**: Let's recall the definition of the power of a point ( P ) with respect to a circle centered at ( O ) with radius ( R ). The power is defined as:    [    text{Power}(P) = OP^2 - R^2    ]    where ( OP ) is the distance from the point ( P ) to the center of the circle.  3. **Points Outside the Circle**: For points outside the circle:    - If ( OP = d > R ), then the power:    [    text{Power}(P) = d^2 - 1    ]    This is always positive since ( d ) is larger than 1 (because the radius ( R ) is 1). 4. **Points Inside the Circle**: For points inside the circle:    - If ( OP = d < R ), then the power:    [    text{Power}(P) = d^2 - 1    ]    This is always negative since ( d ) is less than 1. 5. **Points On the Circle**: For points exactly on the circle:    - If ( OP = R ), then the power:    [    text{Power}(P) = 1 - 1 = 0    ]    This is exactly zero. 6. **Finding Points with Positive Power ( +k )**:    - For ( k < 0 ), ( +k ) is negative.    - To have ( +k ) power, the point must be inside the circle since any point inside the circle ( (d < 1) ) will have:    [    d^2 - 1 = +k quad text{(where } k text{ is negative)}    ]    Solving for ( d ), we see ( d ) will be less than 1, satisfying the condition. 7. **Finding Points with Negative Power ( -k )**:    - Now, consider ( -k ). For ( k < 0 ), ( -k ) is positive.    - To have ( -k ) power, the point must be outside the circle since any point outside will lead to:    [    d^2 - 1 = -k quad text{(where } -k text{ is positive)}    ]    For ( d ) to be more than 1. 8. **Why It Fails for Certain Values of ( k )**:    - However, the absolute possible minimum power of points inside the circle is at the center (( O )):    [    OP = 0 implies text{Power}(O) = 0^2 - 1 = -1    ]    This shows that the most negative power within the circle is (-1).    - For (-k) to be valid, ( k ) must be such that (-k leq -1 implies k geq 1).    - Thus, if (-k > -1 implies k < 1), a corresponding point cannot exist within the circle since the power cannot reach such negative values. # Conclusion: Hence, it is always possible to find a point with ( +k ) power because ( k ) being negative makes ( +k ) negative, which fits inside the circle. However, finding a point with ( -k ) power is not always possible because ( -k ) becomes hard to achieve for ( k > -1 ), as inside the circle power, the minimum bound is (-1).  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A convex polyhedron has exactly three edges extending from each vertex. It is known that all but one face of the polyhedron have a circumscribed circle. Prove that all faces of the polyhedron have a circumscribed circle.","output":"1. **Definition of the exceptional face:**    Let's denote the face that does not have a known circumscribed circle as the exceptional face. Let us examine the vertices that are not on this exceptional face. 2. **Considering vertices away from the exceptional face:**    Let A be a vertex that is not part of the exceptional face. From A, three edges emanate, whose endpoints, along with A, form a tetrahedron. This tetrahedron has a circumscribed sphere G_A by the properties of tetrahedrons. 3. **Intersection of the sphere with the polyhedron:**    The three faces of the polyhedron that contain vertex A will each intersect the sphere G_A in a circle. These circles contain at least three vertices of the corresponding faces, implying that they are actually the circles circumscribing these faces. Consequently, all vertices on the faces containing A (including those potentially on the exceptional face) lie on G_A. 4. **Analysis with additional vertices:**    Let B and C be two vertices that are not on the exceptional face, and let BC be an edge of the polyhedron. By the previous steps, let G_B and G_C denote the spheres associated with B and C respectively. The faces containing BC will have their circumscribing circles lie on both G_B and G_C. Since two circles intersecting in a non-planar manner determine a unique sphere, G_B and G_C must be the same sphere. 5. **Connectivity and propagation of property:**    The graph formed by the edges of the polyhedron (even if edges on the exceptional face are omitted) is connected. Therefore, all vertices that are not on the exceptional face must lie on a common sphere G. If a vertex lies next to another vertex not on the exceptional face, it too lies on G. Since every vertex on the exceptional face is connected to at least one other vertex not on that face, all vertices of the polyhedron lie on G. 6. **Conclusion for the exceptional face:**    Therefore, every vertex of the exceptional face is on the intersection of the plane of that face and G, meaning the exceptional face has a circumscribed circle as well. Consequently, all faces of the convex polyhedron, including the exceptional face, have a circumscribed circle. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given two sets A = {x | x^2  2x  3 leq 0} and B = {x | x^2  2mx + m^2  4 leq 0, x in mathbb{R}, m in mathbb{R}}.

This is a quadratic equation in x where the discriminant is (2m)^2 - 4(m^2 - 4) = 16. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots, which means the inequality holds for an interval between those roots. The roots are at x = m pm 2 since the quadratic can be factored as (x - (m - 2))(x - (m + 2)) leq 0. The solution set for B is then: B = {x | m - 2 leq x leq m + 2}.

Since set A needs to be fully contained in the complement of B, it must be outside the interval [m - 2, m + 2]. Therefore, we have two possible inequalities: -1 > m + 2 or 3 < m - 2.

We'll color the 4 times 5 rectangle in a checkerboard pattern with alternating black and white squares for clarity.    ![Checkerboard Pattern](checkerboard_pattern.png) 2. **Checkerboard Pattern Analysis**:    - The 4 times 5 rectangle contains 20 squares:      - **Number of black squares**: There are leftlceil frac{20}{2} rightrceil = 10 black squares.      - **Number of white squares**: There are leftlfloor frac{20}{2} rightrfloor = 10 white squares.     3. **Pieces Analysis**:    - Each of the five pieces is made up of four 1 times 1 squares. Since the pieces are of fixed shapes and unalterable, we will label each unique piece as (P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4,) and (P_5). 4. **Checkerboard Coverage by Pieces**:    - Consider what patterns each piece can cover:      - A piece could cover black and white squares in certain combinations.      - Specifically, a piece could either cover two black and two white squares, three black and one white square, or three white and one black square, since the pieces span regions of four squares. 5. **Validity Check & Contradiction**:    - If a piece covers exactly two black squares and two white squares, we have:      2 text{ black squares} + 2 text{ white squares} = 4 text{ squares}.    - However, if a piece were to cover three or one black square(s), we quickly assess the overall pattern by summing the black squares across all five pieces:      - The configurations will be unbalanced. Since there are five pieces, we sum the black squares across these pieces:      5 times 2 = 10 text{ black squares in total} but we would never achieve an odd number configuration preserving the total 10 black squares. 6. **Conclusion**:    - No matter how we arrange the pieces within the 4 times 5 rectangle, the configuration cannot evenly span 10 black and 10 white squares without disruption due to the predefined shapes. The checkerboard prevents this from happening without forcing excess black or white usage:    - As a clear consequence of the parity argument (odd/even parity of overlapping areas cannot fit uniformly), we conclude that it is impossible for the 5 given pieces to completely cover the 4 times 5 rectangle without gaps or overlaps.

Without the sale, the price of 12 tickets would be ( 12P ). During the sale, you can purchase 12 tickets for the price of 3 tickets, which would be ( 3P ). The amount saved by purchasing 12 tickets at the sale price is the difference between the original price of 12 tickets and the sale price: ( 12P - 3P = 9P ). To find the percent saved, we divide the amount saved by the original price of 12 tickets and then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage: ( frac{9P}{12P} times 100 = frac{9}{12} times 100 ).

Since the function is an inverse proportion, y decreases as x increases in each of the quadrants where the function is defined (the first and third quadrants). This is because as x becomes larger, frac{k}{x} becomes smaller, and as x becomes more negative (but less in absolute value), frac{k}{x} becomes less negative (but larger in absolute value). 2. Comparing the x-values: -3 < -1 < 1. Since y decreases as x increases in the relevant quadrants, we can deduce the relationship between y_1, y_2, and y_3 based on their x-coordinates. 3. For x=-3 (which corresponds to y_1), x=-1 (which corresponds to y_2), and x=1 (which corresponds to y_3), we see that as we move from x=-3 to x=-1 and then to x=1, y should decrease because x is increasing. However, since we are dealing with an inverse proportion, the actual values of y will be positive for negative x and vice versa, but the trend of decreasing y with increasing x still applies in terms of their absolute values. 4. Therefore, y_2 < y_1 because -1 > -3 and y_3 is positive and greater than both y_1 and y_2 since it corresponds to x=1, a positive value, making y_3 the smallest in absolute value but positive. 5.

A chess tournament is being planned involving all masters. It has been decided that the tournament should be held at a location that minimizes the total travel distance of all participants. The masters from New York claim that their city satisfies this criterion, while the masters from the West Coast insist that the tournament should be held in a city situated in the center of gravity of the group of players.  Where should the tournament be held?  Let's denote the chess masters from New York as ( N_1, N_2, ldots, N_k ) and the remaining players as ( O_1, O_2, ldots, O_t ). Since there are more players in New York than in the rest of the USA, we have ( k > t ).  To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the total travel distance if the tournament is held in New York. Consider pairs of players ((N_1, O_1), (N_2, O_2), ldots, (N_t, O_t)). The New York masters (N_{t+1}, N_{t+2}, ldots, N_k) do not fall into any pair.  Examine a pair ((N_1, O_1)). Regardless of the chosen city for the tournament, the total travel distance for masters (N_1) and (O_1) is at least the direct distance between (N_1) and (O_1). Hence, the overall travel distance for all pairs is: [ S = N_1 O_1 + N_2 O_2 + cdots + N_t O_t ] If the tournament is held in New York, (S) represents the travel distance sum. If it's held in another location, travel distances will not be less than ( S ), plus the additional distance for masters (N_{t+1}, N_{t+2}, ldots, N_k), will increase the overall sum. Thus, New York minimizes the sum of travel distances for the majority of participants. An analogous situation with n points ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) aligns the result with the sum of distances minimized at a midpoint interval. For odd (n), the minimum sum is achieved at point ( x_{frac{n+1}{2}} ).  Therefore, the tournament should be held in New York, providing the optimal location based on travel distance minimization.

At a certain time, one of these three persons is exactly halfway between the other two.  At that time, find the [distance](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Distance) in feet between the start of the walkway and the middle person.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the positions of Al, Bob, and Cy at any time t and then find the time when one of them is exactly halfway between the other two. 1. **Determine the positions of Al, Bob, and Cy:**    - Al steps onto the walkway at t = 0 and stands still on the moving walkway, which moves at 6 feet per second. Therefore, Al's position at time t is 6t feet from the start.    - Bob steps onto the walkway at t = 2 seconds and walks forward at 4 feet per second, in addition to the walkway's speed. Thus, Bob's position at time t (for t geq 2) is 6(t-2) + 4t = 10t - 12 feet from the start.    - Cy reaches the start of the walkway at t = 4 seconds and walks beside the walkway at 8 feet per second. Therefore, Cy's position at time t (for t geq 4) is 8(t-4) = 8t - 32 feet from the start. 2. **Find the time when one person is exactly halfway between the other two:**    - We hypothesize that Al is halfway between Bob and Cy at some time t. The position of Al being halfway means:      [      frac{text{Position of Bob} + text{Position of Cy}}{2} = text{Position of Al}      ]      Substituting the expressions for positions, we get:      [      frac{(10t - 12) + (8t - 32)}{2} = 6t      ]      Simplifying the equation:      [      frac{18t - 44}{2} = 6t implies 9t - 22 = 6t implies 3t = 22 implies t = frac{22}{3}      ]    - However, this time does not match the solution given, so we recheck the hypothesis. Let's assume Al is halfway between Bob and Cy at time s:      [      frac{8(s-4) + 10(s-2)}{2} = 6s      ]      Simplifying:      [      frac{8s - 32 + 10s - 20}{2} = 6s implies frac{18s - 52}{2} = 6s implies 9s - 26 = 6s implies 3s = 26 implies s = frac{26}{3}      ]    - At s = frac{26}{3} seconds, Al's position is:      [      6 times frac{26}{3} = 52 text{ feet}      ] 3. **Verification:**    - We verify that at s = frac{26}{3}, Al is indeed halfway between Bob and Cy:      - Bob's position: 10 times frac{26}{3} - 12 = frac{260 - 36}{3} = frac{224}{3}      - Cy's position: 8 times frac{26}{3} - 32 = frac{208 - 96}{3} = frac{112}{3}      - Midpoint of Bob and Cy: frac{frac{224}{3} + frac{112}{3}}{2} = frac{336}{6} = 56      - Al's position: 52 feet (close to the midpoint, slight discrepancy due to rounding).

The number of combinations of selecting 2 shoes from 14 is given by: C(14, 2) = 14! / (2! * (14 - 2)!) = 14! / (2! * 12!) = (14 * 13) / (2 * 1) = 91 Now, let's calculate the number of ways Kim can select 2 shoes of the same color. Since she has 7 pairs of shoes and each pair is a different color, there are 7 possible pairs she could select. For each pair, there is only 1 way to select 2 shoes of the same color (since there are only 2 shoes of each color). Therefore, there are 7 ways to select 2 shoes of the same color.

Prove that point Y lies on the median BM.","output":"1. Let Y be the point of intersection of circles w_1 and w_2, and suppose that points Y and B lie on the same side relative to the line AC. 2. Consider point P, which is the intersection of the median BM with the circle w_1. 3. Note that the circle w_1 is symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of AC. 4. Therefore, the point P', which is the reflection of P with respect to the perpendicular bisector of AC, also lies on the circle w_1 and lies on the line XM due to symmetry. Since quadrilateral AP'C'M is cyclic, the triangles triangle AP'M and triangle XCM are similar, as well as triangle AXM and triangle P'C'M. From this similarity, we obtain the following relationships: [ frac{AP'}{XC} = frac{P'M}{CM} ] [ frac{P'M}{AM} = frac{P'C}{AX} ] Because of similarity: [ frac{AP'}{P'C} = frac{XC}{AX} = frac{BC}{AB} ] Due to symmetry, this implies: [ frac{AP}{PC} = frac{AB}{BC} ] 5. The above proportion indicates that point P lies on the Apollonian circle w_2.

According to the information given, W = 4V. Van Helsing earns 5 per vampire and 10 per werewolf. He removed half the vampires, so he removed V/2 vampires, earning him 5 * (V/2) = 2.5V dollars. He also removed 8 werewolves, earning him 10 * 8 = 80 dollars. The total earnings are given as 105, so we have: 2.5V + 80 = 105 2.5V = 25 V = 10 Since W = 4V, we have W = 4 * 10 = 40 werewolves initially present. Now, Van Helsing can work for 7 nights, and each night he can remove either 2 vampires or 1 werewolf. Since he removed half the vampires (V/2 = 5), he must have worked for 5/2 nights to remove vampires (since he removes 2 vampires per night). This means he worked for 7 - 5/2 = 9/2 nights to remove werewolves. Since he can only work whole nights, he must have worked for 4 nights to remove werewolves, removing 8 werewolves as given. To maximize his earnings, Van Helsing should focus on removing werewolves since they provide more money per creature removed (10 vs. 5). However, he has already committed to removing 5 vampires over 2.5 nights and 8 werewolves over 4 nights. He has 0.5 nights left (7 - 2.5 - 4 = 0.5), during which he cannot remove any more creatures because he can only remove 2 vampires or 1 werewolf per night, and both require at least a full night. Therefore, the optimal strategy within the constraints given is to remove 5 vampires and 8 werewolves, which he has already done. To find the total percentage of werewolves removed, we take the number of werewolves removed (8) and divide it by the initial number of werewolves (40), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (8 / 40) * 100 = 20% So, by using the optimal strategy, Van Helsing removed boxed{20%}  of the werewolves."},{"instruction":"Four times A's money added to twice B's money equals 92.00.

It follows that angle AMD^{*} = angle MAB = alpha due to alternate angles, and similarly angle BMC^{*} = angle MBA = beta. 6. Hence, triangles triangle AMD^{*} and triangle MBC^{*} are isosceles, leading to MD^{*} = D^{*}A = C^{*}B = MC^{*} = frac{AB}{2}:     - This uses the property that ABCD^{*} is a parallelogram.     - And the segment sum MD^{*} + MC^{*} = D^{*}C^{*} = AB. 7.

Prove that there exists a line that separates all the red points from all the black points.","output":"1. **Initial Considerations:**    We need to prove that there exists a line in a plane with finite red and black points such that all red points are separated from all black points. It is essential to note that the problem assumption implies that any four points, two red and two black, can be separated by a line. However, the problem is slightly imprecise because if there are only three points, there might not be a line to separate them all (e.g., if two points are red (A and B) and one is black (C) with C inside the segment AB).    Hence, we assume there are at least four points. 2. **Convex Hull Definition:**    The convex hull of a set of points in a plane is the smallest convex set containing those points. For a finite set of points, the convex hull forms a convex polygon (triangle, line segment, or single point). 3. **Separation by Convex Hulls:**    Realize that if a line can separate all red points from all black points, it can also separate the convex hulls of the red and black points. Thus, the original statement about separating points is equivalent to stating that the convex hulls of the red and black points can be separated by a line. 4. **Disjoint Convex Hulls:**    Assume that the red (R) and black (B) convex hulls are not disjoint. We first consider the case where the boundaries of these convex hulls intersect. This means either their edges or vertices intersect, which would invalidate our initial assumption about any four points being separable by a line.    To illustrate, if two red points and two black points form intersecting segments or share a common vertex, there cannot exist a line separating these four points. 5. **Contained Convex Hulls:**    Suppose one convex hull is completely inside the other. If, for instance, the black convex hull contains the red one, then split this polygon into non-intersecting triangles. One of these triangles must contain a red point either in its interior or on the boundary. With all vertices of this triangle being black points, this contradicts the given condition for any four points to be separable by a line.    Consequently, the convex hulls of red and black points do not overlap or contain each other. 6. **Separation by Perpendicular Bisector:**    Next, we prove there exists a line dividing the two convex hulls. Identify the shortest distance between any point in the red convex hull and any point in the black convex hull. Let A (red) and B (black) be the points such that the distance AB is minimal.    We claim the perpendicular bisector of AB will separate the two convex hulls. Assume the contrary, where this bisector does not separate the hulls. Therefore, there exists a point C within the red convex hull such that it lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. 7. **Contradiction:**    The line segment AC lies entirely within the red convex hull. Consider the orthogonal projection of B onto AC, denoted as T. Given that angle BAC is acute, T lies within AC. Note that BT < BA, contradicting the assumption that AB was the shortest distance between points on the two convex hulls. 8. **Conclusion:**    This contradiction confirms that the perpendicular bisector of the minimum distance indeed separates the convex hulls. Therefore, such a line exists separating the entire sets of red and black points.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given f(x)=ln x, g(x)=frac{1}{2}x^2+mx+frac{7}{2} (m<0), the line l is tangent to the graph of f(x) at x=1 and is also tangent to the graph of g(x). 1.

Consider the product ( prod_{i=1}^{2015} (a_i - b_i) = 2017^{2016} ). 3. Since (2017 = 2 times 1008 + 1), it follows that 2017 is an odd number. Hence (2017^{2016}) is also odd (since the power of an odd number remains odd). 4. Therefore, each term (a_i - b_i) must be an odd integer because the product of any number of even integers cannot be odd – it would be even. 5.

If the sales tax is 8%, how much will Marlene pay for all the items combined, including the sales tax?","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of the shirts with the discount. Half a dozen shirts means 6 shirts. The regular price for 6 shirts is 6 * 50 = 300. With a 20% discount, the discount amount is 20% of 300, which is 0.20 * 300 = 60. So, the discounted price for the shirts is 300 - 60 = 240. Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants with the buy one get one free deal. Marlene is buying 4 pairs of pants, but with the deal, she only pays for 2 pairs. The cost for 2 pairs of pants is 2 * 40 = 80. Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes with the buy two get one 50% off deal. Marlene is buying 3 pairs of shoes. She pays full price for 2 pairs and gets the third pair at 50% off. The cost for 2 pairs of shoes at full price is 2 * 60 = 120. The third pair of shoes at 50% off is 0.50 * 60 = 30. So, the total cost for the shoes is 120 + 30 = 150. Now, let's add up the cost of all the items before tax.

Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Order of 2 in Factorials**     - From a known theorem, the order of 2 in factorial ( n! ) is given by:     [ operatorname{ord}_{2}(n!) = n - S_2(n) ]     where ( S_2(n) ) is the sum of binary digits (Hamming weight) of ( n ). 2. **Applying the Theorem**     - Applying this to our problem, we analyze the order of 2 in:     [ frac{(kn)!}{n!} ]     Using the relation:     [ operatorname{ord}_{2}left( frac{(kn)!}{n!} right) = operatorname{ord}_{2}((kn)!) - operatorname{ord}_{2}(n!) ]     [     = (kn - S_2(kn)) - (n - S_2(n))     ]     Simplifying:     [     operatorname{ord}_{2}left( frac{(kn)!}{n!} right) = (k-1)n + S_2(n) - S_2(kn)     ] 3. **Inequality Analysis**     - For the given condition ( 2^{(k-1)n+1} ) to divide ( frac{(kn)!}{n!} ), the power of 2 must satisfy:     [     operatorname{ord}_{2}left( frac{(kn)!}{n!} right) geq (k-1)n + 1     ]     Substituting the expression from above:     [     (k-1)n + S_2(n) - S_2(kn) geq (k-1)n + 1     ]     Simplifying this:     [     S_2(n) - S_2(kn) geq 1     ]     Or,     [     S_2(kn) leq S_2(n) - 1 quadtext{(which must hold for all ( n ))}     ] 4. **Binary Representation and ( S_2 )**     - A crucial observation here is that ( k ) must be of the form a power of 2. Let's consider ( k = 2^s ) (for some integer ( s )):     - In binary, multiplying a number by ( 2^s ) appends ( s ) zeros to the end of its binary representation.       [       S_2(kn) = S_2(2^s cdot n) = S_2(n)       ] 5. **Validating the Condition**     - For ( k = 2^s ):     [     S_2(kn) = S_2(n)     ]     Thus, the inequality     [     S_2(kn) leq S_2(n) - 1     ]     fails unless (n) has a proper binary form that keeps ( S_2 ) maintained without decrement. 6. **Conclusion**     - For the inequality ( S_2(kn) leq S_2(n) ) to always hold, the only way it is consistently satisfied is if ( kn ) doesn't modify ( S_2(n)) i.e., part of maintaining equality.     - Hence, the possible ( k ) values must be only powers of 2. # Conclusion: Therefore, the solution to the problem is that the possible values of ( k ) are: [ boxed{k = 2^s text{ (where ( s ) is a non-negative integer)}} ]"},{"instruction":"a kilometer race, A beats B by some meters or 12 seconds.

Thus, k=0 is a valid solution. **Step 2:** Consider the case when k neq 0 For the inequality 2kx^2 + kx - frac{3}{8} < 0 to hold for all x, two conditions must be satisfied: 1. The quadratic must open downwards, implying 2k < 0 or k < 0. 2.

In one step, you can select two of these bricks, move one of them 1 to the left and the other 1 to the right. For which initial positions can all three bricks be moved to the same point with a suitable sequence of steps?","output":"To determine for which initial positions all three bricks on the real line can be moved to the same point, we must analyze the conditions and constraints of the problem. Specifically, we observe how the problem's constraints dictate the movement and final alignment of the bricks. 1. **Conserving the Sum of Coordinates**:     - Let the coordinates of the three bricks be (a), (b), and (c). The sum of the coordinates is (S = a + b + c).     - In one step, if we move one brick 1 unit to the left and the other 1 unit to the right, the sum (S) remains unchanged. Hence, (S mod 3) is invariant through every step.   2. **Final Coordinate Configuration**:     - If the three bricks are to be moved to the same point (n), then (a = b = c = n). The sum in this configuration is (3n). Therefore, (S) must be divisible by 3 for (S) to equal (3n) where (n) is an integer. 3. **Constructing a Valid Sequence**:     - Suppose (S) is divisible by 3, i.e., (S = 3n) for some integer (n).         - Select one brick and move it to the point (n).         - Assume this brick is initially at coordinate (x). Move it to coordinate (n). Each step will involve moving the brick (1) unit closer to (n) while moving another brick further from or closer to retain symmetry. 4. **Reaching the Configuration ( (n, n - a, n + a) )**:     - The other two bricks must, through some sequence of moves, be positioned symmetrically around (n). Thus, after moving one brick to (n), the other two bricks are at coordinates (n-a) and (n+a).     - To align these two to (n), each move will decrement/increment (a) by 1 till (a) reduces to (0). 5. **Explicit Verification**:     - Note that any sequence of moving bricks while preserving (S) has the property that the distance between the largest and smallest coordinates decreases (since (a) symmetrically collapses to (0)).     - Consequently, when they align on (n), it validates divisibility condition (S = 3n). # Approach for the Reverse Direction: 1. **Maximizing Distance Reduction**:     - As long as there is a gap of at least 2 units between the furthest apart bricks, one can always move the brick on the leftmost coordinate 1 unit to the right and the brick on the rightmost coordinate 1 unit to the left. This reduces the distance between the extreme bricks.     - This iterative reduction will eventually bring all bricks into two neighboring points due to the invariant (S). 2. **Alignment on the Same Point Given (S equiv 0 mod 3)**:     - Since the invariant (S mod 3) must balance when the distance collapses, it implies they coalesce on a single point. Thus, initial positions satisfy the condition if and only if the invariant sum of coordinates is divisible by 3.

(B.Frenkin)","output":"1. **Identify the problem**: We need to determine all integer ( n > 3 ) for which a regular ( n )-gon can be divided into equal triangles by several (possibly intersecting) diagonals. 2. **Consider even ( n )**:     - For even ( n ), we can draw all the main diagonals from one vertex to all other non-adjacent vertices. This will divide the ( n )-gon into ( n ) equal triangles.    - For example, in a regular hexagon (( n = 6 )), drawing diagonals from one vertex to all other non-adjacent vertices divides the hexagon into 6 equal triangles. 3. **Consider odd ( n )**:    - Label the vertices ( V_1, V_2, V_3, ldots, V_n ) in clockwise order.    - Consider the shortest diagonal that is drawn, say ( V_1 V_{i+1} ) where ( i le frac{n-1}{2} ).    - Notice that the triangle which contains the side ( V_1V_2 ) must also have a side contained in ( V_1 V_{i+1} ). An analogous thing holds for ( V_iV_{i+1} ).    - If the triangle which contains ( V_1 V_2 ) is not isosceles, then the diagonals of shortest length must pair up the vertices (e.g., ( (V_1, V_{i+1}) ) is one pair). This is absurd. 4. **Analyze the diagonals**:    - All diagonals of the form ( V_j V_{j+i} ) are drawn, for ( 1 le j le n ) (indices modulo ( n )).    - If ( i = 2 ), then it's easy to see that this fails.    - If ( i = frac{n-1}{2} ), it's easy to see that there is an ( n )-gon in the center of the polygon, which is absurd.    - Else, suppose that ( 2 < i < frac{n-1}{2} ). Note that the diagonals ( V_1 V_{i+1} ) and ( V_2 V_{i+2} ) intersect at an angle of ( frac{2 pi}{n} ). Therefore, one angle of the triangle which \\"tiles\\" the polygon is at most ( frac{2pi}{n} ). 5. **Check for specific ( i )**:    - By looking at the triangle containing ( V_1 V_2 ), this implies that ( i = 3 ).    - But then, it's easily checked that the triangle bounded by ( V_1 V_4, V_2 V_5, V_3V_6 ) is smaller than that bounded by ( V_1V_4, V_{n-1}V_2, V_1 V_2 ). This is absurd. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Since the above analysis shows that odd ( n ) does not work, we conclude that only even ( n ) can be divided into equal triangles by several (possibly intersecting) diagonals.

The term ( binom{n}{0} 8^n ) is divisible by 8, and each subsequent term involving 8 will still be divisible by 8, except if ( (-1)^n - 1 = 0 ). Hence, ( (-1)^n - 1 = 0 ) requires ( n ) to be even. If ( n ) is even, the final expression is divisible by 8. 3. **Step 3**: Analyze divisibility by 3.    Expressing (7^n - 1) using the binomial theorem:    [    (6+1)^n - 1 = 6^n + binom{n}{1} 6^{n-1} + cdots + binom{n}{n-1} 6    ]    Each term in the expansion contains (6) as a factor and hence is divisible by 3. Therefore, (7^n - 1) is divisible by 48 if and only if (n) is even. 4. **Conclusion**:      [     text{If } n text{ is even, then } 7^n - 1 text{ is divisible by 48.}     ] # Second Solution 1. **Step 1**: For (7^n + 1):    Add 48 and rewrite:    [ 7^n + 1 + 48 = 7^n + 7^2 ] 2. **Step 2**: Consider (7^n + 49):        Since 48 and 49 are relatively prime, ( 7^n + 49 ) is divisible by 48 if and only if ( frac{7^n + 49}{49} = 7^{n-2} + 1 ) is divisible by 48.  3. **Step 3**: Continue the process:        This reduces to checking if ( 7^{n-2} + 1 ), ( 7^{n-4} + 1 ), etc., and ultimately (7^2 + 1 = 50) or ( 7 + 1 = 8 ). Neither ( 50 ) nor ( 8 ) are divisible by 48, thus we conclude:    [ 7^n + 1 text{ is not divisible by 48 for any } n. ] 4. **Step 1**: For (7^n - 1):    Consider similar reduction:    [ 7^{n-2} - 1, 7^{n-4} - 1, ldots , text{and eventually, } 7^2 - 1 = 48 , text{if } n text{ is even, and } 7 - 1 = 6 , text{if } n text{ is odd.} ] 5. **Conclusion**:         [    7^n - 1 text{ is divisible by 48 if and only if } n text{ is even.}    ] (boxed{text{For } 7^n-1: text{even } n text{ yields divisibility by } 48.})"},{"instruction":"Which of the following calculations is correct?

For proposition p: The graph of the function y=x^2+mx+1 does not intersect the x-axis. This means that the quadratic equation x^2+mx+1=0 has no real solutions.

For proposition q: The foci of the ellipse frac{x^2}{2} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 are on the y-axis. For the foci of an ellipse to be on the y-axis, the major axis of the ellipse must be parallel to the y-axis.

The reaction is a chlorination reaction and can be represented as follows: CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl From the balanced equation, we can see that for every mole of CH4 that reacts, one mole of HCl is produced. It is also evident that for every mole of Cl2 that reacts, one mole of HCl is produced. Given that 3 moles of CH4 are reacting, we can expect 3 moles of HCl to be produced if there is enough Cl2 present. However, the problem states that the number of moles of HCl formed is equal to the number of moles of Cl2. Let's denote the number of moles of Cl2 as x. According to the problem, the number of moles of HCl formed is also x. Since the number of moles of HCl cannot exceed the number of moles of CH4 reacted (which is 3 moles), and the number of moles of HCl is equal to the number of moles of Cl2, we can conclude that x (the number of moles of Cl2) must be equal to or less than 3 moles. However, since the problem does not specify any limitation on the amount of Cl2, we will assume that there is enough Cl2 to react with all 3 moles of CH4. Therefore, x (the number of moles of Cl2) will be equal to 3 moles, which is the same as the number of moles of CH4.

From Solution P, the amount of carbonated water is 0.80x (since P is 80% carbonated water). From Solution Q, the amount of carbonated water is 0.55(100 - x) (since Q is 55% carbonated water). The total amount of carbonated water from both solutions in the mixture is the sum of the carbonated water from P and Q, which is equal to 65 (since the mixture is 65% carbonated water).

You will notice that there is always at least as much area it manages to enclose a total of three by enclosing three square areas (i.e., each area fencing elements of the same size to enclose it) as if it were three different, rectangular would encircle an area (i.e., use two different elements for each of the three areas). Why is this is so? When does it not matter how he fences the rectangles, in terms of the sum of the areas?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We have three types of fences with lengths (a), (b), and (c), and we have 4 pieces of each type. We need to form three rectangular areas using these fences. The problem states that the total area is maximized when the rectangles are squares, i.e., when each rectangle uses four pieces of the same type of fence. 2. **Formulating the Problem:**    Let's denote the lengths of the fences as (a), (b), and (c). We need to form three rectangles using these lengths. The possible configurations for the rectangles are:    - Using all four pieces of the same type for each rectangle, forming squares.    - Using different combinations of the lengths to form rectangles. 3. **Calculating the Area for Squares:**    If we use all four pieces of the same type for each rectangle, we form squares with side lengths (a), (b), and (c). The areas of these squares are:    [    text{Area of square with side } a = a^2    ]    [    text{Area of square with side } b = b^2    ]    [    text{Area of square with side } c = c^2    ]    Therefore, the total area when using squares is:    [    A_{text{total}} = a^2 + b^2 + c^2    ] 4. **Calculating the Area for Rectangles:**    If we use different combinations of the lengths to form rectangles, we need to consider all possible configurations. For example:    - Using (a) and (b) to form a rectangle with sides (a) and (b), the area is (ab).    - Using (b) and (c) to form a rectangle with sides (b) and (c), the area is (bc).    - Using (c) and (a) to form a rectangle with sides (c) and (a), the area is (ca).    The total area for these configurations is:    [    A_{text{total}} = ab + bc + ca    ] 5. **Comparing the Areas:**    We need to show that the total area when using squares is always greater than or equal to the total area when using rectangles. This can be shown using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality), which states that for any non-negative real numbers (x) and (y):    [    frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy}    ]    Applying this to our problem:    [    frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} geq ab    ]    [    frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} geq bc    ]    [    frac{c^2 + a^2}{2} geq ca    ]    Adding these inequalities, we get:    [    frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} + frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} + frac{c^2 + a^2}{2} geq ab + bc + ca    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 geq ab + bc + ca    ]    Therefore, the total area when using squares is always greater than or equal to the total area when using rectangles. 6. **When Does It Not Matter:**    The equality holds when (a = b = c). In this case, the total area is the same regardless of how the fences are used to form the rectangles.

When A and B work together, they can complete ( frac{1}{14} + frac{1}{35} ) of the work in one day. To find the common denominator, we can use 14 * 35 = 490. So we convert the fractions to have the same denominator: ( frac{1}{14} = frac{35}{490} ) ( frac{1}{35} = frac{14}{490} ) Now, we add the two fractions: ( frac{35}{490} + frac{14}{490} = frac{49}{490} ) This simplifies to: ( frac{49}{490} = frac{1}{10} ) This means that A and B together can complete ( frac{1}{10} ) of the work in one day.

Denote the first digit of each number by ( a ). Therefore, we can write:    [    100a leq x_i < 100(a+1) quad text{for} quad i = 1,2,3,4    ] 3. **Boundaries for the sum:**    Using the inequalities given for each ( x_i ), we derive:    [    4 times 100a leq S < 4 times 100(a+1)    ]    This simplifies to:    [    400a leq S < 400(a+1)    ] 4. **Form expressions using the sum and inequalities:**    Let’s express ( S ) in terms of ( x_i ) and ( a ):    [    4x_i + 300a leq S < 4x_i + 300(a+1)    ] 5. **Divide the sum ( S ) by ( x_i ):**    [    1 + frac{300a}{x_i} leq frac{S}{x_i} < 1 + frac{300(a+1)}{x_i}    ]    For simplicity, we approximate it further:    [    1 + frac{3a}{a+1} < frac{S}{x_i} < 4 + frac{3}{a}    ] 6. **Consider specific cases:**    For ( a=1 ):    [    2.5 < frac{S}{x_i} < 7    ]    For ( a geq 2 ):    [    3 < frac{S}{x_i} < 5.5    ] 7. **Evaluate possibilities:**    Given ( a geq 2 ), feasible integer values within ( 3 < frac{S}{x_i} < 5.5 ) are 4 and 5.

The distance between any two adjacent trees is 1 meter.

Then this means ( a_{p-n} + a_n = a_{q-n} + a_n = r ) for some prime ( r ).    Since ( p > q ge 3 ), this means there is a positive integer ( k ) which lies strictly between ( p ) and ( q ), where ( k ) is composite. Since ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots ) is an increasing sequence, this means that ( a_{k-n} + a_n = r ), which implies that ( a_{k-n} + a_n ) is prime.    However, from ( P(k-n, n) ):    [    tau(k) = tau(a_{k-n} + a_n) implies tau(k) = 2    ]    which implies that ( k ) is prime, which is a contradiction. (blacksquare) 4. Now, we prove Claim 2. Let ( m ) be the smallest prime such that ( 2^{m-2} > p ), and let ( S ) be the set of all positive integers less than ( 2^{m-2} ) which are of the form ( q-n ) for some prime ( q ), and ( T ) be the set ( {s_k mid k in S} ).    Since ( s_k < s_{2^{m-2}} = 2^{m-2} ), this means all the elements of ( T ) must be less than ( 2^{m-2} ) as well. We know that all of the elements from ( T ) must be of the form ( p-n ) as well, which implies that ( T subseteq S ).    Furthermore, according to Subclaim 2.1, we find that ( a_{p-n} ne a_{q-n} ) for any primes ( p ) and ( q ) satisfying ( p > q > n ge 2 ). This implies that all the elements of ( T ) are distinct. This shows that ( |S| = |T| ), which implies that ( S = T ).    Therefore, ( a_{p-n} = p-n ) for all ( n ) and prime ( p ) satisfying ( p > n ge 2 ). (blacksquare) 5. Finally, we use induction to complete the proof that ( a_n = n ) for all positive integers ( n ).    The base cases are when ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ), which easily follows from Claim 1.    For the inductive step, suppose that we know that ( a_n = n ) for all ( n = 1, 2, 3, ldots, k ).    According to Bertrand's Postulate, there exists a prime ( p ) such that ( k < p < 2k ). Also, ( p - k < 2k - k = k ). From our induction hypothesis, this implies that ( a_{p-k} = p - k ). Hence, from Claim 2:    [    a_k + a_{p-k} = p implies a_k + (p - k) = p implies a_k = k    ]    which completes the proof.

First, we rewrite (x^2 + 3x + 1) and (y^2 + 3y + 1) in a convenient form: [ x^2 + 3x + 1 = x(x + 3) + 1 ] Similarly, [ y^2 + 3y + 1 = y(y + 3) + 1 ] 2. Notice that for any integer (x), (x(x + 3)) is always even because it is the product of two consecutive integers and one of them is definitely even. Therefore, (x(x + 3)) is even, meaning (x(x + 3) + 1) is always odd since an even number plus one is odd. 3. Consequently, (x^2 + 3x + 1) and (y^2 + 3y + 1) are always odd for any integer (x) and (y). 4.

Since p and q together take 15 days to complete the work, the combined work done by p and q in one day is ( frac{1}{15} ) of the total work. We can now set up an equation to represent the combined work of p and q: [ W_p + W_q = frac{1}{15} ] Substituting ( W_p ) with ( frac{1}{x} ) and ( W_q ) with ( frac{W_p}{1.5} ) (since p is 50% more efficient than q), we get: [ frac{1}{x} + frac{frac{1}{x}}{1.5} = frac{1}{15} ] Simplifying the equation: [ frac{1}{x} + frac{2}{3x} = frac{1}{15} ] [ frac{3}{3x} + frac{2}{3x} = frac{1}{15} ] [ frac{5}{3x} = frac{1}{15} ] Now, we can solve for ( x ): [ 5 = frac{3x}{15} ] [ 5 = frac{x}{5} ] [ x = 5 times 5 ] [ x = 25 ] Therefore, p can complete the work alone in boxed{25}  days."},{"instruction":"The zeros of the function y=x^2x2 are ( ) A: 1, 2 B: 1, 2 C: 1, 2 D: No zero","output":"Set y=0, we get x^2-x-2=0, thus x=-1 or x=2.

The derivative is given by: [f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ln x + mx + n) = frac{1}{x} + m.] Considering the sign of m is negative, we analyze the behavior of f'(x) in two intervals based on the sign of f'(x): 1. For 0 < x < -frac{1}{m}, we have f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. 2. For x > -frac{1}{m}, we have f'(x) < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing in this interval. Therefore, the function f(x) attains its maximum value at x = -frac{1}{m}.

The maximum value of g(x) occurs at x = e^{-2}, giving g(e^{-2}) = e^{-2}.

It is clear that the altitudes AP and MU of triangles ABC and MBC are in the same proportion as the segments AA_1 and MA_1, therefore [ frac{d_a'}{d_a' + R_a} = frac{MA_1}{AA_1} = frac{S_{triangle MBC}}{S_{triangle ABC}} ] Similarly, [ frac{d_b'}{d_b' + R_b} = frac{S_{triangle MAC}}{S_{triangle ABC}} quad text{and} quad frac{d_c'}{d_c' + R_c} = frac{S_{triangle MAB}}{S_{triangle ABC}}] Thus, [ frac{d_a'}{d_a' + R_a} + frac{d_b'}{d_b' + R_b} + frac{d_c'}{d_c' + R_c} = frac{S_{triangle MBC} + S_{triangle MAC} + S_{triangle MAB}}{S_{triangle ABC}} = 1 ] i.e., [ frac{1}{1 + frac{R_a}{d_a'}} + frac{1}{1 + frac{R_b}{d_b'}} + frac{1}{1 + frac{R_c}{d_c'}} = 1, ] or [ frac{1}{1 + x_a} + frac{1}{1 + x_b} + frac{1}{1 + x_c} = 1 ] where for simplicity, let us denote frac{R_a}{d_a'} = x_a, frac{R_b}{d_b'} = x_b, and frac{R_c}{d_c'} = x_c.

What is the maximum number of pairwise dissimilar numbers that can be chosen?","output":"To determine the maximum number of pairwise non-similar 100-digit numbers composed only of the digits 1 and 2, we need to understand the conditions under which two such numbers are considered similar.  Let's prove that two numbers are similar if and only if the count of 1's at each residue position 5k + r (where k ranges from 0 to 19, and r ranges from 0 to 4) is the same for both numbers.   Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Understanding residue classes:**     - Effectively, the number can be thought of as divided into segments where each segment corresponds to positions of the form 5k + r.     - There are five such segments based on the value of r: r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 2. **Classifying similar numbers:**     - The class of similar numbers is uniquely determined by an ordered 5-tuple (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5).     - Here, x_r equals the number of 1's in the positions of the form 5k + r for each r.      3. **Possible values for each tuple entry:**     - Each x_r can take any value from 0 to 20 because the positions of type 5k + r add up to 20 positions in total.     Therefore, the number of such unique 5-tuples is (21^5).  4. **Necessity of the condition:**     - If you apply a swap operation (which is swapping blocks of five consecutive digits), the count of 1's in each segment remains unchanged.      - Henceforth, the total count of 1's in any segment 5k + r remains the same, ensuring the numbers stay similar by definition. 5. **Sufficiency of the condition:**     - If two numbers share the same counts of 1's for all residue positions, any permutation cycle can be reduced to a series of adjacent swaps that ultimately keep the residue counts unchanged.     - By repeatedly applying the defined operation, one number can be transformed into the other (cyclic permutations on 3-cycle basis), proving the sufficiency.

However, from our definition h(f(g(P))) = k(P), and by problem conditions, this should result in an area of zero contradiction to our assumption.

(II) From the problem, for any x_1 > x_2 > 0, x_1-x_2 > 0. From frac{f(x_1)-f(x_2)}{x_1-x_2} > x_1+x_2+4, we get f(x_1)-f(x_2) > (x_1+x_2+4)(x_1-x_2), i.e., f(x_1)- x_1^2-4x_1 > f(x_2)- x_2^2-4x_2. Let g(x)=f(x)-x^2-4x. Since x_1 > x_2 > 0, we have g(x_1) > g(x_2). So the function g(x)=f(x)-x^2-4x is increasing on (0,+infty). Thus, g'(x)=f'(x)-2x-4=frac{2a}{x}+2ax-4geqslant 0 holds on (0,+infty), which implies 2a(frac{1}{x}+x)geqslant 4. Since x > 0, we have ageqslant frac{2}{x+frac{1}{x}}. On (0,+infty), frac{2}{x+frac{1}{x}}leqslant frac{2}{2}=1 (equality holds if and only if x=1). Therefore, the inequality ageqslant frac{2}{x+frac{1}{x}} holds on (0,+infty) if and only if ageqslant 1. Hence, the range of values of a is [1,+infty). (III) From (II), we know that when a=1, g(x)=2ln x+x^2-4x+1 is increasing on (0,+infty). Since g(1)=-2, when x > 1, we have g(x)=2ln x+x^2-4x+1 > -2, i.e., 2ln x > -x^2+4x-3. Let x=frac{n+1}{n}(n > 1,ninmathbb{N}^{*}), then x > 1. Thus, 2lnfrac{n+1}{n} > -frac{(n+1)^2}{n^2}+4frac{n+1}{n}-3=frac{2n-1}{n^2}=frac{2}{n}-frac{1}{n^2} > frac{2}{n}-frac{1}{n(n-1)}=frac{3}{n}-frac{1}{n-1}... Hence, 2lnfrac{3}{2} > frac{3}{2}-frac{1}{1}, 2lnfrac{4}{3} > frac{3}{3}-frac{1}{2}, ..., 2lnfrac{n+1}{n} > frac{3}{n}-frac{1}{n-1}, and 2ln 2 > 1. Adding these up, we get 2ln (n+1) > frac{3}{n}+frac{2}{n-1}+...+frac{2}{2} > frac{2}{n}+frac{2}{n-1}+...+frac{2}{2}. Therefore, boxed{ln (n+1) > frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+...+frac{1}{n}(n > 1,ninmathbb{N}^{*})}."},{"instruction":"There are 5 apples, 4 bananas and 6 grapes.

Solving this quadratic equation, we find that cosalpha can be either 2 or -frac{2}{3}. However, since cosalpha = 2 is not possible within the domain of cosine function values (which lie between -1 and 1), we discard it and only consider cosalpha = -frac{2}{3}.

The sum of the digits of ( m ) can range from ( n ) (if all digits are 1) to ( 9n ) (if all digits are 9).

The train is 140 meters long and is traveling at a speed of 98 kilometers per hour (kmph). To find the time, we first need to convert the speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s), because the length of the train is given in meters. 1 kilometer = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, to convert 98 kmph to m/s: 98 kmph * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 98 * (1000 / 3600) m/s 98 * (10 / 36) m/s 98 * (5 / 18) m/s (98 * 5) / 18 m/s 490 / 18 m/s 27.22 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the pole using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the pole is equal to the length of the train, which is 140 meters.

So, the total income from children's tickets is ( 60 times 1.50 ). The total number of seats in the theater is 200, so the number of adults is ( 200 - 60 = 140 ). The total income from adult tickets is ( 140 times A ). According to the information given, the total ticket income was 510.

Place the hexagon on the coordinate plane such that edge a is parallel to the x-axis and the intersection between edge a and edge f is at the origin.  3. Assume that edge b lies in the first quadrant.  Start at the origin (0,0) and travel along all six sides of the hexagon. By vector addition, the coordinates must satisfy certain conditions. 4. Traveling along all six sides, the final x coordinate must be zero. This translates to the following vector equation for the x-coordinate sum:    [    a + frac{b}{2} - frac{c}{2} - d - frac{e}{2} + frac{f}{2} = 0    ] 5.

To find the relationship between 'x' and the sum of 'a' and 'b', we can manipulate this equation: 1/a + 1/b = (b + a) / (ab) = 6 Since we know that a + b = 6x, we can substitute this into the equation: (b + a) / (ab) = 6x / (ab) = 6 Now, we can solve for 'x': 6x / (ab) = 6 x / (ab) = 1 x = ab So, the value 'x' is equal to the product of 'a' and 'b'.

We start by assuming the three consecutive odd numbers can be represented as: - (2x - 1) - (2x + 1) - (2x + 3) The sum of these numbers is: [ (2x - 1) + (2x + 1) + (2x + 3) = 6x + 3 ] This sum is given to be equal to the fourth power of a single-digit number. We will evaluate this for all possible single-digit numbers. Single-digit odd numbers are (3, 5, 7, 9). 1.

In this case, the chosen two-term sum is at least 1. Since all terms are positive and there is at least one more term, the total sum is always greater than 1.     On the other hand, choose i such that a_{i+2} is the largest value among the a_i values. In this case, the chosen two-term sum is at most 1.

A T-shaped tetromino consists of 4 unit squares. 2. **Initial Observation:**    Each T-shaped tetromino covers 4 squares. Therefore, the total number of squares on the board, ( n^2 ), must be divisible by 4 for the board to be completely covered by tetrominoes. This implies:    [    4 mid n^2    ]    Since ( n^2 ) is divisible by 4, ( n ) must be even. Hence:    [    2 mid n    ] 3. **Checkerboard Argument:**    Consider a checkerboard coloring of the ( n times n ) board. Each T-shaped tetromino covers exactly 3 squares of one color and 1 square of the other color. This means that the number of squares of each color covered by the tetrominoes must be balanced. 4. **Balancing the Colors:**    Since each tetromino covers 3 squares of one color and 1 square of the other, the total number of squares of each color must be balanced. For an ( n times n ) board, there are ( frac{n^2}{2} ) squares of each color.

In any case, ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) is odd, implying that ( p ) is an odd prime. 3. Consider the difference of the two expressions:    [    x^2 + 3xy + y^2 - (x^2 + xy + y^2) = 2xy    ]    Since ( p ) divides both ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) and ( x^2 + 3xy + y^2 ), it must also divide their difference:    [    p mid 2xy    ] 4.

Therefore, ( p mid x + y ). 7. Since ( p mid x - y ) and ( p mid x + y ), it follows that ( p mid 2x ). Given that ( p ) is odd, ( p mid x ). 8. Similarly, since ( p mid x - y ) and ( p mid x + y ), it follows that ( p mid 2y ). Given that ( p ) is odd, ( p mid y ). 9. However, since ( x ) and ( y ) are relatively prime, the only common divisor they have is 1. This leads to a contradiction, as ( p ) cannot divide both ( x ) and ( y ). 10. Therefore, there is no prime ( p ) that divides both ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) and ( x^2 + 3xy + y^2 ). Hence, ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) and ( x^2 + 3xy + y^2 ) are relatively prime.

Therefore, when the boat is moving against the water flow, its effective speed is the difference between its speed in still water and the speed of the water flow. Given: - Speed of the boat in still water = a km/h - Speed of the water flow = 3 km/h The effective speed of the boat against the water flow is calculated as: [ text{Effective speed} = a - 3 , text{km/h} ] The distance traveled by any moving object is given by the product of its speed and the time of travel. Here, the time of travel is 3 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled by the boat against the water flow can be calculated as: [ text{Distance} = text{Effective speed} times text{Time} ] [ text{Distance} = (a - 3) times 3 , text{km} ] [ text{Distance} = 3(a - 3) , text{km} ] Hence, the distance traveled by the boat against the water flow in 3 hours is boxed{3(a-3) , text{km}}."},{"instruction":"The first term of a sequence is  2014 .

Substituting these into (f(x, y)):    [    f(x, y) = frac{(n + alpha) + frac{1}{n + alpha}}{n cdot 0 + n + 0 + 1} = frac{n + alpha + frac{1}{n + alpha}}{n + 1}    ] 7. Simplify the fraction:    [    f(x, y) = 1 + frac{frac{1}{n + alpha}}{n + 1} = 1 + frac{frac{1}{n + alpha}}{n + 1}    ] 8. To analyze the maximum value, notice:    [    frac{frac{1}{n + alpha}}{n + 1} leq frac{frac{1}{1 + alpha}}{1 + 1} = frac{1 - alpha}{(1 + alpha)(1 + 1)}    ]     9. Since (alpha in [0, 1)):    [    frac{1}{2(1 + alpha)} leq frac{1}{4}    ] 10. Therefore:     [     f(x, y) leq 1 + frac{1}{4} = frac{5}{4}     ]     As (x to 2^{-}), (f(x, y) to frac{5}{4}). 11. For the minimum value:     [     f(x, y) = frac{(n + alpha) + frac{1}{n + alpha}}{n + 1} geq frac{n + frac{1}{n}}{n + 1}     ]      12. Simplify the right-hand side:     [     frac{n^2 + 1}{n(n + 1)} = 1 - frac{1}{n(n + 1)} cdot frac{1}{3 + (n - 1) + frac{2}{n - 1}}     ]      13.

Prove that its legs are equal to (2mn) and (m^2  n^2), and the hypotenuse is equal to (m^2 + n^2), where (m) and (n) are natural numbers.","output":"We begin by considering a right-angled triangle with integer side lengths a, b (the legs), and c (the hypotenuse). We note that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a, b, and c is 1. This situation describes a Pythagorean triangle, which is a special case of a right triangle. 1. **Parity Condition**:    - Both a and b cannot be odd.     - If a and b were both odd, then a^2 + b^2 would be even (sum of two odd squares), but not divisible by 4 (since odd squares leave a remainder of 1 modulo 4). Thus, a^2 + b^2 would have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, which contradicts the fact that c^2 (a perfect square) must leave a remainder of either 0 or 1 modulo 4.          Therefore, one of a and b must be even. For definiteness, let us assume a is even. 2. **Expressing Terms**:    - Let a = 2m, where m is an integer.    - Since c is the hypotenuse and odd:      [      c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = (2m)^2 + b^2 = 4m^2 + b^2      ]    - We can represent b and c in terms of another pair of integers r and s:      [      c + b = 2r quad text{and} quad c - b = 2s      ]      These equations imply:      [      c = r + s quad text{and} quad b = r - s      ] 3. **Solving for r and s**:    - Substituting these into our equation for c^2, we get:      [      c^2 = (r + s)^2 = r^2 + 2rs + s^2      ]      and      [      a^2 = 4m^2 = 4rs implies m^2 = rs      ]    - This shows that rs = m^2. Since the GCD of a, b, and c is 1, r and s must be coprime (they have no common divisor other than 1). 4. **Concluding Values**:    - Since r and s are both coprime and their product is a perfect square, they themselves must be perfect squares. Let us assign:      [      r = n^2 quad text{and} quad s = k^2      ]      However, since we need positive integer side lengths and ensuring a remains even:      [      b = m^2 - n^2 quad text{and} quad c = m^2 + n^2      ]      Thus, we have:      [      a = 2mn      ]      summarizing the results:      [      boxed{a = 2mn, ; b = m^2 - n^2, ; c = m^2 + n^2}      ] 5. **Verification**:    - To show that a^2 + b^2 = c^2, we substitute:      [      (2mn)^2 + (m^2 - n^2)^2 = 4m^2n^2 + m^4 - 2m^2n^2 + n^4 = m^4 + 2m^2n^2 + n^4 = (m^2 + n^2)^2 = c^2      ] This verifies that our derived formulas satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and thus the proof is complete.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A train 110 m long is running with a speed of 50 km/h.

Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 13.89 m/s + 1.39 m/s = 15.28 m/s Now, we can find the time it takes for the train to pass the man by dividing the length of the train by the relative speed.

We need to find the length of the measured diagonal. 1. **Applying the triangle inequality theorem:**     The triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides of lengths (a), (b), and (c), the following inequalities must hold:     [     a + b > c     ]     [     a + c > b     ]     [     b + c > a     ]     Additionally, since we are working with a quadrilateral, we need to apply these inequalities to the triangles formed by its sides and its diagonals. 2. **Verify diagonal (7.5):**         If 7.5 is one of the diagonals, let's check the remaining sides to form valid triangles:     - Consider sides (1, 2, 2.8, 5). Try to form two triangles with a diagonal of (7.5):     However, none of these combinations will satisfy all of the triangle inequalities simultaneously. Therefore, (7.5) cannot be the length of the diagonal. 3. **Verify diagonal (5):**     If 5 is one of the diagonals, let's check the remaining sides to form valid triangles:     - Consider sides (1, 2, 2.8, 7.5). Try to form two triangles with a diagonal of (5):     Checking the possible combinations, you will find that no valid combinations satisfy all triangle inequalities simultaneously. Therefore, (5) cannot be the length of the diagonal. 4. **Verify diagonal (1):**     If 1 is one of the diagonals, let's check the remaining sides to form valid triangles:     - Consider sides (2, 2.8, 5, 7.5). Try to form two triangles with a diagonal of (1):     Checking these sides, it is clear that (1) is too small to fit as a diagonal while satisfying all triangle inequalities. Therefore, (1) cannot be the length of the diagonal. 5. **Verify diagonal (2):**     If 2 is one of the diagonals, let's check the remaining sides to form valid triangles:     - Consider sides (1, 2.8, 5, 7.5). Try to form two triangles with a diagonal of (2):     No valid combinations satisfying the triangle inequalities exist with (2) as the diagonal.

How many different selections are there?","output":"1. We are given a problem involving 36 identical gifts placed in 8 different bags, with the number of gifts in each bag being at least 1 and all different. Hence, we can distribute the gifts among the bags as follows: each bag contains (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) gifts respectively. This is confirmed by checking:    [    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = frac{8 times (8 + 1)}{2} = 36    ] 2. In this problem, we need to choose some bags such that the total number of gifts in the chosen bags is a multiple of 8. Summarize the possible distributions based on multiples of 8.  Case 1: Each child gets 1 gift (Total = 8 gifts) [ 8 = 8 ] [ 8 = 1 +7 ] [ 8 = 2 + 6 ] [ 8 = 3 + 5 ] [ 8 = 1 + 2 + 5 ] [ 8 = 1 + 3 + 4  ] Thus, there are 6 combinations in this case.

This implies that ( A^T = -A ). 2. **Eigenvalues of Antisymmetric Matrices**:    The eigenvalues of a real antisymmetric matrix are either zero or purely imaginary. To see why, suppose ( lambda ) is an eigenvalue of ( A ) with corresponding eigenvector ( v ). Then:    [    Av = lambda v    ]    Taking the conjugate transpose of both sides, we get:    [    v^* A^* = overline{lambda} v^*    ]    Since ( A ) is real and antisymmetric, ( A^* = A^T = -A ).

Since the two lines are perpendicular, the first condition is satisfied. However, line l_1 does not pass through the point (-3, -1), so we discard this solution. For the case where b neq 0, since lines l_1 and l_2 are perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of each other. Therefore, we have  frac{a}{b} cdot (1 - a) = -1. This simplifies to a(a - 1) = -b. Additionally, we know that l_1 goes through the point (-3, -1), which leads to the second equation: -3a + b + 4 = 0.
