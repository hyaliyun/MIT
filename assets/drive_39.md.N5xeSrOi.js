Thus, the boundary of each square is painted black, except for four points of tangent contact of the inscribed circle, and the boundary of each circle is painted white, except for the four vertices of the inscribed square. - Let's denote the side of the original square as (a). The side of the smaller square is (frac{a}{sqrt{2}}). - Therefore, the lengths of the sides of the squares tend to 0 (see Fact 27 from the referenced material). Consequently, all points except the center will eventually be colored. Color the center point in black. 5. **Similarity of Point Sets:** - It is evident that the set of black points of the square is similar to the set of black points of the circle with a similarity coefficient ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ). - Similarly, the set of white points of the square coincides with the set of white points of the inscribed circle. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_6455f48598646f41a890g-310.jpg?height=343&width=341&top_left_y=353&top_left_x=128) a) ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_6455f48598646f41a890g-310.jpg?height=341&width=343&top_left_y=774&top_left_x=129) b) # Conclusion: Thus, we can indeed color all points of a square and a circle in black and white in such a way that the sets of white points of these figures are similar to each other, and the sets of black points are also similar to each other.

Now, replacing y with f(y) in the original equation gives: [f(x + f(f(y))) = x - f(y)] Using the result that f(f(y)) = -y, we have: [f(x - y) = x - f(y)] Next, if we set y = 0, using our earlier established f(f(0)) = -0 = 0 and the bijectivity, assume f(0) = 0, then: [f(x) = x - f(0) = x] Put this back into the original equation to check: [f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) = x + y] However, we are supposed to have: [f(x + y) = x - y] Clearly, our assumption that f(y) = y leads to a contradiction because it does not satisfy x - y = x + y. Hence no function matches the condition f(x + f(y)) = x - y. Furthermore, our exploratory formula did not provide any alternative solutions. Conclusion: The function f(x) = x - f(0) failed to satisfy f(x + f(y)) = x - y under the additional assumption that f(0) = 0 led to contradictory outputs when checked against the original functional equation.

To prove: The sum of all the numbers on the chessboard is zero. Steps for the Solution: 1. **Analyze the Sum of Each Row:** - Let's consider one row of the chessboard. Each row has eight numbers. - In each row, four numbers are positive and four numbers are negative. - Let's call these numbers (a, b, c, d, e, f, g,) and (h). 2. **Pairing the Numbers:** - Choose arbitrary pairing of four of these numbers that have a plus sign, let's name them (a, b, c,) and (d). - The numbers with a minus sign are (e, f, g,) and (h). - The sum for one row can be written as: [ S_{text{row}} = a + b + c + d - e - f - g - h ] 3. **Generalize for Each Row:** - Since the selection of plus and minus is arbitrary but fixed to four positives and four negatives, the symmetrical nature ensures that each row's combination will yield consistent results across the entire board.

Two other points, ( B ) and ( C ), are also on this circle such that ( angle BAC = frac{pi}{3} ). Find the equation of the locus of the centroid ( G ) of triangle ( triangle ABC ). 1. **Introduction of coordinates and setup:** Let ( G(x, y) ) be the centroid of ( triangle ABC ). Given that points ( B ) and ( C ) are such that ( angle BAC = frac{pi}{3} ), it implies that the angle subtended by arc ( BC ) at the origin ( O(0,0) ) is ( 2 times frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{3} ). 2. **Chord properties and parameterization:** The point ( D(x_0, y_0) ) is the midpoint of the chord ( BC ). Since ( angle BOC = frac{2pi}{3} ), the midpoint ( D ) has coordinates that satisfy: [ x_0^2 + y_0^2 = left( frac{3}{2} right)^2 ] This comes from the fact that the distance from the origin to the midpoint of the chord of a circle with radius ( R ) subtending a central angle ( 2theta ) is given by ( R cos(theta) ).

This assumption simplifies the problem without losing generality since if ( m ) is even, we can always shift ( k ). 2. **Base case for induction:** For ( n=1 ), the statement is obvious. There are many values of ( k ) such that ( 2^k - m ) is a prime number, hence having exactly one prime factor. 3. **Inductive hypothesis:** Assume that for a given ( n ), there is an integer ( k ) such that ( 2^k - m ) has at least ( n ) distinct prime factors. Let ( A = 2^k - m ), which, by assumption, has at least ( n ) distinct prime factors. 4. **Inductive step:** Consider ( 2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m ) where ( varphi ) is Euler's totient function. [ 2^{k + varphi(A^2)} equiv 2^k pmod{A^2} ] Therefore: [ 2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m equiv 2^k - m = A pmod{A^2} ] Hence, ( 2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m = A times q ) for some integer ( q ). 5. **Prime factor analysis:** Since ( 2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m ) is divisible by ( A ), [ frac{2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m}{A} equiv 1 pmod{A} ] This means that ( frac{2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m}{A} ) is coprime to ( A ). Thus, the prime factors of ( frac{2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m}{A} ) are not any of the prime factors of ( A ). 6. **Conclusion:** Since ( A = 2^k - m ) has ( n ) distinct prime factors, and ( frac{2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m}{A} ) introduces at least one new distinct prime factor, [ 2^{k + varphi(A^2)} - m ] has at least ( n+1 ) distinct prime factors.

Point (T) is the foot of the perpendicular drawn from point (B) to line (XY). We need to prove that all such points (T) lie on a single line. 1. **Construct the triangle and additional geometrical elements:** - Let point (H) be the foot of the altitude from (B) to (AC). - Extend the right triangle (AHB) to a rectangle (AHBK). - We aim to show that points (T) lie on a line (KH). 2. **Consider the point (T') on line (KH):** - Draw (T'B) perpendicular to (XY). Let this perpendicular intersect (AC) at point (X), and the extension of (BC) at point (Y'). 3. **Analyze the angles:** - If (angle ABX + angle CXY' = 90^circ), then (Y = Y') uniquely determined by (X). - Therefore, point (T) will coincide with (T') and, consequently, must lie on line (KH). 4. **Prove that (BT' perp XH) and (T'B perp XY'):** - Because (T'B perp XY) and passes through (B), quadrilateral (BXHT') is cyclic if (X) lies on segment (CH). - Similarly, (BHXT') if (X) lies on segment (AH), making (angle BXH = angle BHT' = 90^circ). 5. **Equality of angles:** - (angle ABX + angle CXY' = angle ABX + angle T'BH = angle T'BX + angle ABH = angle T'BX + angle T'HB = angle T'BX + angle T'XB = 90^circ). 6. **Conclusion:** - Given (angle ABX + angle CXY' = 90^circ), points (Y) and (Y') coincide.

To find where u(x) is increasing or decreasing, we set u'(x) > 0. Considering x > frac{1}{2}, we have x > sqrt{e}. Thus, u(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval left(frac{1}{2}, sqrt{e}right) and monotonically increasing in the interval left(sqrt{e}, +inftyright).

Therefore, v(x) must have a minimum at x = sqrt{e}. The derivative of v(x) is: v'(x) = frac{2e}{x} + 8x - p = frac{8x^2 - px + 2e}{x}. Since v'(sqrt{e}) = 0, solving for p yields p = 10 sqrt{e}. Substituting back into v'(x), we get v'(x) = frac{8(x - sqrt{e})(x - frac{sqrt{e}}{2})}{x}. Since x > frac{1}{2}, v(x) is monotonically decreasing in left(frac{1}{2}, sqrt{e}right) and monotonically increasing in left(sqrt{e}, +inftyright). Thus, the minimum value of v(x) is found at x = sqrt{e}: v(sqrt{e}) = h(sqrt{e}) - g(sqrt{e}) = -5e - q = 0. Solving the equation for q gives q = -5e.

The slope of l_1 is sinalpha, and the slope of l_2 is 2. For these lines to coincide by translation, we need sinalpha = 2, which is impossible as the sine function's range is [-1, 1]. Therefore, option A is incorrect. - **Option B (Perpendicularity)**: Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. The slope of l_1 is sinalpha, and the slope of l_2 is 2. The product of their slopes is 2sinalpha. This product can be equal to -1 if sinalpha = -frac{1}{2}. Since sinalpha can indeed be -frac{1}{2} (for example, when alpha = 7pi/6), option B is incorrect because it's possible for them to be perpendicular. - **Option C (Isosceles Right Triangle)**: The question here is whether l_1 or l_2 can form the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with the x-axis. This is possible for l_1 if sinalpha = 1 or sinalpha = -1, which corresponds to alpha = pi/2 or alpha = 3pi/2 respectively. This is not fulfilling the same criteria for l_2 since its slope is fixed at 2. Thus, l_2 cannot form an isosceles right triangle with the x-axis. Consequently, option C is incorrect. - **Option D (Rotation)**: This option posits that the lines can coincide by rotating l_1 around a certain point on itself. Since rotation can change the direction of a line without affecting its slope, l_1 can be rotated to align with l_2, provided they go through the same point before and after rotation. The slopes are irrelevant here because rotation can achieve any desired angle, provided a common point exists. This can indeed be accomplished by rotating l_1 around the point of intersection with l_2, making option D the correct answer.

Given 2007 followed by three digits abc, we can represent N as: [ N = 2007000 + 100a + 10b + c ] where a, b, and c are single digits forming the three-digit suffix that makes N minimal and divisible by 105. 2. **Check divisibility requirement (105)**: Since 2007000 is already given, we need to determine the smallest suffix abc such that when added to 2007000, the number is divisible by 105. Determine the remainder of 2007000 divided by 105: [ 2007000 div 105 Rightarrow 2007000 = 105 times k + r ] Calculate this quotient and remainder: [ 2007000 div 105 approx 19114.2857 quad (text{integer part of quotient is } 19114) ] Therefore, [ 2007000 = 105 times 19114 + r ] We calculate r: [ r = 2007000 - (105 times 19114) ] Simplify the above: [ 2007000 - 2006970 = 30 ] This implies: [ 2007000 equiv 30 pmod{105} ] 3. **Find the minimal integer abc**: We need to find a number x, where x = 100a + 10b + c, such that: [ 30 + x equiv 0 pmod{105} ] This simplifies to: [ x equiv -30 pmod{105} ] We need the smallest non-negative x. The smallest non-negative solution is: [ x = 105 - 30 = 75 ] Thus, the suffix abc = 075. 4. **Conclusion**: When we append 075 to 2007, the resulting number 2007075 is the smallest number divisible by 3, 5, and 7.

Define the family of all subsets of ( I ) that consist of 19 members as ( mathscr{A} ), and denote ( mathscr{B} ) as the family of all 20-member subsets of ( I ). For any subset ( A in mathscr{A} ) (which contains 19 people), let's denote the unique common friend of these 19 people by ( a = f(A) ). If there exists a subset ( B in mathscr{B} ) (which contains 20 people) with the property that one of its members, say ( a ), is the common friend of the remaining 19 members (( f(B setminus { a }) = a )), we call ( B ) a \\"good set\\".

We aim to show that for any ( B in mathscr{B}_{0} ), there exists a member ( a ) in ( B ) such that ( f(B setminus { a }) = a ). This leads us to define a mapping ( g: mathscr{B}_{0} to mathscr{A} ) by associating each ( B in mathscr{B}_{0} ) with ( g(B) = B setminus { a } ). Now, let's prove that ( g ) is injective: 1. Consider two distinct sets ( B_{1}, B_{2} in mathscr{B}_{0} ) such that ( B_{1} neq B_{2} ). 2. Let ( a_{1} in B_{1} ) and ( a_{2} in B_{2} ) be such that ( f(B_{1} setminus { a_{1} }) = a_{1} ) and ( f(B_{2} setminus { a_{2} }) = a_{2} ). 3. Assume ( g(B_{1}) = g(B_{2}) ), which implies that ( B_{1} setminus {a_{1}} = B_{2} setminus {a_{2}} ). 4. Consequently, ( a_{1} = f(B_{1} setminus { a_{1} }) = f(B_{2} setminus { a_{2} }) = a_{2} ). 5. Therefore, ( B_{1} setminus {a_{1}} = B_{2} setminus {a_{2}} ) and ( a_{1} = a_{2} ) implies ( B_{1} = B_{2} ), which is a contradiction. Thus, ( g ) is injective.

Step 1: Understand the effect of a < 0 on the quadratic function. Since a < 0, the parabola opens downwards. This means that the vertex of the parabola represents the maximum point of the function. Step 2: Identify the vertex of the parabola. The given quadratic function is in the form y=a(x-1)^2+c, indicating that the vertex of the parabola is at (1, c). This means that the function value at x=1, which is y_{2}, is the maximum value of the function. Step 3: Compare the function values at x=sqrt{2}, x=1, and x=0. - At x=1, we have the maximum function value, y_{2}. - Since the parabola is symmetric about the line x=1 and opens downwards, the function values decrease as we move away from x=1. Therefore, the function values at x=sqrt{2} and x=0 are less than y_{2}. - Given that x=sqrt{2} and x=0 are equidistant from x=1, their function values are the same due to the symmetry of the parabola. However, since we need to establish a strict inequality, we consider the nature of the quadratic function and the given inputs. The confusion in the symmetry argument arises from a misinterpretation. Instead, we should focus on the fact that since y_{2} is the maximum (vertex), and as we move to x=0 or x=sqrt{2}, the values decrease from this maximum. The correct interpretation is that y_{1} and y_{3} are both less than y_{2}, but the question requires a distinct ordering. Step 4: Correcting the interpretation error in Step 3. Given the downward opening of the parabola and its symmetry about x=1, we know y_{2} is the maximum value. However, the original solution's conclusion about y_{1} being the smallest is incorrect based on the provided information. The correct approach is to recognize that y_{2} is the maximum, and without additional information about c or specific values, we cannot accurately rank y_{1} and y_{3} based solely on the given function's form and the values of x provided. The critical insight is that y_{2} being the maximum is the key takeaway. Given the constraints and aiming to stay true to the original solution's intent while correcting the logical flow: - y_{2} is the maximum value due to the vertex position. - Both y_{1} and y_{3} are less than y_{2}, but without loss of generality or additional specific information, the direct comparison between y_{1} and y_{3} was not the focus. The correct conclusion, aligning with the original solution's intent and correcting the logical flow, is that y_{2} is the maximum, and y_{1} and y_{3} are less than y_{2}.

The cost for X kgs at the original price is: Cost_original = X * P The cost for (X + 12) kgs at the reduced price is: Cost_reduced = (X + 12) * R Since the amount of money spent is the same (Rs. 2500) before and after the price reduction, we can set the two costs equal to each other: Cost_original = Cost_reduced X * P = (X + 12) * R Substituting the value of R from the first equation, we get: X * P = (X + 12) * P * 0.63 Now, we can solve for X: X * P = 0.63 * X * P + 0.63 * 12 * P X * P - 0.63 * X * P = 0.63 * 12 * P 0.37 * X * P = 0.63 * 12 * P Divide both sides by 0.37 * P to solve for X: X = (0.63 * 12 * P) / (0.37 * P) X = (0.63 * 12) / 0.37 X = 7.56 / 0.37 X ≈ 20.43 So, the housewife could originally buy approximately 20.43 kgs of oil for Rs. 2500. Now, we can find the reduced price per kg (R) by dividing the total amount spent (Rs. 2500) by the total quantity of oil she can now buy (X + 12 kgs): R = 2500 / (20.43 + 12) R = 2500 / 32.43 R ≈ 77.08 Therefore, the reduced price per kg of oil is approximately Rs. boxed{77.08} ."},{"instruction":"Given the line y=frac{1}{2}x2 intersects the circle x^2+y^22x=15 at points A and B, find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of chord AB.","output":"This problem involves the standard equation of a circle, conversion between general and standard forms, and point-slope form of a line equation, demonstrating mathematical transformation thinking.

For ( a_2 ), we have: [ a_2 = sum_{i in S_2} a_i ] The multiples of 2 in the sequence are ( a_2 ) and ( a_3 ) (if ( a_3 ) is even). Since ( a_2 ) is a multiple of 2, we have: [ a_2 = a_2 + a_3 ] This simplifies to: [ a_2 - a_2 = a_3 implies 0 = a_3 ] Therefore, ( a_3 = 0 ). 8.

They can be categorized based on whether (a) is less than or greater than (frac{b}{2}). 4. **Transformation of pairs:** We can construct a mapping of pairs such that: [ (a, b) mapsto (b - a, b) ] - If (a < frac{b}{2}), then (frac{b}{a} > 2) and (b - a > frac{b}{2}). - Conversely, if (a > frac{b}{2}), then (b - a < frac{b}{2}). 5. **One-to-one correspondence:** Every (a) such that (a < frac{b}{2}) corresponds uniquely to a (b - a) that lies in the set where (b - a > frac{b}{2}). Therefore, the transformation: [ (a, b) leftrightarrow (b - a, b) ] maintains a one-to-one correspondence such that the conditions (a < frac{b}{2}) and (a > frac{b}{2}) exchange between the two classifications. 6. **Conclusion:** Hence, there is the same number of pairs ((a, b)) such that (frac{b}{a} > 2) as there are pairs ((a, b)) such that (frac{b}{a} < 2). boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Find all threedigit numbers (overline{abc}) that satisfy (overline{abc} = (a + b + c)^3).","output":"1.

Let ( M ) and (N) be the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from (P) to (AC) and (BD) respectively. 2. **Area Calculation for (triangle ABP)**: We express the area of (triangle ABP) in terms of point (P): [ S_{ABP} = S_{ABE} - S_{AEP} - S_{BEP} ] Since the area of a triangle is (frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}), we have: begin{align*} S_{ABE} &= frac{1}{2} cdot AE cdot BE S_{AEP} &= frac{1}{2} cdot AE cdot EN S_{BEP} &= frac{1}{2} cdot BE cdot EM end{align*} Therefore: [ S_{ABP} = frac{1}{2} cdot (AE cdot BE - AE cdot EN - BE cdot EM) ] 3. **Simplifying the Area Expression**: Given (P) is in (triangle AEB), we rearrange (S_{ABP}): [ S_{ABP} = frac{1}{2} left(AM cdot BN - EM cdot ENright) ] where (AM) and (BN) are the projections of segments on the respective perpendiculars. 4. **Area Calculation for (triangle CDP)**: Similarly, compute the area for (triangle CDP): [ S_{CDP} = frac{1}{2} left(CM cdot DN - EM cdot ENright) ] 5. **Equating Areas**: Since we need triangles (triangle ABP) and (triangle CDP) to have equal areas, the equation becomes: [ S_{ABP} = S_{CDP} implies frac{1}{2} (AM cdot BN - EM cdot EN) = frac{1}{2} (CM cdot DN - EM cdot EN) ] Simplifying: [ AM cdot BN = CM cdot DN ] 6. **Case 1: (ABCD) is Cyclic**: Suppose (ABCD) is cyclic. Then, (P) is the circumcenter. This implies that (M) and (N) are the midpoints of (AC) and (BD), respectively. Thus, (AM = CM), (BN = DN), and so: [ AM cdot BN = CM cdot DN implies S_{ABP} = S_{CDP} ] 7. **Case 2: (ABCD) is Not Cyclic**: Assume without loss of generality (PA = PB > PC = PD). In this case, we have (AM > CM) and (BN > DN), thus: [ AM cdot BN > CM cdot DN implies S_{ABP} > S_{CDP} ] 8. **Alternative Proof**: Alternatively, let (F) and (G) be midpoints of (AB) and (CD), respectively. If (P) lies on the same side of (FG) as (B) and (C), and considering perpendiculars and corresponding angles lead us to similar triangles: [ triangle EFG text{ and } triangle PFG implies text{similarity implies parallelogram, thus cyclic quadrilateral} ] # Conclusion: Therefore, (ABCD) is cyclic if and only if the areas of (triangle ABP) and (triangle CDP) are equal.

Each set ( S_P ) consists of points whose distance from ( P ) is irrational. 2. **Necessary Number of Sets**: - To start, we realize that a single set ( S_P ) cannot cover the entire plane because the set of points a rational distance from ( P ) is non-empty. Thus, we need multiple sets. - Given any two points ( P ) and ( Q ), we need to find a new point ( R ) such that the distance from ( R ) to both ( P ) and ( Q ) is rational.

The points on the plane whose distance from both ( P ) and ( Q ) are rational are dense. For any point ( R ) among these, the distance from any new point ( X ) to both ( P ) and ( Q ) can simultaneously be made rational. 4. **Sufficient Number of Sets**: - Now consider three distinct points ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ): * First, notice that the set where distances from any point ( X ) to ( P ) are rational is countable. * Similarly, the set of points where the distance to ( Q ) is rational is countable. * The intersection of these two countable sets (distances to both ( P ) and ( Q ) are rational) is also countable. * Let ( S_P ) be the set where the distance from ( P ) is irrational, ( S_Q ) be the set where the distance from ( Q ) is irrational, and ( S_R ) be the set where the distance from ( R ) is irrational. 5. **Justification with Three Sets**: - Any point in the plane will be irrationally distanced according to at least one of the sets ( S_P ), ( S_Q ), or ( S_R ). - The union ( S_P cup S_Q cup S_R ) effectively covers the whole plane since every point must fail to match the required rational distance condition for one of the points from the sets (due to uncountability arguments and irrational number density). 6. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the smallest number of such sets whose union is the entire plane is indeed 3: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"instruction":"Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room.

The numbers ( N ) satisfying these conditions can be written in the form ( 2^a times 3^b times 5^c ), where ( a, b, ) and ( c ) are whole numbers less than ( 3 ). This is because if ( a, b, ) or ( c ) were ( 3 ) or more, ( N ) would be divisible by a perfect cube greater than ( 1 ). 3. Therefore, ( a, b, ) and ( c ) can each be ( 0, 1, ) or ( 2 ). This gives us ( 3 ) choices for each of ( a, b, ) and ( c ), resulting in ( 3 times 3 times 3 = 27 ) possible values for ( N ). 4.

Substituting these into the prime factorizations of ( x ) and ( y ), we get: [ x = prod_{p} p^{k_p b} ] and [ y = prod_{p} p^{k_p a} ] 7. Let ( n = prod_{p} p^{k_p} ). Then we can write: [ x = n^b quad text{and} quad y = n^a ] 8. Since ( x ) and ( y ) are integers greater than 1, ( n ) must also be an integer greater than 1.

We need to find the minimum possible sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of this polynomial. 2. **Zero Polynomial Case**: The sum of the absolute values of the coefficients cannot be zero, since this would imply that all coefficients are zero, contradicting the condition that ( p ) is a non-zero polynomial. 3. **Sum Equals 1 Case**: If the sum is 1, then the polynomial must be of the form ( p(x) = pm x^k ) where ( k ) is a non-negative integer. However, this does not satisfy the condition because ( p(1) = pm 1 ) is clearly not divisible by 2016. 4. **Constructing a Suitable Polynomial**: Let us construct a polynomial where the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients is 2. Consider the polynomial ( p(x) = x^5 (x^{48} - 1) ). 5. **Applying Euler's Theorem**: By Euler's theorem, if ( a ) and ( n ) are coprime positive integers, then ( a^{varphi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{n} ), where ( varphi(n) ) is the Euler's totient function. 6. **Prime Factorization of 2016**: The prime factorization of 2016 is: [ 2016 = 2^5 cdot 3^2 cdot 7 ] 7. **Verification with ( 32 = 2^5 )**: - If ( 2 mid n ), then ( 2^5 mid n^5 ), immediately giving ( 2^5 mid p(n) ). - If ( n ) is odd, then ( (gcd(n, 32) = 1) ), and thus by Euler's theorem, ( n^{varphi(32)} = n^{16} equiv 1 pmod{32} ).

Thus, we have the following relationships: [ b = a + d quad text{and} quad c = a + 2d. ] Additionally, we are given that the six quadratic equations with coefficients (a, 2b, 4c) taken in any order have two roots. First, let's determine the discriminant (( Delta )) condition for a quadratic equation to have two real roots. The general form of a quadratic equation is: [ Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0. ] The discriminant of this equation is given by: [ Delta = B^2 - 4AC. ] For the quadratic equation to have two distinct real roots, we require: [ Delta > 0. ] Now, consider the polynomial equations formed with coefficients (a, 2b, 4c): [ begin{aligned} 1. & quad a x^2 + 2b x + 4c = 0, 2. & quad a x^2 + 4c x + 2b = 0, 3. & quad 2b x^2 + a x + 4c = 0, 4. & quad 2b x^2 + 4c x + a = 0, 5. & quad 4c x^2 + a x + 2b = 0, 6. & quad 4c x^2 + 2b x + a = 0. end{aligned} ] Let's compute the discriminants for these quadratic equations: For the first quadratic equation: [ Delta_1 = (2b)^2 - 4 cdot a cdot 4c = 4b^2 - 16ac = 4(b^2 - 4ac). ] For distinct roots: [ b^2 - 4ac > 0. ] Next, consider the second quadratic equation: [ Delta_2 = (4c)^2 - 4 cdot a cdot 2b = 16c^2 - 8ab. ] For distinct roots: [ 16c^2 - 8ab > 0 implies 2c^2 - ab > 0. ] Similarly, consider the third quadratic equation: [ Delta_3 = (a)^2 - 4 cdot 2b cdot 4c = a^2 - 32bc. ] For distinct roots: [ a^2 - 32bc > 0. ] The condition for quadratics formed by other permutations of coefficients should also satisfy the requirements for two distinct roots, giving us four more similar inequalities.

Now we need to equate the exponents of 2 on both sides of the equation: (1 / 2)^n = 1 / 2^22 This implies that: n = 22 So, the value of n is boxed{22} ."},{"instruction":"Peter has 20 books.

When x < 0, g'(x) < 0, g(x) is decreasing; when x > 0, g'(x) > 0, g(x) is increasing. Thus, g(x)_{min}=g(0)=0, so g(x)geqslant 0, and it follows that f(x)geqslant x^{2}+x is true; (3) If f(x) > kx holds for any xin(0,+infty), it is equivalent to k < dfrac{f(x)}{x} holding for any xin(0,+infty).

We want to determine how the fraction ( frac{a+k}{b+k} ) changes when both the numerator ( a ) and the denominator ( b ) are increased (or decreased) by the same positive integer ( k ). 1. Consider the new fraction ( frac{a+k}{b+k} ). We want to find the difference between this new fraction and the original fraction ( frac{a}{b} ): [ frac{a+k}{b+k} - frac{a}{b} ] 2. To find a common denominator and simplify, we follow these steps: [ frac{a+k}{b+k} - frac{a}{b} = frac{(a+k)b - a(b+k)}{b(b+k)} ] 3. Expanding the numerator: [ (a+k)b - a(b+k) = ab + kb - ab - ak = bk - ak = (b-a)k ] 4. Therefore, the difference simplifies to: [ frac{a+k}{b+k} - frac{a}{b} = frac{(b-a)k}{b(b+k)} ] 5. Now we analyze the behavior of this expression based on the relationship between ( a ) and ( b ): - If ( frac{a}{b} < 1 ) (which means ( a < b )), then ( b - a > 0 ). Therefore, ( frac{(b-a)k}{b(b+k)} > 0 ), which implies: [ frac{a+k}{b+k} > frac{a}{b} ] Hence, the fraction increases. - If ( frac{a}{b} > 1 ) (which means ( a > b )), then ( b - a < 0 ). Therefore, ( frac{(b-a)k}{b(b+k)} < 0 ), which implies: [ frac{a+k}{b+k} < frac{a}{b} ] Hence, the fraction decreases. 6. Next, we consider what happens as ( k ) grows indefinitely: [ frac{a+k}{b+k} = frac{frac{a}{k} + 1}{frac{b}{k} + 1} ] As ( k to infty ), both ( frac{a}{k} ) and ( frac{b}{k} ) approach 0. So the fraction simplifies to: [ frac{frac{a}{k} + 1}{frac{b}{k} + 1} to frac{0+1}{0+1} = 1 ] 7. Therefore: - If ( frac{a}{b} < 1 ), then ( frac{a+k}{b+k} ) increases towards 1 (approaches 1 from below). - If ( frac{a}{b} > 1 ), then ( frac{a+k}{b+k} ) decreases towards 1 (approaches 1 from above). # Conclusion: If the original fraction ( frac{a}{b} < 1 ), then ( frac{a+k}{b+k} ) increases.

This is because it's possible for planes alpha and beta to intersect elsewhere. The only requirement for m parallel beta is that the line of intersection between alpha and beta, if it exists, is parallel to m. - This shows that \\"m parallel beta\\" does not necessarily lead to \\"alpha parallel beta\\".

This is because alpha and beta being parallel means they do not intersect, and thus, no line in alpha can intersect with beta. - This logically implies that if \\"alpha parallel beta\\", then any line m within alpha must also be parallel to beta (m parallel beta).

Thus, we can express V as: [ V = k cdot m + d, ] where d is the remainder which satisfies 0 leq d < m. 2. Fedya can choose m geq 2. Note that the response to Fedya's question only gives k, not d. Therefore, there could be multiple possible values for V even with k known, depending on d. 3. For example, let V = k cdot m + d be such that m=2. Fedya asks, \\"What is the integer part of the division of your number by 2?\\" Vasya responds with k. Consequently, there are two potential scenarios for Vasya's number: - V = 2k - V = 2k + 1 4. Therefore, to definitively determine Vasya's number, Fedya requires further information. A second question provides the necessary detail. The second question should incorporate the possible values derived from the first response. 5. Let Fedya select m = 2. Vasya's responses to the first question provide: - If Vasya's number is V, then V = 2k or V = 2k + 1 depending on whether V is even or odd. 6. Fedya then asks the next question, \\"What is the integer part of the division of your number by 2k + 1?\\": - If V = 2k, then upon dividing by (2k + 1), the quotient will be 0. - If V = 2k + 1, then upon dividing by (2k + 1), the quotient will be 1.

This is because angle MBO = angle MOB, indicating that triangle MBO is isosceles with MO and MB as its equal sides. Similarly, by applying the same logic to the other side of the triangle, we find that NO = NC. 4. **Calculating the Perimeter of triangle AMN**: To find the perimeter of triangle AMN, we add the lengths of its sides: begin{align*} AM + MN + NA &= AM + MO + NO + NA &= AM + MB + NC + NA &= AB + AC end{align*} Here, we used the fact that MO = MB and NO = NC to substitute MO + NO with MB + NC. Additionally, AM + MB = AB and NA + NC = AC by segment addition. 5. **Substitute Given Values**: Given that AB = 12 and AC = 18, we substitute these values into our equation: begin{align*} AB + AC &= 12 + 18 &= 30 end{align*} Therefore, the perimeter of triangle AMN is boxed{30}, which corresponds to choice textbf{(B)} 30."},{"instruction":"a chess tournament, a team of schoolchildren and a team of students, each consisting of 15 participants, compete against each other. During the tournament, each schoolchild must play with each student exactly once, with the condition that everyone can play at most once per day. Different numbers of games could be played on different days. At some point in the tournament, the organizer noticed that there is exactly one way to schedule the next day with 15 games and N ways to schedule the next day with just 1 game (the order of games in the schedule does not matter, only who plays with whom matters). Find the maximum possible value of N.","output":"1. In the chess tournament setup, we have two teams: one of school students and one of college students, each consisting of 15 members. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of ( N ), which represents the total number of games left to be played in the tournament. 2. Notice that: - Each player from the school team must play exactly one game with each player from the student team. - Each player can only play one game per day. 3. Considering every student must play with every member of the other team exactly once, the maximum number of games is computed using the formula for combinations where each student plays against every other opponent: [ text{Total games} = 15 times 15 = 225 ] 4. Let’s establish that there’s no alternative way to schedule 15 games other than with unique pairs where the kth school student plays with the mth college student (this ensures that schedules are unique and non-conflicting). 5. We need an example to demonstrate when ( N = 120 ): - Number the school students and college students from 1 to 15. - Suppose that a school student with number ( k ) must play with all college students numbered 1 to ( k ). 6. The number of remaining games can be calculated using the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 15 ] Use the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers: [ sum_{k=1}^{15} k = frac{15 times (15 + 1)}{2} = 120 ] This confirms that there are 120 games left to play. 7. Next, we prove that ( N leq 120 ): - Assume that the only way to play 15 games in a single day is when each kth school student plays with the kth college student, resulting in 15 pairs. - Let’s call these pairs direct, whereas pairs with different indexes are called cross pairs. 8. We must ensure no situation arises where ( k )-th school student has to play with the ( m )-th college student, and vice-versa (if so, multiple ways to schedule 15 games would violate our conditions). 9. Therefore, the planned cross games for each pair must not exceed: [ frac{15 times 14}{2} = 105 ] Adding the approved 15 direct games: [ 105 + 15 = 120 ] So, the total number of games left is at maximum 120. # Conclusion: [ boxed{120} ]"},{"instruction":"f everyone works at the same efficiency, and a people can make c parts in b days, then the number of days required for b people to make a parts is ( ) A: frac{c}{a^2} B: frac{a^2}{c} C: frac{c^2}{a} D: frac{a}{c^2}","output":"Since 1 person can make frac{c}{ab} parts in 1 day, the number of days required for b people to make a parts is: frac{a}{b cdot frac{c}{ab}} = frac{a^2}{c}.

The largest possible sum of (a) and (b) without exceeding 147 is: [ 79 + 69 = 148 ] Since the sum of (a) and (b) must be 147, this means we need to adjust these values slightly: [ 147 = 78 + 69 quad text{or} quad 147 = 79 + 68 ] 5.

We need to find the area of the triangle formed by the intersection of the bisector plane of this dihedral angle with the tetrahedron. 2. To begin, let's recall a key geometric theorem for tetrahedrons: For a tetrahedron with volume (V), the dihedral angle (phi) between two adjacent faces with areas (S_1) and (S_2), and an edge of length (a) shared between these faces, is given by: [ V = frac{2}{3} cdot frac{S_1 S_2 sin phi}{a} ] 3.

According to the ‘three perpendiculars theorem’, if (H) is the foot of the perpendicular from (D) onto the plane (ABC), then the perpendicular from (H) to (AB) implies (D K perp AB).

This proves our initial theorem. To solve the actual problem, consider the bisector plane of the angle (alpha).

Draw the line CH intersecting DE at M. Since H is the orthocenter, we know that CH perp DE. 6. Consider triangles triangle AEF, triangle BFD, and triangle CDE. Reflect them along their respective midlines EF, FD, and DE, such that the vertices A, B, and C coincide at a point S^{prime}, forming a solid S^{prime}-DEF. Refer to figure 17-12 for a visualization. 7. Since S^{prime}M perp DE and HM perp DE, it follows that DE perp plane S^{prime}MH. 8. Thus, we have that S^{prime}H perp DE. Similarly, we can show that S^{prime}H perp DF, so S^{prime}H perp plane DEF. 9. Consequently, S^{prime} is the apex of a circular cone, with odot H being the base circle of the cone. 10.

We denote by ( E(H) ) the set of lines determined by all distinct pairs of points in ( H ). 3. **Central Symmetry**: Consider a point set ( H ) that is centrally symmetric with respect to a center ( C ). For any line ( e ) in ( E(H) ) that does not pass through ( C ), there exists another line in ( E(H) ) that is parallel to ( e ), and not identical to it (specifically, the reflection of ( e ) with respect to ( C ) which is also in ( E(H) )). 4. **Addressing Lines Through Center**: The lines passing through ( C ) might still cause issues. To address this, we take an arbitrary point ( P ) in ( H ) distinct from ( C ) and reflect ( H ) over ( P ) to create a new set ( H^* ). 5. **Combining Sets ( H ) and ( H^* )**: Let's create the set ( H_P = H cup H^* ). In this new set, lines passing through ( P ) no longer pose a problem as explained next: 6. **Verification of Parallel Lines**: - Take any point ( Q ) from ( H ) that does not lie on line ( PC ). We know there exists a line in ( E(H) ) parallel and distinct from line ( PQ ) which intersects the reflection points of ( P ) and ( Q ) from ( H ). - Similarly, if ( Q ) is taken from ( H^* ), line ( PQ ) is parallel to a distinct line in ( E(H^*) ). - For the line ( PC ), consider a point ( Q ) not on ( PC ) in ( H ). Taking its reflection point ( Q_1 ) respective to ( C ) and ( Q^* ) respect to ( P ), line ( Q_1Q^* ) is parallel and distinct from line ( PC ). Hence, the combined set ( H_P ) ensures that for any two distinct points ( A ) and ( B ) in the set, a pair of distinct points ( C ) and ( D ) can be found such that lines ( AB ) and ( CD ) are parallel and distinct. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the answer to the problem is affirmative. Such a set ( M ) indeed exists. For example, we can start with any centrally symmetric point set ( H ) not lying in a single plane, reflect it over one of its points distinct from the center, and take the union of the original and its reflection. This union set ( H_P ) satisfies the required property.

In each step, each number x is paired with another number y, and they are replaced by their sum (x+y) and their difference (x-y). Mathematically, we express this as follows: [ (x+y)^{2} + (x-y)^{2} = 2(x^{2} + y^{2}). ] 2. This equation shows that the sum of the squares of any pair (x,y) after the transformation remains proportional to their original sum of squares, specifically increasing by a factor of 2. 3. Next, evaluate the sum of squares of eight consecutive integers (n-3, n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4). This is given by: [ (n-3)^2 + (n-2)^2 + (n-1)^2 + n^2 + (n+1)^2 + (n+2)^2 + (n+3)^2 + (n+4)^2. ] 4. Expanding and simplifying the quadratic terms, we get: [ (n-3)^2 = n^2 - 6n + 9, ] [ (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4, ] [ (n-1)^2 = n^2 - 2n + 1, ] [ n^2 = n^2, ] [ (n+1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1, ] [ (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4, ] [ (n+3)^2 = n^2 + 6n + 9, ] [ (n+4)^2 = n^2 + 8n + 16. ] 5. Summing these expanded terms yields: [ (n^2 - 6n + 9) + (n^2 - 4n + 4) + (n^2 - 2n + 1) + n^2 + (n^2 + 2n + 1) + (n^2 + 4n + 4) + (n^2 + 6n + 9) + (n^2 + 8n + 16). ] 6. Collecting like terms, we get: [ 8n^2 + (8n - 8n) + (9 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 16). ] 7. Simplifying further, we obtain: [ 8n^2 + 4. ] 8. Therefore, the sum of squares of these eight consecutive integers modulo 8 results in: [ 8n^2 + 4 equiv 4 pmod{8}. ] 9. It follows that, starting with 1000 consecutive integers, the sum of the squares of these integers is congruent to 4 modulo 8 before any transformation step. 10. After the first transformation step, since each pairing and replacement respects the property that the sum of squares scales by a factor of 2, the updated sum of squares will be: [ 2 times (1000 text{ consecutive integers})^2 = (some large number). ] 11. This new sum will be a multiple of 8 because it involves doubling the original sum of squares. Specifically, if the initial sum of squares was congruent to 4 modulo 8, after transformation, it will now be congruent to: [ 2 times 4 equiv 0 pmod{8}. ] 12. Given the sum of squares is now a multiple of 8 and no longer congruent to 4 modulo 8, it is impossible for the numbers to still constitute 1000 consecutive integers again. Therefore, this proves that the blackboard will not contain 1000 consecutive integers again after the sequence of transformations. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Points ( A, B, C ), and ( D ) are located on a line such that ( AB = BC = CD ).

We start by considering the polynomial ( P(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e ) with real coefficients that satisfies ( 0 leq P(x) leq 1 ) for ( -1 leq x leq 1 ). 2.

For any ( x_1 in [-1, 1] ), we have: [ 0 leq P(x_1) = P_1(x_1) + P_2(x_1) ] and [ 0 leq P(-x_1) = P_1(x_1) - P_2(x_1) ] 4.

To complete the entire work (which is 1 unit of work), we can calculate the number of days as follows: Days for B to complete the work = 1 / (B's work rate) Days for B to complete the work = 1 / (1/24) Days for B to complete the work = 24 Therefore, B alone will complete the work in boxed{24} days."},{"instruction":"a village in Sri Lanka, a certain percentage of people died by bombardment, 20% of the remainder left the village on account of fear.

Each square on the board contains a distinct integer from the set {1, 2, 3, ldots, n^2}. 2. Define any square to be “row-excellent” if the number in that square is greater than the numbers in at least 2004 other squares within the same row. 3. Since there are exactly n integers placed in each row of the chessboard, and each integer is unique, at least n - 2004 squares in any row must contain numbers that are greater than the numbers in at least 2004 other squares within that row. 4. Therefore, each row on the n times n chessboard contains exactly n - 2004 row-excellent squares. Consequently, the chessboard in total has n times (n - 2004) = n^2 - 2004n row-excellent squares. 5. In a similar manner, define any square to be “column-excellent” if the number in that square is greater than the numbers in at least 2004 other squares within the same column. 6. As determined for rows, the same argument holds for columns: each column will also have n - 2004 column-excellent squares. 7. Any square classified as an “excellent square” must satisfy both the row-excellent and column-excellent conditions simultaneously. 8. To determine if a square is excellent, consider the approach of marking specific squares. For each i from 1 to n, fill the ith row with numbers such that the first 2004 positions (modulo n) are marked “*”. This ensures that each row and each column has exactly 2004 marked “*” positions. - When 1 leq i leq 2003, the squares of the ith column in rows 1, 2, ldots, i, n+i-2003, n+i-2002, ldots, n are filled with “*”. - For i geq 2004, the ith column in rows i-2003, i-2002, ldots, i are filled with “*”. 9. Any square without a “*” is filled by numbers that do not count as “*” marks. Since each “*” marks the smallest 2004 numbers in its row or column, the unmarked squares must be greater than the numbers in the marked squares. Hence, all unmarked squares are guaranteed to be greater than at least 2004 other numbers in their respective rows and columns. 10. Therefore, each unmarked square is an excellent square, and since there are n^2 - 2004n such squares, the maximum number of excellent squares on the n times n chessboard is n(n - 2004).

We know the number of girls in each row, column, and along each line parallel to the diagonals. For which values of (n) is this information sufficient to determine the exact positions of the girls in the grid? For which positions can we definitively state whether there is a girl there?","output":"To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the provided information and applying it to different values of ( n ). 1. **Understanding the problem**: - We are given an ( n times n ) grid composed of boys and girls. - Each row, column, and diagonal line contains a known number of girls. - The task is to determine for which values of ( n ) these pieces of information are sufficient to determine the positions of the girls in the grid. 2. **Cases for small values of ( n )**: - For ( n = 1 ), ( n = 2 ), and ( n = 3 ): - Clearly, for these small grids, the given number of girls in rows, columns, and diagonals is sufficient to uniquely determine the positions of the girls. Thus, the information is enough. - ( n = 1 ): There is only 1 cell. If the number of girls is known, one can determine if the cell is occupied by a girl. - ( n = 2 ): Two rows, two columns, and diagonals with known counts make it straightforward to determine the positions via simple deduction and exclusion. - ( n = 3 ): Nine cells can be determined by analyzing the sums given for each line. 3. **Case for ( n = 4 ) and larger**: - When ( n = 4 ): - We need to consider the ( 4 times 4 ) grid: - Information about the number of girls in the rows, columns, and diagonals might not always be enough to uniquely determine the positions of all the girls. - Consider an example: - If the four corners of the grid (positions (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), and (4,4)) are known to have specific values, this gives some information. - Further, the middle positions form a smaller 2x2 grid. If the sums for rows and columns are given, one can solve equations to find counts in these positions. 4. **Detailed mathematical derivation**: For ( n = 5 ) - We create a ( 5 times 5 ) grid and denote the number of girls at position ((i,j)) as ( a_{ij} ). - Let's consider the sums of specific lines (rows, columns, and diagonals): - Given: [ sum_{j=1}^{5} a_{ij} quad text{(sums for rows)} ] [ sum_{i=1}^{5} a_{ij} quad text{(sums for columns)} ] [ sum_{i=1}^{5} a_{ii}, quad sum_{i=1}^{5} a_{i,6-i} quad text{(sums for main diagonals)} ] - Utilizing given conditions: [ 3 cdot a_{33} = sum_{j=1}^{5} a_{ij} - sum_{j neq 3} sum_{i=1}^{5} a_{ij} + (a_{41} + a_{52}) + (a_{14} + a_{25}) + (a_{12} + a_{21}) + (a_{45} + a_{54}) + sum_{i=1}^{5} a_{ii} + sum_{i neq j=6} a_{ij} ] - Each sum or term within parentheses is pre-determined as valid or known. Therefore, ( a_{33} ) is solvable. - But for other placements, just like in a ( 4 times 4 ) grid, additional complexities and possibilities arise making certain positions indeterminable without further unique constraints. - Inferring from 5 case and results seen at ( 4 times 4 ), it is insufficient for ( n geq 6 ). 5. **General case for ( n geq 6 )**: - In an ( n times n ) matrix, if ( n geq 6 ): - Only the positions of the four corners might be determinable due to similar grid extrapolation from case ( n = 5 ). - Section of large grids ensues issues since new ( 5 times 5 ) form might present more undeterminable cells akin to smaller griddens ( 4 times 4 ). **Conclusion:** The information given is sufficient to determine the positions of the girls for ( n = 1, 2, 3 ). For ( n = 4 ), not all positions can always be determined. For ( n = 5 ), most positions cannot be determined. For ( n geq 6 ), generally, the positions cannot be concretely determined except for a few specific locations adhering to the grid confines explained.

Given that PF_1 perp PF_2, the area of triangle PF_1F_2 is 1, so frac{1}{2}mn = 1, which gives mn = 2.

Moving along a broken line, he runs for 30 kilometers. Prove that the sum of all the angles at which the lion turned is not less than 2998 radians. 1. **Understanding the Scenario**: - The arena is a circle with a radius of (10) meters. - The lion runs a total distance of (30) kilometers, which is (30,000) meters. - The path of the lion is along a broken line (which means it has multiple segments and thus multiple turns). 2. **Path Length and Turning Angles**: - The total angle turned by the lion can be studied using the concept of external angles in polygonal paths. - Each turn the lion makes contributes to the sum of the external angles. 3. **Polygonal Path Review**: - In a two-dimensional planar polygon, the sum of the external angles is (2pi) radians. - If the path were closed, the sum of the external turning angles for a simple polygonal path is (2pi). 4. **Distance and Angular Changes**: - Since the lion runs (30,000) meters in a circle of radius (10) meters, it is equivalent to running around the circumference of several circles.

Since Machine Q produces 10% more sprockets per hour than Machine A, Machine Q produces A + 0.1A = 1.1A sprockets per hour. Let's denote the time it takes for Machine Q to produce 880 sprockets as T hours. Therefore, Machine P takes T + 10 hours to produce the same number of sprockets. Since Machine Q produces 880 sprockets in T hours, we can write the following equation for Machine Q: 880 = 1.1A * T (1) Since Machine P takes 10 hours longer to produce the same number of sprockets, we can write the following equation for Machine P: 880 = A * (T + 10) (2) Now we have two equations with two unknowns (A and T). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of A. From equation (1), we can express T in terms of A: T = 880 / (1.1A) Substitute T in equation (2) with the expression from above: 880 = A * (880 / (1.1A) + 10) Now, let's solve for A: 880 = A * (800 / A + 10) 880 = 800 + 10A 10A = 880 - 800 10A = 80 A = 80 / 10 A = 8 Machine A produces boxed{8} sprockets per hour."},{"instruction":"A boy takes 60 seconds to run round a square field of a certain side length, if he runs at the rate of 12 km/hr.

This approach is suitable because the expression involves squared terms and no reciprocals or products. 1. **Applying the QM-AM Inequality**: The QM-AM inequality states that for any set of real numbers, the quadratic mean is always greater than or equal to the arithmetic mean. Applying this to the numbers a+b, b-c, and c-a, we get: sqrt{frac{(a+b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2}{3}} ge frac{(a+b)+(b-c)+(c-a)}{3}. 2. **Simplifying the Right-Hand Side**: Simplifying the arithmetic mean of a+b, b-c, and c-a gives us: frac{(a+b)+(b-c)+(c-a)}{3} = frac{2b}{3}. 3. **Squaring Both Sides**: To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the inequality: frac{(a+b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2}{3} ge frac{4b^2}{9}. 4. **Manipulating the Inequality**: To make the inequality resemble the given expression, we divide both sides by b^2 and multiply both sides by 3: frac{(a+b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2}{b^2} ge frac{4}{3}. 5. **Finding Equality**: To achieve equality, we need a+b=b-c=c-a.

Using the original equation with n = k: f(f(k)) + f(k) = 2k + 3 f(k+1) + (k+1) = 2k + 3 f(k+1) = 2k + 3 - (k+1) f(k+1) = k + 2 This matches our assumption that f(n) = n + 1. Therefore, by induction, f(n) = n + 1 for all non-negative integers n. Now, to find f(2017), we simply apply our function: f(2017) = 2017 + 1 f(2017) = 2018 So, the value of f(2017) is boxed{2018} ."},{"instruction":"Let P be a polynomial with integer coefficients.

Let ( P(x) ) be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Given that ( P(n^2) = 2022 ) for some positive integer ( n ), we can express ( P(x) ) in the form: [ P(x) = (x - n^2)Q(x) + 2022 ] where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. 2. Suppose there exists a positive rational number ( r = frac{p}{q} ) (in lowest terms, i.e., (gcd(p, q) = 1)) such that ( P(r^2) = 2024 ). Then we have: [ Pleft(left(frac{p}{q}right)^2right) = 2024 ] Substituting ( x = left(frac{p}{q}right)^2 ) into the polynomial expression, we get: [ Pleft(frac{p^2}{q^2}right) = left(frac{p^2}{q^2} - n^2right)Qleft(frac{p^2}{q^2}right) + 2022 = 2024 ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ left(frac{p^2 - q^2 n^2}{q^2}right)Qleft(frac{p^2}{q^2}right) + 2022 = 2024 ] [ left(frac{p^2 - q^2 n^2}{q^2}right)Qleft(frac{p^2}{q^2}right) = 2 ] 3. Since ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, ( Qleft(frac{p^2}{q^2}right) ) must be a rational number. Let ( Qleft(frac{p^2}{q^2}right) = frac{A}{B} ) where ( A ) and ( B ) are integers and (gcd(A, B) = 1). Then: [ left(frac{p^2 - q^2 n^2}{q^2}right) cdot frac{A}{B} = 2 ] [ frac{(p^2 - q^2 n^2)A}{q^2 B} = 2 ] [ (p^2 - q^2 n^2)A = 2q^2 B ] 4. Since ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime, ( p^2 - q^2 n^2 ) must be an integer. For the equation ( (p^2 - q^2 n^2)A = 2q^2 B ) to hold, ( p^2 - q^2 n^2 ) must divide ( 2q^2 B ). However, since ( p^2 - q^2 n^2 ) is an integer and ( q^2 ) is a perfect square, ( p^2 - q^2 n^2 ) must divide 2. 5. The only integers that divide 2 are ( pm 1 ) and ( pm 2 ). However, ( p^2 ) and ( q^2 n^2 ) are both perfect squares, and the difference between two perfect squares cannot be 1 or 2 (since the difference between two perfect squares is always at least 3 for positive integers). 6. Therefore, it is impossible for ( p^2 - q^2 n^2 ) to be ( pm 1 ) or ( pm 2 ). This contradiction implies that there cannot be a positive rational number ( r ) such that ( P(r^2) = 2024 ).

Therefore, line (YM) is the perpendicular bisector of [AD]. - Since C and Y both lie on the angle bisector (CF) of angle ACD, CY is also the perpendicular bisector of the segment [AD]. 3. **Application of South Pole Theorem:** - According to the South Pole Theorem, when a line (in this case (CY)) is the angle bisector and also the perpendicular bisector of a segment joining to vertices of a triangle ([AD]), it implies that the points A, Y, D, and C are concyclic (lie on a common circle). 4. **Calculation of Angles:** - Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we know that opposite angles sum up to 180^circ. Therefore: [ widehat{AYC} + widehat{ADC} = 180^circ ] - Similarly, considering the cyclic nature from the previous reasoning: [ widehat{AXB} + widehat{ADB} = 180^circ ] - Since AD is a common chord, we combine both results: [ widehat{AYC} + widehat{AXB} = widehat{ADC} + widehat{ADB} = 180^circ ] 5. **Conclusion:** - The above arguments show that the four points A, X, Y, and I lie on the same circle, proving that the quadrilateral ( AXYI ) is cyclic.

According to the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least three segments among these five that are the same color. Let’s assume without loss of generality that this common color is blue.

Hence, x_{1}+x_{2}=4k and x_{1}x_{2}=-4; therefore, |AB|=sqrt{1+k^{2}}|x_{1}-x_{2}|=sqrt{1+k^{2}} sqrt{16k^{2}+16}=4(1+k^{2}). From x^{2}=4y, we get y=frac{x^{2}}{4}, hence y'=frac{x}{2}. The slope of the tangent at point A is then frac{x_{1}}{2}, and the tangent line is y-y_{1}=frac{x_{1}}{2}(x-x_{1}). Setting y=0, we find the point Mleft(frac{x_{1}}{2},0right). Therefore, the distance d from point M to line AB is d=frac{left|kcdot frac{x_{1}}{2}+1right|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}}, and the area S_{triangle ABM} is S_{triangle ABM}=frac{1}{2}times 4(1+k^{2}) times frac{left|kcdot frac{x_{1}}{2}+1right|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}}=sqrt{1+k^{2}} left|kx_{1}+2right|. Substituting k=frac{y_{1}-1}{x_{1}}=frac{x_{1}^{2}-4}{4x_{1}} into the above expression and simplifying, we obtain: S_{triangle ABM}= frac{1}{16} frac{(x_{1}^{2}+4)^{2}}{|x_{1}|}. Let f(x)=frac{(x^{2}+4)^{2}}{|x|}, then f(x) is an even function. When x>0, f(x)=frac{(x^{2}+4)^{2}}{x}=x^{3}+8x+frac{16}{x}, and f'(x)=3x^{2}+8-frac{16}{x^{2}}=frac{(x^{2}+4)(3x^{2}-4)}{x^{2}}.

Since the total weight of the peanut butter is 20 ounces and she used 4 ounces of oil, we can subtract the weight of the oil from the total weight to find the weight of the peanuts: 20 ounces (total weight) - 4 ounces (oil) = 16 ounces (peanuts) Now, we know that she used 16 ounces of peanuts with 4 ounces of oil. To find out how many ounces of peanuts she uses for every two ounces of oil, we can set up a proportion: 4 ounces of oil : 16 ounces of peanuts 2 ounces of oil : x ounces of peanuts We can solve for x by cross-multiplying: 4 * x = 2 * 16 4x = 32 x = 32 / 4 x = 8 So, Sonja uses boxed{8} ounces of peanuts for every two ounces of oil."},{"instruction":"The number of positive integers less than 500 divisible by neither 5 nor 7 is: A) 330 B) 340 C) 343 D) 350 E) 360","output":"1. **Count the integers divisible by 5:** The number of positive integers less than 500 divisible by 5 is calculated as: [ leftlfloor frac{499}{5} rightrfloor = 99 ] 2. **Count the integers divisible by 7:** The number of positive integers less than 500 divisible by 7 is: [ leftlfloor frac{499}{7} rightrfloor = 71 ] 3. **Count the integers divisible by both 5 and 7 (i.e., 35):** The count of numbers divisible by 35 is: [ leftlfloor frac{499}{35} rightrfloor = 14 ] 4. **Apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** To find the number of integers divisible by either 5 or 7, we add the counts from steps 1 and 2, then subtract the count from step 3 to avoid double-counting: [ 99 + 71 - 14 = 156 ] 5. **Calculate the number of integers divisible by neither 5 nor 7:** The total number of positive integers less than 500 is 499.

Case A: King in a Corner 1. There are 4 corners on the chessboard. 2. If the king is in a corner, it occupies one of those 4 positions. 3. The rook cannot be placed in the same row or column as the king, and it also must avoid the square diagonally adjacent to the king. 4. Therefore, the rook is restricted from 2 row positions, 2 column positions, and 1 diagonal position, equating to 5 restricted squares. 5. Since the chessboard has a total of 64 squares, the rook can be placed in 64 - 5 = 59 positions. 6. Therefore, for each corner position of the king, there are: [ 59 text{ positions for the rook} ] So, for all 4 corners: [ 4 times 59 = 236 text{ possibilities} ] Case B: King on the Edge but not in a Corner 1. There are 8 (rows) times 2 = 16 edge squares, minus the 4 corners already considered, giving 12 positions. 2. If the king is on an edge but not in a corner, it essentially restricts an entire row and column, and two diagonal squares. 3. Hence, it restricts 8 (row) + 7 (column) + 2 (diagonal) - 1 (text{overlap count}) = 16 positions. 4. Thus, the rook can occupy 64 - 16 = 48 positions. 5. For each of these 12 positions, there are: [ 48 text{ positions for the rook} ] So, combining these: [ 12 times 48 = 576 text{ possibilities} ] Case C: King in the Center (non-edge) 1. There are 36 center positions (since it avoids the first and last rows and columns). 2. If the king is placed in any of these central positions, it restricts one row, one column, and 4 diagonal positions initially. 3. This restriction equals 8 (row) + 7 (column) + 4 (diagonal) - 1 (text{overlap count}) = 18 positions. 4. Therefore, the rook can occupy 64 - 18 = 46 positions. 5. For each center position, there are: [ 46 text{ positions for the rook} ] So, combining these: [ 36 times 46 = 1656 text{ possibilities} ] Conclusion Summing up all cases: [ boxed{236 + 576 + 1656 = 2468} ]"},{"instruction":"The acute angle of the rhombus at the base of a quadrilateral pyramid is alpha.

Let ( EO ) be the height of the pyramid and ( EF ) be the height of the side face ( CED ). 3. Since all faces of the pyramid are inclined equally to the base, point ( O ) is the center of the inscribed circle of the rhombus ( ABCD ) and also the intersection of the diagonals of the rhombus. This implies that ( O ) is the centroid of the base. 4. Let ( alpha ) be the acute angle of the rhombus ( ABCD ). 5. Denote the side length of the rhombus ( ABCD ) as ( a ). Then, the area ( S_{text{base}} ) of the base can be calculated as: [ S_{text{base}} = a^2 sin alpha ] 6. The total surface area of the pyramid, ( S ), consists of the base area plus the lateral surface area. Given that all the lateral faces are congruent, the area of each lateral face is: [ S_{sigma} = frac{S_{text{base}}}{cos beta} ] where ( beta ) is the angle of inclination of a lateral face to the base. 7. Since the top of each lateral face contributes equally, the lateral surface area is: [ S_{text{lateral}} = 4 cdot frac{S_{text{base}}}{cos beta} ] 8. The total surface area then is: [ S = S_{text{base}} + S_{text{lateral}} = a^2 sin alpha + 4 left(frac{a^2 sin alpha}{cos beta}right) ] 9. We are given that the ratio of the total surface area to the square of the side of the base is ( k ), so: [ k = frac{S}{a^2} ] Substituting ( S ) from the above: [ k = frac{a^2 sin alpha + 4 left(frac{a^2 sin alpha}{cos beta}right)}{a^2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ k = sin alpha + frac{4 sin alpha}{cos beta} ] 10.

Solving for ( cos beta ), we obtain: [ cos beta = frac{sin alpha}{k - 4 sin alpha} ] 12. The sine of the angle between the apothem and the height of the pyramid is given by: [ sin angle OEF = cos angle EFO = frac{sin alpha}{k - 4 sin alpha} ] 13.

Let ( x ) and ( y ) be the number of candies in two different boxes: [ x equiv a pmod{5} ] [ y equiv b pmod{5} ] The possible changes after one operation are: [ x rightarrow x - 4 equiv a - 4 pmod{5} ] [ y rightarrow y + 1 equiv b + 1 pmod{5} ] For any pair of boxes, the difference ( x - y equiv a - b pmod{5} ) remains constant or changes by multiples of 5: [ (x+1)-(y+1) = x-y ] [ (x-4)-(y+1) = x-y-5 ] [ (x+1)-(y-4) = x-y+5 ] 4. **Conclusion from the Invariance:** Since the residues mod 5 remain distinct and non-zero for at least the first four boxes, it ensures at least one box must reach a residue of 0 when others span 1 to 4. 5. **Calculate the maximum sum:** To find the maximum number of candies the sweet tooth can take, they must take all candies from one box while ensuring the process leaves at least 6 candies distributed in the other four boxes initially as 0, 1, 2, and 3 modulo 5 sums: [ sum_{i=0}^{4} i = 10 pmod{5}, text{ thus at least 6 candies always left in the boxes} ] Calculating the maximum number: begin{align*} text{Total Sum} &= 11 + 22 + 33 + 44 + 55 &= 165 - 6 = 159 end{align*} 6. **Verification by Example:** The sweet tooth could iteratively transfer 4 candies among boxes until only possible non-divisible number differences arise, leading to one residue being 0 leaving ( 159 ).

This triangle has sides that correspond to the differences in lengths of opposite sides of the hexagon. 4. **Calculate Areas with Symmetry**: - Each triangle (A_1A_3A_5) and (A_2A_4A_6) cuts through the central triangle (T), dividing the remaining area into symmetrical sections of the parallelograms. - Both triangles (A_1A_3A_5) and (A_2A_4A_6) incidentally enclose the same proportionally divided sections of these parallelograms plus half of the area of the central triangle (T). 5. **Area Summation**: - Let (s_{text{hex}}) denote the total area of the hexagon. - Let (s_{text{paral}}) denote the combined area of the three parallelograms. - Consequently, the area of the entire hexagon is the sum of the areas of the three parallelograms and the central triangle (T): [ s_{text{hex}} = s_{text{paral}} + s_T. ] 6. **Divide and Calculate**: - The area of each triangle (either (A_1A_3A_5) or (A_2A_4A_6)) can thus be calculated as: [ text{Area of } triangle A_1A_3A_5 = frac{s_{text{hex}} + s_T}{2} ] - The same calculation applies to (triangle A_2A_4A_6): [ text{Area of } triangle A_2A_4A_6 = frac{s_{text{hex}} + s_T}{2} ] Thus, we can conclude that the areas of the triangles (A_1A_3A_5) and (A_2A_4A_6) are indeed equal, which completes our proof.

Then langle f(vec{a}), f(vec{u}) rangle = langle f(vec{b}), f(vec{u}) rangle for all vec{u} in mathbb{F}_p^k.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of faster train + Speed of slower train Relative speed = ( 48 ) km/h + ( 24 ) km/h Relative speed = ( 72 ) km/h To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor ( 1 ) km/h = ( frac{1}{3.6} ) m/s: Relative speed = ( 72 ) km/h * ( frac{1}{3.6} ) m/s/km/h Relative speed = ( 20 ) m/s The total distance to be covered when the trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is ( 100 ) m + ( 100 ) m = ( 200 ) m. The time ( t ) it takes for the trains to cross each other can be found using the formula: ( t = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Relative speed}} ) ( t = frac{200 text{ m}}{20 text{ m/s}} ) ( t = 10 ) seconds So, it takes boxed{10} seconds for the trains to cross each other."},{"instruction":"Prove that there is no fractionallinear function which, when added to its inverse function, gives 2 at every point where both functions are defined.

[       f(3) = 4 cdot 3 - 3^2 = 12 - 9 = 3.       ]     - If ( x_0 = 3 ), then every element in the sequence is 3: ( x_n = 3 ) for all ( n ). 3. **Investigating Further Values**:     - We need to find an infinite sequence ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots ) where ( a_0 = 3 ) and, for ( m geq 1 ), ( f(a_m) = a_{m-1} ). This leads to:       [       x_0 = a_m, quad x_1 = f(a_m) = a_{m-1}, quad x_2 = f(a_{m-1}) = a_{m-2}, ldots, x_m = a_0 = 3.       ]     - After this point, all subsequent elements will be 3, i.e., ( x_{m+1} = x_{m+2} = ldots = 3 ).     - Thus, the sequence will have at most ( m + 1 ) different elements. 4. **Solving the Recursive Equation**:     - Define the series ( a_0 = 3 ), and for ( m geq 1 ),        [       f(a_m) = a_{m-1}.       ]     - This implies ( a_m ) is a root of the quadratic equation ( x^2 - 4x + a_{m-1} = 0 ).

Since c^2 > 0 for any c neq 0, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by the positive quantity frac{1}{c^2} (which preserves the direction of the inequality because multiplying by a positive number does not change the inequality's direction) to obtain: [ac^{2} cdot frac{1}{c^2} > bc^{2} cdot frac{1}{c^2}] which simplifies to: [a > b] Thus, statement A is correct. **Statement B:** To test statement B, consider counterexamples. Let's pick a=2, b=1, c=0, and d=-2. These values satisfy a > b and c > d. However, when we calculate a-c and b-d, we get a-c = 2-0 = 2 and b-d = 1-(-2) = 3.

Calculating the expressions given in statement C yields: [frac{b+c}{a+c} = frac{2+1}{1+1} = frac{3}{2}] and [frac{b}{a} = frac{2}{1} = 2] Since frac{3}{2} < 2, the statement that frac{b+c}{a+c} > frac{b}{a} does not hold in this case. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. **Statement D:** Given a > b > 0, we know ab > 0 because the product of two positive numbers is positive. This implies frac{1}{ab} > 0.

Let the vertices of one face of the octahedron be A, B, and C, and the vertices of the face directly opposite this face be D, E, and F. These faces are equilateral triangles. 2. **Identifying Key Lines and Planes:**     The cube can be inscribed such that the plane passing through triangle ABC meets the plane passing through triangle DEF at the midpoint O of the diagonal KL of the cube, where K and L are vertices of the cube.

How many planes or spheres equidistant from these 5 points exist?","output":"Given are 5 points in space that do not lie on the same plane or on the same sphere. We need to determine how many planes or spheres exist that are equidistant from these 5 points. Let's denote the points as A, B, C, D, and E. According to the problem statement, these points are not lying on the same plane or sphere. Therefore, we conclude the following: Since no four points lie on a single plane or on a single sphere, we can analyze different configurations where: 1. Four points lie on one side of the considered sphere or plane Sigma, and the fifth point lies on the other side. 2. Three points lie on one side of Sigma, and the remaining two points lie on the opposite side. # Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Four Points on One Side:**    - Suppose points A, B, C, and D lie on one side of the sphere (or plane) Sigma, and point E lies on the other side.    - Since points A, B, C, and D do not all lie on the same circle or line (hence not on a single sphere or plane), there is a unique sphere (or plane) S passing through these four points.    - If S is a sphere, then the equidistant sphere Sigma must be concentric with S and passing through the midpoint of the line segment ME, where M intersects the line OE (center of S).    - If S is a plane, Sigma must be parallel to S and pass through the midpoint of the perpendicular from E to S.    - Therefore, there exists a unique sphere or plane Sigma equidistant from points A, B, C, and D on one side and point E on the other. 2. **Three Points on One Side:**    - Now consider the scenario where points A, B, and C are on one side, and points D and E lie on the other side.    - Through points A, B, and C (if not collinear), there is a unique circle or line s.     - If s is a circle, the center O of Sigma must be equidistant from points A, B, and C. Point O must lie on the perpendicular bisector of each side of triangle ABC resulting from these points.    - The equidistant plane or sphere Sigma must go through all possible configurations where points A, B, and C lie on one side, and D and E lie on the other. 3. **Count of Unique Planes or Spheres:**    - Given that each of the 5 points can individually serve as the lone point opposite to the other four, there are 5 such planes or spheres.    - Similarly, there are ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ) ways to choose 2 points out of 5, where the remaining 3 points lie on the opposite side, leading to another 10 unique configurations. Combining these scenarios, we conclude: **Conclusion:** The total number of unique planes or spheres equidistant from the given 5 points is: [ 5 (one point on one side) + 10 (two points on one side) = 15 ] Thus, the total number of planes or spheres equidistant from the 5 points is: [ boxed{15} ]"},{"instruction":"Dan has two times as many stickers as Tom.

George has 5 times as many stickers as Dan, so George has 5 * 72 = 360 stickers. Now, let's find out how many stickers they will have in total after they distribute the pack of 100 stickers. First, we need to find out how many stickers they have in total before the distribution: Bob has 12 stickers. Tom has 36 stickers. Dan has 72 stickers. George has 360 stickers. Total stickers before distribution = 12 + 36 + 72 + 360 = 480 stickers. Now, they are going to add 100 stickers to this total and then distribute them equally among themselves. So the new total will be: 480 + 100 = 580 stickers. There are 4 people, so we divide the total number of stickers by 4 to find out how many stickers each person will get after distribution: 580 / 4 = 145 stickers per person. Since George will get an equal share of the stickers, he will have 145 stickers after the distribution. But we need to add this to the number of stickers he already has to find out how many stickers he will have in total.

The slope of the line connecting M and N is k, so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is -frac{1}{k}.

From the given information, we know that S_5 = frac{5(a_1 + a_5)}{2} = 15, from which we can find a_1 = 1. Then, since a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 5, we can find the common difference d = 1. Using the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence, we can deduce that a_n = n. Therefore, frac{1}{a_n a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{n(n+1)} = frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}. Using the \\"splitting-term method,\\" we can find the sum of the sequence left{ frac{1}{a_n a_{n+1}} right} for the first 2016 terms. Answer: Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence {a_n} be d. Given that a_5 = 5 and S_5 = 15, From S_5 = frac{5(a_1 + a_5)}{2} = 15, we solve for a_1 = 1. Then, a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 5, so d = 1. The arithmetic sequence {a_n} has a first term of 1 and a common difference of 1, so a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = n. Next, frac{1}{a_n a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{n(n+1)} = frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}. Thus, the sum S_{2016} of the sequence left{ frac{1}{a_n a_{n+1}} right} for the first 2016 terms is: S_{2016} = (1 - frac{1}{2}) + (frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3}) + ldots + (frac{1}{2016} - frac{1}{2017}) S_{2016} = 1 - frac{1}{2017} S_{2016} = frac{2016}{2017} Therefore, the sum of the first 2016 terms of the given sequence is boxed{frac{2016}{2017}}."},{"instruction":"A certain online store sells a type of children's toy.

Therefore, the maximum selling price is calculated as follows:    [    x leqslant 30 times (1 + 50%) = 45    ]    Hence, x leqslant 45. 2. **Calculating Daily Sales Volume:**    When the selling price is increased by 5 yuan, the daily sales volume decreases by 50 items. If the selling price is 35 yuan, 350 items are sold. Therefore, for a selling price of 45 yuan, the sales volume is calculated as:    [    350 - 50 times frac{45 - 35}{5} = 250 text{ items}    ]    This means at the highest price per item, the daily sales volume is 250 items. 3. **Function Expression for Profit w:**    The profit obtained per day, w, as a function of the selling price x, is derived from the given conditions:    [    w = (350 - frac{x - 35}{5} times 50) times (x - 30) = (-10x + 700) times (x - 30) = -10x^2 + 1000x - 21000    ]    Therefore, the function expression for the daily profit w in terms of the selling price x is:    [    w = -10x^2 + 1000x - 21000    ]  Part 2: Maximum Profit and Selling Price 1. **Rewriting the Profit Function:**    The profit function can be rewritten as:    [    w = -10x^2 + 1000x - 21000 = -10(x - 50)^2 + 4000    ]    This shows that the profit function is a parabola opening downwards, with its vertex representing the maximum profit. 2. **Determining the Maximum Profit:**    Since the parabola opens downwards (a = -10 < 0), and the axis of symmetry is at x = 50, but the selling price must be leqslant 45, the maximum profit occurs at the upper limit of x, which is 45 yuan. Calculating the maximum profit:    [    w_{max} = -10 times (45 - 50)^2 + 4000 = 3750    ] Therefore, the online store makes the maximum profit per day when the selling price is 45 yuan, and the maximum profit is boxed{3750 text{ yuan}}."},{"instruction":"Given that sin alpha > 0, cos alpha < 0, and sin frac{alpha}{3} > cos frac{alpha}{3}, determine the range of values for frac{alpha}{3}.

Now, consider the angle (frac{alpha}{3}): Since (alpha) is in the second quadrant (left(frac{pi}{2} < alpha < pi right)), dividing by 3, we get:    [    frac{pi}{6} < frac{alpha}{3} < frac{pi}{3}    ] 3.

This means that if a < b, then lg a < lg b for all a, b > 0. 2. **Given Inequality lg x < lg y**: Since lg x < lg y, and knowing that the logarithmic function is strictly increasing, we can directly infer that x < y. This step uses the property of the logarithmic function mentioned above. 3. **Analyzing the Reverse Implication**: Now, let's consider the reverse scenario where x < y. While it's tempting to immediately conclude that lg x < lg y, we must remember that the logarithmic function is defined only for positive real numbers. Therefore, without additional information about the signs of x and y, we cannot directly apply the property of the logarithmic function. This means that while x < y often leads to lg x < lg y, it's not a guaranteed outcome in every case due to the domain restrictions of the logarithmic function. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, we can conclude that \\"lg x < lg y\\" being true implies \\"x < y\\" due to the properties of the logarithmic function.

Then,    [    S' = sum_{i=1}^n f_i'    ]    Since each ( f_i' ) is either ( f_i + 1 ) or ( f_i - 1 ), the change in the number of friendships for each student is ( pm 1 ). Therefore, the total change in the sum of friendships ( S ) is:    [    S' = S + sum_{i=1}^n (pm 1)    ] 4. **Change in the sum of friendships:**    Since each student's number of friends changes by ( 1 ), the total change in ( S ) is the sum of ( n ) terms, each of which is ( pm 1 ). Thus, the change in ( S ) is an integer ( k ) where ( k ) is the sum of ( n ) terms of ( pm 1 ). Therefore,    [    S' = S + k    ]    where ( k ) is an odd number because the number of students ( n ) is odd (as per our assumption). 5. **Contradiction with the nature of friendships:**    Each friendship involves a pair of students. Therefore, any change in the number of friendships involves either forming a new friendship (which adds ( 2 ) to ( S )) or breaking an existing friendship (which subtracts ( 2 ) from ( S )). Thus, the change in ( S ) must be an even number. 6. **Conclusion:**    We have a contradiction because we assumed that ( n ) is odd, which led to the change in ( S ) being an odd number, but the nature of friendships dictates that the change in ( S ) must be even. Therefore, our assumption that ( n ) is odd is incorrect.

These circles intersect the segments ( [BC], [CA], [AB] ) at points ( A_{1}, A_{2}; B_{1}, B_{2}; C_{1}, C_{2} ) respectively. 2. **Radical Axes Properties**:    The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points such that the power of the points with respect to both circles is equal. Let us consider the radical axis of ( Gamma_{1} ) and ( Gamma_{2} ).        The radical axis passes through ( H ) (since ( H ) is common to both circles) and by definition of the radical axis of circles centered at ( D ) and ( E ), it is perpendicular to the line ( DE ).  3. **Parallel Lines and Perpendicular Relationships**:    Since ( D ) and ( E ) are midpoints of ( [BC] ) and ( [CA] ) respectively, ( DE ) is parallel to ( AB ).

Since each pair of circles intersects at the orthocenter ( H ) and each pair’s radical axis involves ( CH, AH, BH ) respectively, these radical axes must concur at ( H ). 6. **Conclusion**:    Since ( A_{1}, A_{2}, B_{1}, B_{2}, C_{1}, C_{2} ) lie on the intersections of these radical axes, they must all lie on a common circle.

Therefore, ( angle ABC = 2alpha ) because ( angle ABC ) is the arc opposite ( CDA ).     - Likewise, ( angle BCD = pi - 2beta ), and since ( ABCD ) is cyclic, ( angle DAB = 2beta ). 5. **Construct Point (F)**:     - Let the circumcircle of ( triangle ABE ) intersect line ( CD ) again at ( F ).     - Assume ( F ) lies on the same side of ( E ) as ( D ). 6. **Angles in Cyclic Quadrilateral ( ABEF )**:     - Since ( ABEF ) is cyclic:         - ( angle ABF = angle AEF = alpha = angle ABC/2 ).         - ( angle FAB = pi - angle BEF = beta = angle DAB/2 ). 7. **Intersection of Angle Bisectors**:     - Point ( F ) lies on the bisector of ( angle DAB ) because:         - ( angle FAB = angle DAB/2 ).     - Point ( F ) also lies on the bisector of ( angle ABC ) since:         - ( angle ABF = angle ABC/2 ). 8. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, the intersection point of the angle bisectors of ( angle A ) and ( angle B ) lies on ( CD ), concluding the proof.

What is the value of a?","output":"The problem involves determining a value of (a) where Xiaohua plays a game and can score either 8, (a) (a non-negative integer), or 0 points in each round. The total scores Xiaohua has obtained in some games are 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, and 110; additionally, it is known that 83 is an impossible total score. 1. **Analyzing Total Score 107**:    Given the total score of 107, we first rule out the possibility of all 8-point scores:    [ 83 + 8 times 3 = 107 ]    If there were more than 3 rounds scored 8 points, then:    [ 107 - 3 times 8 = 83 ]    But since 83 is not possible, it means that the rounds scored 8 points must be fewer than 3. Therefore, possible scores are with rounds of 8 points being 0, 1, or 2. Considering these:    [    107, quad 107 - 1 times 8 = 99, quad 107 - 2 times 8 = 91    ]    One of these scores must be a multiple of (a). 2. **Examining Multiples of (a)**:    - If 107 is a multiple of (a):      [      107 = k cdot a Rightarrow a = 1  text{or}  107 quad(text{since 107 is prime})      ]      - (a = 1): Infers 83 could occur since (83 = 83 times 1), which contradicts the problem statement.      - (a = 107): Is not feasible because other scores cannot be obtained.    - If 99 is a multiple of (a):      [      99 = k cdot a Rightarrow a = 1, 3, 9, 11, 33,  99 quad (text{factors of 99})      ]      - (a = 1), (3), (9), (11): Each allows configuration to form 83:        [        83 = 9 times 3 + 8 times 7, quad 83 = 11 times 7 + 8         ]      - So, only 33 and 99 must be considered:        [        - a  =  33  text{contradicts 103 because}  103 = 3 times 33 + 4         ]        [        - a = 99 text{contradicts other scores}        ]    - If 91 is a multiple of (a):      [      91 = k cdot a Rightarrow a = 1, 7, 13, 91      ]      - (a = 1) or (7): Allows configuration for 83:        [        83 = 7 times 5 + 8 times 6         ]      - (a = 91): Contradicts other scores arrangement.      - So, (a = 13) is the possible value conforming to constraints.

We analyze the propagation of this inequality through the system:    - If (x_a le a), then (max{a, x_a} = a), so (x_{a+1} = a). This implies (x_{a+1} = x_{a+2} = ldots = x_n = x_1 = ldots = x_{a-1} = 1), leading to a contradiction since (x_a > 1).    - Therefore, (x_a > a), and thus (x_{a+1} = frac{x_a}{a} > 1). 5. **Inductive Argument**:    We can use induction to show that (x_i > i) for all (i):    - Base case: (x_a > a).    - Inductive step: Assume (x_i > i) for some (i). Then (x_{i+1} = frac{x_i}{i} > 1). 6. **Contradiction**:    If (x_i > i) for all (i), then:    [    x_a = frac{x_a}{(a-1)(a-2)ldots(1)(n)(n-1)ldots(a)}.    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    x_a = x_a cdot n!,    ]    which implies (x_a = 0), a contradiction since (x_a > 1). 7. **Conclusion**:    Since any assumption of (x_a > 1) leads to a contradiction, the only possible solution is (x_i = 1) for all (i).

We will follow these steps to demonstrate the equivalence. 1. **Definitions and Lemma:**    - Define a function satisfying condition 1 as a \\"holey\\" function.    - Define a function satisfying condition 2 as a \\"presentable\\" function.    - Consider functions defined on the entire real line, except possibly for a finite number of points.    - Note that equivalence of functions is understood as equivalence in their domain of definition, meaning equivalence up to a finite number of points.    Recall that a function equivalent to ( f ) can change its range only in finitely many points; therefore, it cannot turn a holey function into a non-holey one and vice versa. 2. **Observation:**    - The given function ( f(x) ) is not a fractional-linear function since the equality (frac{x^2 + ax + b}{x^2 + cx + d} = frac{alpha x + beta}{gamma x + delta}) would imply a common factor between the numerator and the denominator on the left-hand side, which is excluded. 3. **Lemma:**    Let ( h(x) ) be a fractional-linear function, and ( g(x) ) be an arbitrary function.        a) If functions ( g(x), g(h(x)), ) and ( h(g(x)) ) are all presentable, or all non-presentable.        b) If functions ( g(x), g(h(x)), ) and ( h(g(x)) ) are all holey, or all non-holey.        **Proof of Lemma:**    a) This is obvious since the function inverse to a fractional-linear one is also fractional-linear.        b) Suppose ( g(x) ) does not take values in interval ( I ). Then ( g(h(x)) ) does not take values in this interval. On the other hand, in the interval ( I ), there is an interval ( J ) entirely contained in the domain of the function ( h(x) ). By monotonicity, ( h(J) ) is also an interval, and function ( h(g(x)) ) does not take values on it due to the one-to-one correspondence.        The rest follows from the equalities ( g(x) = g(h(h^{-1}(x))) = h^{-1}(h(g(x))) ) and properties of the fractional-rational function. 4. **Implications for Compositions:**    Given the Lemma, composing a function with a fractional-linear function preserves both holeyness and presentability. This allows us to prove the required property for the simplified function obtained by compositions with fractional-linear functions. 5. **Proving the Assertions:**    1. **If the function is presentable, then it is holey.**           Suppose ( f(x) = frac{x^2 + ax + b}{x^2 + cx + d} ) is presentable, i.e. can be written in the form given above.           Let ( k ) be the smallest index where ( f_k(x) = x^2 ). Such an index exists, otherwise, ( f(x) ) would be fractional-linear.           Then the function ( g(x) = f_k(f_{k+1}(ldots(f_n(x))ldots)) = (f_{k+1}(ldots(f_n(x))ldots))^2 ) is holey since it does not take negative values.           On the other hand, ( h(x) = f_1(f_2(ldots f_{k-1}(x))) ) is fractional-linear (as a composition of fractional-linear functions).           Therefore, ( f(x) = h(g(x)) ) is a holey function.        2. **If the function is holey, then it is presentable.**           Suppose there is an interval not containing the values of ( f(x) ). Simplify the function as much as possible using compositions with fractional-linear functions.           Subtract 1 from ( f(x) ) and invert it, yielding a function of the form ( frac{x^2 + cx + d}{px + q} ).           If ( p = 0 ), multiplying by ( q ) results in a function representable in the desired form: ( x^2 + cx + d = (x + c / 2)^2 + d - c^2 / 4 ).           If ( p neq 0 ), perform a linear substitution ( z = px + q ), obtaining a function of the form:       [       frac{A x^2 + B x + C}{x} = Ax + frac{C}{x} + B       ]           Subtract ( B ) and divide by ( A ), obtaining:       [       x + frac{D}{x}       ]           Notice that ( D neq 0 ); otherwise, ( f(x) ) would be fractional-linear.

We need to solve the equation: [ frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = 1 ] # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Assumptions:**    - Without loss of generality, assume ( a leq b leq c ). This assumption helps us reduce the number of cases to check. 2. **Case 1: Inclusion of ( frac{1}{2} ):**    - Consider if one of the fractions is ( frac{1}{2} ). Then we have:      [      frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = 1 Rightarrow frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = frac{1}{2}      ]    - To satisfy this, ( frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} ) must sum to ( frac{1}{2} ). Let's evaluate possible values for ( frac{1}{b} ) and ( frac{1}{c} ):      - If ( frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{3} ), then:        [        frac{1}{c} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} = frac{3 - 2}{6} = frac{1}{6} Rightarrow c = 6        ]        Therefore, one solution is:        [        1 = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6}        ]      - If ( frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{4} ), then:        [        frac{1}{c} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} = frac{2 - 1}{4} = frac{1}{4} Rightarrow c = 4        ]        Therefore, another solution is:        [        1 = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4}        ] 3. **Case 2: Exclusion of ( frac{1}{2} ):**    - When ( frac{1}{2} ) is not included, each fraction ( frac{1}{a} ), ( frac{1}{b} ), and ( frac{1}{c} ) must be at most ( frac{1}{3} ).

The median is the line through a vertex of the triangle and the midpoint of the opposite side. In this case, the line through B and the midpoint M of overline{AC} serves this purpose. This is because the median divides the triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area. This division is based on the fact that the two smaller triangles, triangle AMB and triangle CMB, have equal heights (the perpendicular distance from B to the line overline{AC}) and equal bases (AM=MC), thus ensuring their areas are equal. To calculate the coordinates of the midpoint M of overline{AC}, we use the midpoint formula: [M = left(frac{0+8}{2}, frac{8+0}{2}right) = (4, 4).] Next, we find the slope of the line through B(2, 0) and M(4, 4).

This means if we subtract a constant from every element in a set, the variance of the set does not change. First, let's consider the transformation of the second set by subtracting 2019 from each element: - 2020 - 2019 = 1 - 2021 - 2019 = 2 - 2022 - 2019 = 3 - 2023 - 2019 = 4 - 2024 - 2019 = 5 So, after subtracting 2019, the second set becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Let's denote this set of 10 integers by ( S = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{10} } ).    The total number of subsets of the set ( S ) is calculated by noting that each element can either be included or excluded from a subset independently. Thus, the total number of possible subsets of ( S ) is:    [    2^{10} = 1024    ]    This includes the empty subset and the set ( S ) itself. 2. **Calculating the Range of Possible Sums:**    The next step is to determine the range of possible sums of these subsets. The minimum sum of any non-empty subset occurs with the smallest element, which is 10. The maximum sum of any subset occurs with the sum of all 10 elements. The largest possible value for each of the 10 integers is 99. Therefore, the maximum possible sum is:    [    99 + 98 + 97 + ldots + 90    ]    Simplifying this (by noting it's an arithmetic series sum), we have:    [    text{Maximum sum} < 10 times 99 = 990    ]    Since we only need an approximate upper bound, we know it’s less than 1000. 3. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:**    Since we are only interested in distinct sums, the number of distinct sums of subsets we can form must be less than 1000 (from 10 up to 990).     We now apply the Pigeonhole Principle. Considering there are 1024 subsets and fewer than 1000 possible distinct sums, by the Pigeonhole Principle:    [    1024 text{ subsets } > 1000 text{ possible sums}    ]    This guarantees that at least two of these subsets must have the same sum. 4. **Ensuring Disjoint Subsets:**    Let ( A ) and ( B ) be two subsets of ( S ) such that ( text{sum}(A) = text{sum}(B) ). These subsets ( A ) and ( B ) may not necessarily be disjoint. If ( A ) and ( B ) overlap, let ( C = A cap B ). The subsets ( A' = A setminus C ) and ( B' = B setminus C ) will be disjoint since all the common elements have been removed.    Now, ( A' cup B' = (A setminus C) cup (B setminus C) ) consists of all elements that are in either ( A ) or ( B ) but not in both. The sums of ( A ) and ( B ) decrease by the sum of the elements of ( C ), so the new subsets must still have equal sums:    [    text{sum}(A') = text{sum}(A) - text{sum}(C) = text{sum}(B) - text{sum}(C) = text{sum}(B')    ] # Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that from any 10 integers chosen from the range 10 to 99, it is possible to find two disjoint subsets with the same sum.

The problem requires us to determine the values of b and c such that the graphs of the equations 3x + by + c = 0 and cx - 2y + 12 = 0 are the same. For the graphs to be the same, the coefficients of x, y, and the constant term must be proportional.    2. Let's denote the proportionality constant by k. Then, we can express the condition of proportionality as follows:    [    frac{3}{c} = frac{b}{-2} = frac{c}{12}    ] 3. To solve for b and c, we start with the first proportion:    [    frac{3}{c} = k    ]        which gives us    [    c = frac{3}{k}    ] 4. Next, we consider the second proportion:    [    frac{b}{-2} = k    ]    which implies    [    b = -2k    ] 5. Finally, we use the third proportion to solve for c:    [    frac{c}{12} = k    ]    which gives us    [    c = 12k    ] 6.

We will define an **operation** as selecting three distinct vertices (a, b, c) and increasing the label of edges (ab, bc, ca) by some real number (x in mathbb{R}). 2. **Objective**: It suffices to show that we can make all labels of the edges in the sub-graph equal to (1) and labels of all other edges equal to (0) with a finite number of operations. 3. **Case for (n le 4)**: For (n le 4), the only such sub-graphs are triangles, and so the problem is trivial with one operation. 4. **Case for (n ge 5)**: Suppose that (n ge 5). 5. **Lemma**: For any two edges (e_1, e_2) and any (x in mathbb{R}^{+}), there exists a finite number of operations which increase the label of (e_1) by (x), decrease the label of (e_2) by (x), and leave all other labels unchanged. 6. **Proof of Lemma**:    - **Case 1**: (e_1, e_2) do not share a vertex.      - Let (e_1 = ab) and (e_2 = cd), where (a, b, c, d) are distinct vertices. Then, apply the following four operations in order:        1. Increase the labels of edges (ab, bc, ca) by (frac{x}{2}).        2. Increase the labels of edges (ab, bd, da) by (frac{x}{2}).        3.

Then, select some other vertices (d, e), which exist because (n ge 5). Finally, simply use Case 1 of the lemma as follows:        1.

Increase the label of (de) by (x), and decrease the label of (ac) by (x).      - The result of the successive application of the two above processes yields the desired result. 7. **Conclusion of Lemma**: As a result of the lemma, if we view the labels of the edges as \\"wealth,\\" we can now essentially distribute wealth arbitrarily amongst the edges, as long as the total wealth of all edges remains constant. 8. **Final Step**: If the desired total wealth is (x), then we can simply increase (ab, bc, ca) by (frac{x}{3}) for some arbitrary three vertices (a, b, c), and then use the lemma to distribute this wealth into the desired configuration. 9. **Completion**: We are now done.

Mathematically, this implies that ( n^3 ) ends in the digits ( n ). 2. **Analyzing Various Values**    - We start by testing small values of ( n ) to understand the pattern:      - For ( n = 100 ):        [        n^3 = 100^3 = 1000000        ]        Deleting the last three digits, we get ( 1000 ), which is not equal to ( n = 100 ).      - For ( n = 9 ):        [        n^3 = 9^3 = 729        ]        Deleting the last three digits doesn't leave any meaningful number that could be ( n ) since ( n ) must be either a one-digit or two-digit number. 3. **Determining the Length of ( n )**    - From the above examples and the constraints, we infer ( n ) must be either a one-digit number (1-9) or a two-digit number (10-99):      - For ( n = 10 text{ to } 99 ):        - Cubing ( n ) should yield a number such that deleting its last three digits leaves ( n ).     4. **Narrowing Down the Possible Range**    - Represent ( n ) as ( 10a + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are digits.    - We need ( n^3 ) such that deleting its last three digits results in ( n ). So, we need:      [      n^3 = 1000k + n implies n^3 equiv n pmod{1000}      ]    - Given this, we can derive:      [      n(n^2 - 1) equiv 0 pmod{1000} quad text{(as } n neq 0 text{)}      ]    - Now, since ( 1000 ) factors as ( 2^3 times 5^3 ), we will search for values of ( n ) where ( n^2 ) is close to ( 1000 ) to ( 1100 ) but maintain cubic consistency.  5. **Testing Close Values**    - Specifically evaluate values close to ( sqrt{1000} approx 31.62 ):      - For ( n = 32 ):        [        32^2 = 1024 < 1100 quad text{and} quad 32^3 =  32768        ]        Deleting the last three digits (( 768 )), we get ( 32 ), which is correct.      - For ( n = 33 ):        [        33^2 = 1089 < 1100 quad text{and} quad 33^3 =  35937        ]        Deleting the last three digits (( 937 )), we get ( 35 ), which is not equal to ( n = 33 ). 6. **Conclusion**    - Only ( n = 32 ) satisfies the condition.

In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between successive terms is constant.

Hence, there are:         [         6 times 5 = 30 , text{horizontal segments}         ]         [         6 times 5 = 30 , text{vertical segments}         ]     Thus, the total number of shared edges (segments) is:         [         30 , (text{horizontal}) + 30 , (text{vertical}) = 60 , text{segments}         ] 2. **Understanding the Number Written in Each Cell**:     - When Sasha paints a cell, he writes a number in it which represents the number of shared edges with already painted neighboring cells.     - Therefore, each number written in a cell corresponds to the number of segments that were **not initially painted** but now have become **painted** because the current cell is painted. 3. **Summing up the Total Contributions**:     - As the grid fills up and every cell gets painted, let's focus on the \\"painting\\" of segments. Each segment can be shared by at most 2 cells.     - When Sasha sums up all the numbers written in the cells, he essentially counts how many times the shared segments between cells were responsible for the numbers written. 4. **Contribution of Each Segment**:     - Since each edge is shared by two cells, the total contribution of each segment is counted exactly twice - once from each neighboring cell that shares that segment.     - During the entire process of filling all cells:         - Each of the 60 segments will have been contributing to the count exactly twice. 5. **Summing All the Written Numbers**:     - The total sum of all numbers written by Sasha is therefore exactly equal to twice the total number of segments.     - Mathematically, since there are 60 segments:         [         text{Total Sum} = 2 times 60 = 120         ] Therefore, regardless of the order in which Sasha paints the cells in the (6 times 6) grid, the sum of all numbers written in the cells will always equal 60. **Conclusion**:  [ boxed{60} ]"},{"instruction":"Alex pays 2.25 to take the bus.

This means F is the point on the circle such that DF is a diameter. 3. **Analyze the angles and tangency:**    - Given angle ABE = angle CBD, we can infer that angle ABE = angle CAD because angle CBD = angle CAD (both subtend the same arc CD in the circumcircle of ABCD).    - This implies that DA is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle ABE at A. 4. **Use the properties of the antipode:**    - Since F is the antipode of D, angle FAD = 90^circ because DF is a diameter.    - Since DA is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle ABE, angle O_1AD = 90^circ (tangent-radius property). 5. **Collinearity of points F, O_1, and A:**    - From the above, angle FAD = angle O_1AD = 90^circ, which means points F, O_1, and A are collinear. 6. **Analogous argument for C and O_2:**    - Similarly, we can show that DC is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle CBE at C.    - Since F is the antipode of D, angle FCD = 90^circ.    - Since DC is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle CBE, angle O_2CD = 90^circ.    - Therefore, points F, O_2, and C are collinear. 7. **Conclusion:**    - Since F is the antipode of D and lies on both AO_1 and CO_2, and DO passes through F (as F is on the circumcircle of triangle ABC), lines DO, AO_1, and CO_2 are concurrent at point F.

First, let's find the value of (2q - p) and (2q + p) using the given ratio p / q = 4 / 5. Since p / q = 4 / 5, we can say that p = 4k and q = 5k for some constant k.

Now, let's find the values of (2q - p) and (2q + p) using p = 4k and q = 5k: (2q - p) = (2 * 5k - 4k) = (10k - 4k) = 6k (2q + p) = (2 * 5k + 4k) = (10k + 4k) = 14k Now we can substitute these values into the expression: { ( 2 q - p ) / ( 2 q + p ) } = (6k) / (14k) Since k is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, we can simplify the fraction by canceling out k: (6k) / (14k) = 6 / 14 = 3 / 7 Now we have the simplified value of the expression inside the brackets.

Given that C is an angle in (0, pi), we conclude that C = dfrac{pi}{6}.   [ boxed{C = dfrac{pi}{6}} ] (II) Since A+B+C=pi, we have A+B=dfrac{5pi}{6}.   Hence, sin B - sqrt{3}sin A = sinleft(dfrac{5pi}{6} - Aright) - sqrt{3}sin A = dfrac{1}{2}cos A - dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin A = cosleft(A + dfrac{pi}{3}right).   As A + B = dfrac{5pi}{6}, it implies that A in (0, dfrac{5pi}{6}), and thus A + dfrac{pi}{3} in left(dfrac{pi}{3}, dfrac{7pi}{6}right).   Therefore, the minimum value of cos(A+dfrac{pi}{3}) is -1, which corresponds to the minimum value of sin B - sqrt{3}sin A.

Our goal is to color the vertices in such a way that each white vertex has at least as many black neighbors as white neighbors, and each black vertex has at least as many white neighbors as black neighbors. 2. **Maximization Principle**: Among all possible bicolorations (colorings of the graph where vertices are either black or white), choose a bicoloration that maximizes the number of bicolored edges (edges with endpoints of different colors). 3. **Assumption for Contradiction**: Assume, for contradiction, that there exists a vertex coloring that does not satisfy the required condition. Without loss of generality, assume there is a white vertex ( A ) that has more white neighbors than black neighbors. 4. **Notation and Quantities**: Let ( W(A) ) represent the set of white neighbors of ( A ) and ( B(A) ) represent the set of black neighbors of ( A ).     - By our assumption, ( |W(A)| > |B(A)| ).     - The number of monochromatic edges incident to ( A ) (edges connecting ( A ) to other white vertices) is ( |W(A)| ).     - The number of bicolored edges incident to ( A ) (edges connecting ( A ) to black vertices) is ( |B(A)| ). 5. **Color Inversion**: Imagine we invert the color of vertex ( A ), changing it from white to black.     - After inversion, ( A ) will join the set of black vertices.     - The edges ( (A, text{neighbors in } W(A)) ) which were previously monochromatic (white-white) will now become bicolored (black-white).     - The edges ( (A, text{neighbors in } B(A)) ) which were bicolored (white-black) will become monochromatic (black-black). 6. **Impact on the Number of Bicolored Edges**: The total number of newly formed bicolored edges will be ( |W(A)| ), while the number of bicolored edges removed will be ( |B(A)| ).     - Since ( |W(A)| > |B(A)| ), the number of bicolored edges increases.     - Thus, this inversion results in a strict increase in the number of bicolored edges. 7. **Contradiction**: This contradicts our initial choice of the coloring scheme that maximizes the number of bicolored edges. Hence, our assumption that such a problematic vertex ( A ) exists must be false. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, each vertex must satisfy the required condition, meaning each coloring configuration that maximizes the number of bicolored edges must ensure:     - Every white vertex has at least as many black neighbors as white neighbors.     - Every black vertex has at least as many white neighbors as black neighbors.

We will use the duality principle, particularly focusing on the dual of Pappus's theorem. The application of the dual theorem ensures that if a problem is true, its dualized version is also true. 2. **Understanding Duality in Projective Geometry:**    - In projective geometry, duality is a principle that allows one to interchange points and lines. Specifically, for a given configuration, if we replace each point with its dual line and each line with its dual point, the resulting dual configuration retains the properties of the original configuration.    - A specific instance of this principle is the pole-polar duality with respect to a circle: replacing each point by its polar line and each line by its pole (intersection of its tangent lines). 3. **Application of Brianchon's Theorem as a Special Case:**    - Brianchon's Theorem states:      \`\`\`      In a hexagon ABCDEF where each pair of opposite sides intersects in points that are consecutive vertices of the same conic section (e.g., a circle), the diagonals AD, BE, and CF are concurrent.      \`\`\`    - In our problem, consider dualizing with respect to a conic section (here a circle mathcal{C}).      - Given a hexagon ABCDEF inscribed in a circle mathcal{C}, the dual points with respect to mathcal{C} are associated to the sides of the original hexagon.      - The theorem asserts that the lines joining opposite vertices of the hexagon, which are (AD), (BE), and (CF), will meet at a common point. 4. **Establishing the Duality Link to Our Problem:**    - The setup of our original problem with two sets of concurrent lines is analogous to the vertices and sides of a hexagon inscribed in a circle in Brianchon's theorem.    - The lines a, b, c and a', b', c' of the original triples being concurrent implies that they behave similarly to the hexagon's sides and vertices.      - x: Line joining a cap b' and b cap a' (dual equivalent of a hexagon's edge intersection).      - y: Line joining a cap c' and c cap a'.      - z: Line joining b cap c' and c cap b'. 5. **Conclusion via the Dual Theorem:**    - Given the duality principle applied to Pappus's theorem (dualized using a circle), we conclude that the lines x, y, and z must be concurrent because their dual configuration retains the properties of the original configuration – as expressed in Brianchon's theorem. 6.

For ①, since the curve passes through P(1,0), substituting x = 1 into f(x) = x + ax^2 + bln x, we get 0 = 1 + a + bln 1 = 1 + a. Therefore, a = -1.   Given that the slope of the tangent line at P is 2, we find the derivative of f(x), which is f'(x) = 1 + 2ax + frac{b}{x}. Substituting x = 1 and a = -1 into it, we get 2 = 1 - 2 + frac{b}{1}, thus b = 3. So, we have boxed{a = -1, b = 3}. For ②, we need to prove f(x) leq 2x - 2.

Solving -2x + frac{3}{x} - 1 = 0, we can find the maximum or minimum points of g(x), and by analyzing the change of the sign of g'(x), we can determine the intervals where g(x) is increasing or decreasing.   Without the specific process of solving and analyzing g'(x), we can't directly provide the proof here, but the key idea is to show that g(x) reaches its maximum at a certain point x_0 and g(x_0) leq 0. If this is true for x_0, and considering the behavior of g(x) for all x > 0, we can conclude that g(x) leq 0 for all x > 0, which means f(x) leq 2x - 2 is proven.

Conclusion:    - Whether starting from A and connecting points B, C, cdots or using induction, you see that the addition of another point does not introduce more pairs than n.

Because triangle CPE and triangle DPE are isosceles: [ angle PCE = angle PEC = x quad text{and} quad angle PED = angle PDE = y ] 3.

By expanding, we note that this will be a sum of terms of the form: [ (sqrt{pi_1} + sqrt{pi_2} + sqrt{pi_3})^{2i+1} = (sqrt{pi_1} + sqrt{pi_2} + sqrt{pi_3})(sqrt{pi_1} + sqrt{pi_2} + sqrt{pi_3})^{2i} ] Selecting exactly one term from each factor in the sum and permuting products of these will give us a collection of terms (3^{2i+1}) of form [ s(a, b, c) = (sqrt{pi_1})^a (sqrt{pi_2})^b (sqrt{pi_3})^c ] where (a + b + c = 2i + 1). If all (a, b, c) are odd, they form terms (d sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3}). If (a) is odd, the resultant form is (e sqrt{pi_1}). Proceeded similarly for (b) and (c). No two-exponent terms follow this odd-sum constraint. So, [ s = n sqrt{pi_1} + m sqrt{pi_2} + k sqrt{pi_3} + l sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3} ] 2. Likewise using the expressions involving differences of square roots, we have similar results for (s), (p), (q), and (r): [ begin{aligned} p &= (-sqrt{pi_1} + sqrt{pi_2} + sqrt{pi_3})^{2i+1} = -n sqrt{pi_1} + m sqrt{pi_2} + k sqrt{pi_3} - l sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3}  q &= (sqrt{pi_1} - sqrt{pi_2} + sqrt{pi_3})^{2i+1} = n sqrt{pi_1} - m sqrt{pi_2} + k sqrt{pi_3} - l sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3}  r &= (sqrt{pi_1} + sqrt{pi_2} - sqrt{pi_3})^{2i+1} = n sqrt{pi_1} + m sqrt{pi_2} - k sqrt{pi_3} - l sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3} end{aligned} ] From the equalities, [ frac{1}{2}(q + r) = n sqrt{pi_1} - l sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3} ] and [ frac{1}{2}(s - p) = n sqrt{pi_1} + l sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3} ] Thus, [ frac{q+r}{s-p} = frac{n sqrt{pi_1} - l sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3}}{n sqrt{pi_1} + l sqrt{pi_1 pi_2 pi_3}} = frac{1 - sqrt{pi_2 pi_3} frac{l}{n}}{1 + sqrt{pi_2 pi_3} frac{l}{n}} ] Setting ( x = sqrt{pi_2 pi_3} frac{l}{n} ), [1 - x = frac{q+r}{s-p}(1+x)] Given, [ sqrt{pi_2 pi_3} frac{l}{n} approx 1 ] yielding [  0 < 1 - x < 4 frac{Q^{2i+1}}{1- Q^{2i+1}} ] Hence, [ 1 - 4 frac{Q^{2i+1}}{1- Q^{2i+1}} < x < 1] This result ensures (1 - 10^{-500} < sqrt{3 cdot 5 cdot 7} frac{l}{n} < 1) for large (i). Finally, the number ((sqrt{3} + sqrt{5} + sqrt{7})^{2021}) is indeed of the desired form, [boxed{n sqrt{3} + m sqrt{5} + k sqrt{7} + l sqrt{3 cdot 5 cdot 7}}]"},{"instruction":"Three fair, standard sixsided dice are rolled.

This means that the calculation of hours worked together based on the given hourly rates and total payment is incorrect. To find the correct number of hours they worked together, we need to divide the total payment by the sum of their hourly rates: The sum of their hourly rates is: 12 (bricklayer) + 16 (electrician) = 28 per hour Now, we divide the total payment by the sum of their hourly rates to find the total hours they worked together: 1350 / 28 = 48.2142857 hours Since they both worked the same number of hours, we can assume they worked together for the entire time.

For 11 to be the greatest prime factor of f(m), m must be such that it includes 11 as a factor but does not include any prime numbers greater than 11.

The problem involves the sum of the fractions of the form (frac{1}{m^n}).     2. **Key property of the numbers**:    Note that among the numbers from 1 to 1986, only two numbers, 729 and 1458, are special in that they are divisible by (3^8):    [    729 = 3^6    ]    [    1458 = 2 cdot 3^6    ] 3. **Sum of fractions with common denominators**:    To find the sum of (frac{1}{m^n}), it is helpful to first focus on bringing all fractions to a common denominator, except for the product (frac{1}{729 times 1458}):    - The least common multiple of (3^6) and (2 cdot 3^6) is:       [      text{lcm}(729, 1458) = 2 cdot 3^6      ]    - Moreover, the least common multiple of the numbers (3^8) simplifies to (3) raised to some power multiplied by other small integer (b). This allows us to express the sum as:      [      frac{a}{3^8 cdot b} text{ where } b text{ does not divide by } 3      ] 4. **Simplifying the sum**:    By simplifying the sum of fractions other than (frac{1}{729 times 1458}), we attempt to express it in a form where (a) is an integer, and hence the result is not an integer overall. Here (b) should not be divisible by 3, precluding the fraction from reducing to an integer. 5. **Conclusion**:    Sum all terms (frac{1}{m^n}) can be verified not to form a whole number since (frac{1}{729 times 1458}) does not conveniently align with forming a complete whole number when considering (b) as defined above. Thus, the sum of all the numbers of the form (frac{1}{m^n}) where (1 leq m < n leq 1986) and (m, n) are natural numbers cannot be an integer.

Rectangle of the form 1 times k: A rectangle of size 1 times k contains only one row and k columns. Since a (1,2)-domino has a width of 2, it would not be possible to cover a row of length k using (1,2)-dominoes unless k is an even number. Even if k is an even number, arranging (1,2)-dominoes lengthwise on a single-row rectangle would completely cover it, as follows: - For (k in mathbb{2mathbb{Z}^+}), we can always place frac{k}{2} dominos next to each other to cover the row. However, notice if (k) is odd (k in mathbb{2mathbb{Z}^+ + 1}), we cannot cover the rectangle completely since a domino would need an extra space which is unavailable because of the odd length. Thus, for (1 times k), if (k) is not a multiple of 2, it cannot be (1,2)-tileable. For even numbers, there are no restrictions other than (k) being an even number hence it cannot be k=4k' as in a multiple of another even sequence.  2. Rectangle of the form 2 times n where 4 nmid n: Consider a rectangle of size (2 times n), where (4 nmid n). To show that this configuration cannot be (1,2)-tileable under the given constraint, we employ a checkerboard coloring argument: - Color the first two columns black, the next two columns white, the subsequent two columns black, and continue this pattern alternately throughout the rectangle. In this color pattern: - Every (1,2) domino will cover two adjacent squares, one black and one white. - For the rectangle to be tileable by (1,2) dominoes, the number of black squares must equal the number of white squares. In a (2 times n) rectangle: - Each pair of columns alternately colored implies there are n columns:     - If n is even, (n = 2m) can be achieved irrespective of 4-divisibility directly falling under color balance.     - When (4 mid n), each set of 4 columns provides an equal number of alternating color sequences. But, if (4 nmid n), partitioning will break a balanced color sequence creating an imbalance in one of the two colors: Suppose (n = 4m + r), where (r) denotes the remainder. If (r neq 0), thus non-divisibility of 4 breaks appropriate color pair balance. Therefore, if (4 nmid n), your color counts (either black or white squares) are imbalanced: begin{align*} text{Number of black columns} &= m + leftlfloor frac{r}{2} rightrfloor, text{Number of white columns} &= m. end{align*} Since (r) in this condition implies unequal count thus failing tiling might deemed non-achievable as a result.

This problem tests the application of the sine function of the sum of two angles and the relationship of quotients, focusing on simplification and transformation skills."},{"instruction":"Now look at two caskets, decorated with the following inscriptions: | On the gold casket | On the silver casket | | : | : | | The silver casket | The gold casket | | was made by Bellini’s son | was made by Cellini’s son | Prove that at least one of these two caskets was made by either Bellini or Cellini.","output":"1. **Assume the statement on the golden box lid to be true**:     [     text{textit{\\"The silver box was made by Bellini's son.\\"}}     ] 2. **Consider the implications of this assumption**:     1. If the statement on the golden box lid is true, then:         [         text{textit{\\"The silver box was made by Bellini's son\\" is true.}}         ]     2. Now, according to the statement on the silver box lid:         [         text{textit{\\"The golden box was made by Cellini's son.\\"}}         ]     3. If both statements are true, then both sons are assigned to the making of the opposite boxes:         [         text{textit{\\"Silver box was made by Bellini's son.\\"}} implies text{textit{\\"Golden box was made by Cellini's son.\\"}}         ] 3. **Identify Contradiction**:     1. If the statement on the golden box lid is true, then everything works consistently.     2. However, if both statements are true, they would contradict each other because they state that each box was made by a different son. To be specific:         [         text{textit{\\"The silver box was made by Bellini's son.\\"}} quad & quad text{textit{\\"The golden box was made by Cellini's son.\\"}}         ]     3. This assumption leads to the contradiction that an invalid combination of these sons making the boxes is possible. 4. **Conclude the assumption’s invalidity**:     - Thus, we conclude that our initial assumption that the statement on the golden box lid is true, led us to a contradiction. Consequently, the statement on the golden box lid must be false. 5. **Assertions about the boxes based on the new understanding**:     - Since the statement on the golden box lid is false, the true statement is:         [         text{textit{\\"The silver box was not made by Bellini's son.\\"}}         ]     - Therefore, the silver box was not made by Bellini's son, which means that it must have been made by Cellini’s son. 6. **Evaluate the falsity of the statements and their contents**:     - For the silver box statement:         [         text{textit{\\"The golden box was made by Cellini's son.\\"}}          ]     - Because we reasoned that the statement on the golden box was false:         [         text{textit{\\"The silver box was made by Bellini's son.\\" is false.}}         ]     - Therefore, considering the respective consistency of the boxes:         If the golden box wasn’t made by Cellini's son, then it must have been made by Bellini's son. 7. **Final Conclusion**:     - One of these consistent conclusions from this logic is:         [         text{Either the silver box was made by Bellini or the golden box was made by Cellini's son.}         ]    Hence, by ensuring at least one of these is correct, the contradiction ensures that it’s valid in the deduction.

After she visited a supermarket there were 159 dollars left. She spent 89 dollars. How much money did she collect from the atm?","output":"Let's call the amount of money Olivia collected from the ATM \\"x\\" dollars. Before going to the supermarket, Olivia had her original 100 plus the \\"x\\" dollars she collected from the ATM. So we can write this as: 100 + x After visiting the supermarket, Olivia had 159 left. We know that she spent 89 at the supermarket. So, before she spent the 89, she must have had: 159 + 89 Now we can set up the equation: 100 + x = 159 + 89 Solving for x: x = 159 + 89 - 100 x = 248 - 100 x = 148 So, Olivia collected boxed{148}  from the ATM."},{"instruction":"An error of some percentage in excess is made while measuring the side of a square. The percentage of error in the calculated area of the square is 8.16%.

The error percentage in measuring the side is what we want to find. The actual area of the square is ( A = S^2 ), and the calculated (erroneous) area is ( A' = S'^2 ). Given that the error in the area is 8.16%, we can write: [ A' = A + 0.0816A ] [ A' = 1.0816A ] Since ( A' = S'^2 ) and ( A = S^2 ), we have: [ S'^2 = 1.0816S^2 ] Taking the square root of both sides to find the relationship between ( S' ) and ( S ): [ S' = Ssqrt{1.0816} ] Now, let's calculate the square root of 1.0816: [ sqrt{1.0816} approx 1.04 ] So, the measured side length ( S' ) is approximately 1.04 times the actual side length ( S ). The percentage error in measuring the side is the difference between ( S' ) and ( S ) relative to ( S ), expressed as a percentage: [ text{Percentage error} = left( frac{S' - S}{S} right) times 100% ] Substituting ( S' = 1.04S ): [ text{Percentage error} = left( frac{1.04S - S}{S} right) times 100% ] [ text{Percentage error} = (1.04 - 1) times 100% ] [ text{Percentage error} = 0.04 times 100% ] [ text{Percentage error} = 4% ] Therefore, the percentage of error made while measuring the side of the square is boxed{4%} ."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],L={key:0},N={key:1};function W(n,e,h,u,o,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(i(!0),a(w,null,y(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(i(),v(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
