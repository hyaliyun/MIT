Every three deputies form a committee. Find the total number of committees in which all three members are either all friends or all enemies. 1. We start by noting that each deputy can form a triangle (committee) with any two other deputies. Represent the deputies as points in a graph. Connect the points with a red edge if the corresponding deputies are friends and with a blue edge if they are enemies. 2. We are looking to find the number of monochromatic triangles (committees) in which all three members are friends (red triangles) or all three members are enemies (blue triangles). 3. The total number of triangles that can be formed with 30 deputies is given by      [     binom{30}{3} = frac{30 times 29 times 28}{3 times 2 times 1} = 4060.     ] 4. Let us count the number of non-monochromatic triangles (triangles that are not all red or all blue). In each non-monochromatic triangle, exactly two of the angles are formed with edges of different colors (one red and one blue edge). We will refer to such angles as mixed-color angles. 5. Since each deputy has exactly (6) friends, it implies that they have (30 - 1 - 6 = 23) enemies. 6. For a fixed deputy, there are (6 times 23 = 138) mixed-color angles formed by pairing their 6 friends with 23 enemies. 7.

This greatest common divisor (gcd) ( R_i ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. The Euclidean algorithm ensures that ( R_i ) has integer coefficients if both ( P_i ) and ( P_i circ Q ) do.  3. **Reducibility Condition**:    If ( R_i neq 1 ) (i.e., ( R_i ) is non-trivial), then ( P_i circ Q ) is not irreducible. This is because a non-trivial gcd indicates that ( P_i ) and ( P_i circ Q ) share a common factor. 4. **Identifying Common Roots**:    Suppose ( P_i ) and ( P_i circ Q ) have a common root ( r ). Then, both ( P_i(r) = 0 ) and ( P_i(Q(r)) = 0 ). This implies that the polynomial ( mu_r ) (the minimal polynomial of ( r )) divides both ( P_i ) and ( P_i circ Q ), confirming a non-trivial gcd. 5. **Constructing ( Q )**:    Construct the polynomial ( Q ) as follows:    [    Q(X) = left( prod_{i=1}^{n} P_i(X) right) + X    ]    Here, ( prod_{i=1}^n P_i ) is the product of all polynomials ( P_i ). 6. **Evaluating ( Q )**:    For a root ( r ) of ( P_i ):    [    Q(r) = left( prod_{i=1}^n P_i(r) right) + r    ]    Since ( r ) is a root of ( P_i ), we have ( P_i(r) = 0 ).

The 5000th number is within this range.    - The exact position within the 50th turn (150 numbers spoken) is (5000 - 4900 = 100).

Let's delve into each part in detail.  Part (1): We start with the given definition: [ Z(a, b)=frac{(3a)!(4b)!}{(a!)^{4}(b!)^{3}} ] To show (Z(a, b)) is a non-negative integer for (a leqslant b), we will express (Z(a, b)) in terms of binomial coefficients and explore its components.

This confirms that (Z(a, b)) is a non-negative integer for any (a leq b).  Part (2): We must show that for any given non-negative integer (b), there exist infinitely many integers (a) such that (Z(a, b)) is not an integer. Assume (b) is a given non-negative integer.

We are given that:    [    x + y + z = 320 quad text{(since there are 320 boxes in total)}    ]     2. We need to show that we can choose several boxes such that the total number of balls is exactly 1001.    Let's start by observing the product:    [    6 cdot 11 cdot 15 = 990    ]     3. We claim that it is possible to choose boxes such that their total number of balls is 990. Once we show this, adding one box with 11 balls will give us ( 990 + 11 = 1001 ). 4. Let's assume we pick ( x_1 ), ( y_1 ), and ( z_1 ) boxes that sum up to 990 balls:    [    6x_1 + 11y_1 + 15z_1 = 990    ] 5. We need to demonstrate the existence of non-negative integers ( x_1 ), ( y_1 ), and ( z_1 ) such that the equation above holds. Let:    [    x_1 = x, quad y_1 = y - 1, quad z_1 = z    ]    Hence, we are left with ( x, , y-1, text{ and } z ) boxes and need exactly 990 balls:    [    6x + 11(y-1) + 15z = 990    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    6x + 11y - 11 + 15z = 990 implies 6x + 11y + 15z = 1001    ]     6. Next, let's verify the possible distribution. If we couldn't achieve 990 balls with ( 6, 11, 15 ) ball boxes, the number of boxes with 6 balls would be less than:    [    leftlfloor frac{990}{6} rightrfloor = 165 quad text{(i.e., no more than 164)}    ]    Similarly, the number of boxes with 11 balls would be less than:    [    leftlfloor frac{990}{11} rightrfloor = 90 quad text{(i.e., no more than 89)}    ]    And the number of boxes with 15 balls would be less than:    [    leftlfloor frac{990}{15} rightrfloor = 66 quad text{(i.e., no more than 65)}    ] 7.

Since 7a^2 + 8ab + 4b^2 = 24, we can rewrite it as 3a^2 + 4(a + b)^2 = 24, which is equivalent to (sqrt{3}a)^2 + (2a + 2b)^2 = 24. According to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, ((sqrt{3}a)^2 + (2a + 2b)^2)((frac{1}{sqrt{3}})^2 + 1^2) geq (a + 2a + 2b)^2 = (3a + 2b)^2. Thus, (3a + 2b)^2 leq 24 times frac{4}{3} = 32. The equality holds if and only if frac{sqrt{3}a}{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} = frac{2a + 2b}{1}, which implies a = 2b. Substituting a = 2b into the original equation, we get 28b^2 + 16b^2 + 4b^2 = 24, which simplifies to b^2 = frac{1}{2}, hence b = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. 2.

This is achieved by letting (A = (0, 0)), (B = (3, 0)), and (C = (2, 2)). In this case, (P = (2, 1)) and (frac{AP}{PE} = 5). 2. **Optimality Proof:**    Let (x, y, z) be the areas of (triangle BPC), (triangle CPA), and (triangle APB), respectively. Note that (frac{AP}{PE} = frac{y+z}{x}). 3. **Lemma 1:**    (x le y+z, y le x+z, z le x+y).    **Proof:**    If not, then the reflection of (A) over (P) is also an interior point of (triangle ABC), which contradicts the uniqueness of (P). 4. **Lemma 2:**    (x, y, z le 3).    **Proof:**    By Pick's Theorem, it will be enough to show that segment (BC) contains at most 3 lattice points in its strict interior (not including (B, C)). Suppose that there were (ge 4) lattice points in the strict interior of segment (BC). Then, there exists a real number (0 < x le 0.2) so that (vec{v} = x cdot overrightarrow{BC}) is a vector with both components integral. But then, using Lemma 1, it's easy to check that one of (P + vec{v}, P - vec{v}) must be an interior lattice point of (triangle ABC). (blacksquare) 5. **Further Analysis:**    Furthermore, it's actually also true that segment (BC) has three lattice points in its strict interior if and only if (x = 2y = 2z), and similarly for segments (CA) and (AB). In these cases, it's easy to check that (frac{AP}{PE} le 3). 6. **Pick's Theorem Application:**    Hence, we may now suppose that each of segments (BC, CA, AB) has at most two lattice points in their strict interiors. By Pick's Theorem, we now know that (x, y, z le frac{3}{2}). Together with (x, y, z ge frac{1}{2}), these results yield that    [    frac{AP}{PE} = frac{y+z}{x} le frac{frac{3}{2} + frac{3}{2}}{frac{1}{2}} = 6.    ] 7. **Impossibility of Maximum:**    To show that this cannot be achieved, we need only to show that it's impossible for segments (BC, CA, AB) to have (0, 2, 2) lattice points in their strict interiors, respectively. To see this, observe that in this case we'd have that both (frac{1}{3} cdot overrightarrow{AB}, frac{1}{3} cdot overrightarrow{AC}) are vectors with both components integral, and so (A + frac{1}{3} cdot overrightarrow{AB} + frac{2}{3} cdot overrightarrow{AC}) is an interior point of (BC), contradiction.

The even integers in this range are 0, 2, 4, ..., 100. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 0 and the last term a_n = 100. The number of terms n can be found by the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where d is the common difference, which is 2 for even numbers. So, 100 = 0 + (n - 1) * 2 100 = (n - 1) * 2 n - 1 = 100 / 2 n - 1 = 50 n = 51 The average (arithmetic mean) of an arithmetic sequence is (a_1 + a_n) / 2, so the average of the even integers from 0 to 100 is (0 + 100) / 2 = 50. Next, let's find the average of the even integers from 0 to 50 inclusive. The even integers in this range are 0, 2, 4, ..., 50. Using the same approach as above, we find that the last term a_n = 50 and the first term a_1 = 0.

This can be expressed by the conditions:    - sinleft(b(-frac{7pi}{3b}) + cright) = 0    - sinleft(b(frac{5pi}{3b}) + cright) = 0    Thus, solving for phase shift c:    - -frac{7pi}{3} + c = -kpi (for integer k)    - frac{5pi}{3} + c = -mpi (for another integer m)    By adjusting these for k and m being integers, c can be determined, noting that the distance between asymptotes of csc function equals pi. Suppose k=2 for the first equation then 2pi - c = frac{7pi}{3} implies c = -frac{pi}{3}. 2. **Determine the amplitude a:** Given the minimum value of y at x=0 is the minimum value of csc function, it must be the amplitude a. Calculate y = a csc(-frac{pi}{3}). y reaches minimum positive value implies a = 2.  Thus, by evaluating csc(-frac{pi}{3}) = -frac{2}{sqrt{3}} (using value from standard trigonometric function table), solve a times (-frac{2}{sqrt{3}}) = 2. Thus, a = -sqrt{3}.

This set of squares for the first row satisfies the requirement. 2. **First Column Construction:**    Choose the first column's entries from the sequence of squares of powers of 2 up to ( 2^{12}):    [    begin{aligned}    &2^2 = 4,     &2^4 = 16,     &2^6 = 64,     &2^8 = 256,     &2^{10} = 1024,     &2^{12} = 4096,     &2^{14} = 16384,    end{aligned}    ]    Calculate their sum:    [    1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024 + 4096 + 16384 = 5461    ]    Now, if we add the last element to achieve an integer solution, we would pick:    [    k^2 = left(2730right)^2    ]    Then, the first column sums to:    [    (2k+1) + k^2 = 2731^2    ] 3. **Matrix Filling:**    For each element not in the first row or column, compute:    [    a_{ij} = a_{1j} times a_{i1}    ]    Given that both terms are squares, their product is also a square.    Each row's and each column's sums now need verification:    - Each row's sum equals the product of the sum of the first row squares and the square at (a_{i1}).    - Each column's sum equals the product of the sum of the first column squares and the square at (a_{1j}).    Both sums are squares since they result from squaring a sum. 4. **Uniqueness Check:**    Verify if the elements are unique across the  (8 times 8) grid:    - Row elements are distinct as sums involve unique prime factors and powers.    - Column elements are different since they progressively increase.    - The highest element from the first seven rows (19^2 times 2^{12}) is smaller than the smallest element in the last row, (2730^2).

However, this scenario seems less likely as a single digit sum flipping over needs justification from other parts of the numeration.  3. **Set Up equations from Left Columns:**    We create a system of equations from the values of ( text{К} ), ( text{И} ), ( text{Т} ), and the base ( d ):    Since the sum effects depend on carrying digits and balance exactly:    [    begin{cases}    2text{Т} = text{И}     text{Т} + 1 = text{К}     text{К} + text{И} = d        text{И} < d    text{К} < d    text{Т} < d    end{cases}    ] 4. **Plug in the Preliminary Substitute:**    Substitute ( text{К} ) from ( text{Т} + 1 )    [    2text{Т} = text{И} + d.    ]    From ( text{Т} + 1 = text{К} ) we have:    [    text{К} = Т + 1,    ]    Substitute ( text{И} ) Equation     [    text{К} = Т + 1 = (2text{Т}-d) + 1.    ] 5. **Solve the Equations:**    Upon solving for compatible single digits, consider typical values:    Check base ( d ) must fit    text{ Check  } is ( base 7 }    Verifying sums gives,    space 4350_7 + 43050_7 = 50430_7 6. **Verify and Conclude:**    This matching holds complete digit-by-digit compatibility for the solution: Thus, confirming computation and validated insertions: ( boxed{Solution text{: Base 7 and expressions hold.}} ) Conclusively ( boxed{The sum is check: correctness } ample bases each fitting computed boxed entries: boxed final answer: numeration and arithm.}"},{"instruction":"Given that the moving point P satisfies |frac{PA}{PO}|=2 with two fixed points O(0,0) and A(3,0), let the locus of point P be curve Gamma.

Since |DB| = 2 (radius of the larger circle), we find: [ DN = sqrt{|DB|^{2} - |BN|^{2}} = sqrt{4 - 3} = 1 ] Thus, the locus of N is a circle with equation (x+1)^{2} + y^{2} = 1, centered at (-1,0) with radius 1. - The maximum distance from N to the line AM is the sum of the radii of the two circles, which is 2 + 1 = 3. - Therefore, the maximum area of triangle AMN can be calculated as: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{3} times 3 = 3sqrt{3} ] Hence, the equation of Gamma is boxed{(x+1)^{2} + y^{2} = 4}, and the maximum area of triangle AMN is boxed{3sqrt{3}}."},{"instruction":"What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,4), and (6,10)?","output":"1. **Identifying Base and Height**: The triangle has vertices at (0,0), (0,4), and (6,10).

After a certain period, P withdraws his investment but Q and R continue.

The returns per month for P, Q, and R are in the ratio 7.00001 : 10 : 6. This means that for every unit of time, P gets 7.00001 parts of the profit, Q gets 10 parts, and R gets 6 parts. Since P was active for 5 months, his share of the profit is 5 * 7.00001 parts. R was active for 8 months, so his share is 8 * 6 parts. We need to find out for how many months Q was active, let's call this number of months 'm'. The total profit is 200,000, and P's share is 50,000. Since P's share is a quarter of the total profit, this means that the parts must also reflect this relationship. Therefore, the total parts of profit must be divided into 4 equal shares, where P gets 1 share, and the remaining 3 shares are divided between Q and R according to their parts and the time they were active. P's share in parts is 5 * 7.00001, which is equal to 1 share of the profit in dollars. So, we can write: 5 * 7.00001 = 1 share of profit in parts 1 share of profit in dollars = 50,000 Now, let's find the total parts of profit for Q and R: Q's parts = m * 10 R's parts = 8 * 6 The total parts of profit for Q and R together must be equal to 3 shares of profit in parts (since P took 1 share and the total is 4 shares): Q's parts + R's parts = 3 shares of profit in parts m * 10 + 8 * 6 = 3 * (5 * 7.00001) Now we can solve for m: m * 10 + 48 = 3 * (35.00005) m * 10 + 48 = 105.00015 m * 10 = 105.00015 - 48 m * 10 = 57.00015 m = 57.00015 / 10 m = 5.700015 Since the number of months Q was active must be a whole number, we can round m to the nearest whole number, which is 6 months.

No three points are collinear. 2. Together with any three points of the given set, the orthocenter of the triangle formed by these points also lies within the set. We'll systematically explore the solution:  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define the Points Set**:    Let ( M ) be the given set of points on the plane with the properties stated above. 2. **Convex Hull ( V )**:    Consider the convex hull ( V ) of this set ( M ). ( V ) is a polygon that represents the smallest convex set containing all points in ( M ). 3. **Properties of Vertex Angles**:    The polygon ( V ) cannot have any obtuse angles. To see why, suppose ( A, B, C ) are three consecutive vertices of ( V ), and the angle ( angle ABC ) is obtuse. The orthocenter of triangle ( ABC ) would lie outside the polygon ( V ), which contradicts the requirement that the orthocenter must lie within the set. Therefore, ( V ) is either a right or an acute-angled triangle or a quadrilateral with all angles being right angles i.e., a square. 4. **Case Analysis**:    Let's analyze the sets ( M ) that meet these requirements for different possible shapes of ( V ):        a. **Acute-Angled Triangle**:       - Consider an acute-angled triangle ( Delta ABC ) with orthocenter ( H ).       - The orthocenter ( H ) lies inside ( Delta ABC ).       - Suppose there is an additional point ( K ) inside ( V ) apart from ( A, B, C, ) and ( H ).       - Point ( K ) must lie in one of the sub-triangles ( ABH, BCH, CAH ).        - For example, assuming ( K ) lies inside ( BCH ), we consider the angle properties:         [         angle BAC + angle BHC = 180^circ.         ]       - Since ( K ) lies inside ( BCH ):         [         angle BHC < angle BKC.         ]       - The orthocenter ( L ) of ( Delta BCK ) would then lie outside ( V ), leading to contradiction.           Therefore, other than the vertices ( A, B, C ) and the orthocenter ( H ), no additional point can belong to ( M ).    b. **Right-Angled Triangle**:       - In a right-angled triangle, the orthocenter coincides with the vertex forming the right angle. Therefore, it suffices to consider only the three vertices to form the required set ( M ):         [         M = {A, B, C}.         ]        c. **Square**:       - For a square, the orthocenter of any triangle formed by three of its vertices will also be one of the vertices.       - Therefore, the set ( M ) will consist of the four vertices of the square:         [         M = {A, B, C, D}.         ]  Conclusion: The finite sets of points ( M ) that satisfy the conditions are: 1. The three vertices of an acute-angled triangle and its orthocenter. 2. The three vertices of a right-angled triangle. 3. The four vertices of a square.

Moreover, since ( DA = DC ):     [     triangle DAC quad text{is an equilateral triangle}     ]     This implies ( DA = AC ) and:     [     DA = AC = 2 quad (text{as each side of the triangle is 2})     ] 4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**     Using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangles ( EAC ) and ( EAD ), since ( DA ) and ( DC ) are equal:     [     sqrt{EA^2 + ED^2} = sqrt{EC^2 + ED^2}     ]     Therefore, because ( EA = EC = 2 ):     [     ED = EC = 2     ] 5. **Calculate the Volume:**     The volume ( V ) of the triangular prism ( D-ABC ) can be determined by the formula:     [     V = frac{1}{3} times text{Base Area} times text{Height}     ]     Here the base is a right triangle (triangle ABC) with:     [     text{Base Area} = frac{1}{2} times 2 times 2 = 2     ]     The height ( DE ) is perpendicular to the base and is equal to 2, hence:     [     V = frac{1}{3} times 2 times 2 = frac{4}{3}     ] [ boxed{frac{4}{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"Find all pairs of positive integers ((n, k)), for which there exists a positive integer (s) such that the number of positive divisors of (s n) is equal to the number of positive divisors of (s k).","output":"We aim to identify all positive integer pairs ((n, k)) such that there exists a positive integer (s) for which the number of positive divisors of (sn) equals those of (sk). To proceed with the solution, we shall use the divisor function and the properties of divisors of integers. 1. **Notation and Definitions**:     - Let the number of positive divisors of a positive integer (n) be denoted by (d(n)).    - If (n) is expressed as (n = prod_{i=1}^{t} p_i^{alpha_i}) where (p_1, p_2, cdots, p_t) are distinct prime factors and (alpha_1, alpha_2, cdots, alpha_t) are non-negative integers, then the formula for (d(n)) is:    [    d(n) = prod_{i=1}^{t} (alpha_i + 1)    ] 2. **Condition Analysis**:    To show that if (k mid n) or (n mid k) (but (k neq n)) there does not exist any (s) that satisfies the condition:    - If (n mid k), then for any positive integer (s), the set of positive divisors of (sn) is a proper subset of the set of positive divisors of (sk). Therefore, (d(sn) < d(sk)).    - Similarly, if (k mid n), (d(sn) < d(sk)).    Therefore, in these cases, no such (s) exists, and they do not satisfy the condition. 3. **Prime Factorization and Product**:    Assume (n nmid k) and (k nmid n). Let (n) and (k) have the prime factorizations:    [    n = prod_{i=1}^{t} p_i^{alpha_i}, quad k = prod_{i=1}^{t} p_i^{beta_i}    ]    Here, (alpha_i) and (beta_i) are non-negative integers for (i = 1, 2, cdots, t). 4. **Finding (s)**:    We need to find (s = prod_{i=1}^{t} p_i^{gamma_i}) with (gamma_i ge 0) (non-negative integers) such that:    [    frac{d(sn)}{d(sk)} = prod_{i=1}^{t} frac{alpha_i + gamma_i + 1}{beta_i + gamma_i + 1} = 1    ] 5. **Condition for Equality**:    For the equality to hold, it must be that, for every (i):    - If (alpha_i = beta_i), then the fraction (frac{alpha_i + gamma_i + 1}{beta_i + gamma_i + 1} = 1) holds for any non-negative (gamma_i).    - If (alpha_i neq beta_i), assume without loss of generality (alpha_i > beta_i). Then:      [      frac{alpha_i + gamma_i + 1}{beta_i + gamma_i + 1} = 1 + frac{1}{M}      ]      Let:      [      1 + frac{1}{M} = frac{M + 1}{M} quad Rightarrow quad frac{alpha_i - beta_i}{beta_i + gamma_i + 1} = frac{1}{M}      ]      Therefore:      [      gamma_i = M(alpha_i - beta_i) - (beta_i + 1)      ] 6. **Summarizing Conditions**:    - For (i) such that (alpha_i = beta_i), any non-negative integer (gamma_i) works.    - For (i) such that (alpha_i neq beta_i), we choose (gamma_i) according to the derived expression above. Since the division condition (n nmid k) and (k nmid n) allows us to find such (s) that meets the divisor count equality, the equality holds.

Now, let's calculate how many gnomes remain after the forest owner takes a percentage from each forest. From the Ravenswood forest, the owner takes 40% of the gnomes: 40% of 80 = 0.40 * 80 = 32 gnomes taken. So, the remaining gnomes in Ravenswood forest are: 80 - 32 = 48 gnomes.

Therefore, we have |AF_{2}|=2m and |BF_{1}|=3m based on the given conditions. 2. **Apply the definition of an ellipse**: The total distance from a point on the ellipse to the foci is constant, which means |AF_{1}|+|AF_{2}|=2a.

This happens if the additional Sundays are spread such that they maximally fill different months.      Specifically, the configurations allowing these maximums are:     - In a regular year, 52 Sundays yield a realistic case of **4 months** with an extra Sunday.     - In a leap year with 53 Sundays, there could be as many as **5 months** with an extra Sunday.

Calculate 50% of the total votes to understand the minimum threshold for winning. Since there are 200 students, we have: [200 times 0.5 = 100] This means 100 votes represent exactly 50% of the total votes. 2.

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students: [200 - 120 = 80] So, there are 80 girls in the school. 5.

There are k segments and k-1 turns in total.     2. **Representation of the Lion's Movement:**    Imagine the lion starts by running a segment A A_{1} = I_{1}.

After running segment A_{1} A_{2} = I_{2}, we rotate around A_{2} by angle alpha_{2}, making I_{3} the continuation of I_{2}, and continue this process. 3. **Forming a Straight Line:**    By performing the rotations as described, the lion essentially runs along a straight line segment AA_{k} = 30,000 meters, where A is the starting point, and A_{k} is the ending point after k segments. 4. **Tracking the Arena Center's Movement:**    Let's follow the movement of the arena's center, point O:    - Initially, point O rotates around A_{1} by angle alpha_{1}, then around A_{2} by angle alpha_{2}, and so on.    - Each time the center O rotates, it moves by no more than 10 cdot alpha_{i} meters, since the rotation center (the lion) is within the arena, i.e., within 10 meters of the arena center.    - After all the rotations, the total movement of point O is no more than 10 left(alpha_{1} + alpha_{2} + ldots + alpha_{k-1}right) meters. 5. **Bounding the Movement:**    Given that O A leq 10 meters and O' A_{k} leq 10 meters (where O' is the final position of the arena center), and the lion runs in a straight line AA_{k} = 30,000 meters, it follows that the overall displacement OO' geq 29,980 meters. 6. **Bounding the Sum of Angles:**    Thus, we have:    [    10 left(alpha_{1} + alpha_{2} + ldots + alpha_{k-1}right) geq 29,980    ]    Dividing by 10, we obtain:    [    alpha_{1} + alpha_{2} + ldots + alpha_{k-1} geq 2,998 text{ radians}    ] # Conclusion: Since the sum of all angles the lion turns is not less than 2,998 radians, we conclude: [ boxed{2998 text{ radians}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given an equilateral triangle ABC, point P lies on the line segment AB such that overrightarrow{AP} = λoverrightarrow{AB} where 0 leqslant λ leqslant 1.

The argument of the logarithm must be greater than zero (since the logarithm of a non-positive number is undefined): 4x - 3 > 0. 2. The denominator of the fraction must not be equal to zero (since division by zero is undefined): ln{(4x - 3)} neq 0. **Step 3: Solving the Inequalities** 1. Solving the first inequality, we get x > frac{3}{4}. 2. For the second inequality, we know that the natural logarithm of 1 is zero. Therefore, we set 4x - 3 = 1 and solve for x to find the value that makes the denominator zero: x = 1. Since the logarithm function approaches negative infinity as its input approaches zero from the right, and positive infinity as its input approaches zero from the left, we exclude x=1 from our domain. **Step 4: Determining the Domain** Combining the results from both inequalities, we find that the domain of the function is x > frac{3}{4} and x neq 1. Hence, the domain is the union of two intervals: (frac{3}{4}, 1) and (1, +infty).

The farmer plants two rows per plant bed and he had 14 plant beds for all his plants. How many pumpkin seeds did the farmer plant in each row?","output":"First, let's calculate the total number of rows the farmer has planted for each type of vegetable. For the beans, he has 64 seedlings and plants 8 in a row, so: 64 bean seedlings / 8 seedlings per row = 8 rows of beans For the radishes, he has 48 radishes and plants 6 in a row, so: 48 radishes / 6 radishes per row = 8 rows of radishes Now, we know that the farmer plants two rows per plant bed, and he has 14 plant beds in total. So the total number of rows he can plant is: 14 plant beds * 2 rows per bed = 28 rows We already know he has 8 rows of beans and 8 rows of radishes, so the remaining rows are for the pumpkins: 28 total rows - 8 rows of beans - 8 rows of radishes = 12 rows for pumpkins The farmer has 84 pumpkin seeds to plant in these 12 rows, so: 84 pumpkin seeds / 12 rows = 7 pumpkin seeds per row Therefore, the farmer planted boxed{7}  pumpkin seeds in each row."},{"instruction":"Given a bag containing 3 red balls and 3 white balls, two mutually exclusive but not contradictory events are (　　) A: At least 2 white balls, all red balls B: At least 1 white ball, at least 1 red ball C: At least 2 white balls, at most 1 white ball D: Exactly 1 white ball, exactly 2 red ball","output":"When drawing 3 balls from a bag containing 3 red balls and 3 white balls, the possible outcomes can be: - All 3 balls are red; - 1 red ball and 2 white balls; - 2 red balls and 1 white ball; - All 3 balls are white.

What is the percentage in excess for the first side?","output":"Let's denote the original length of the first side as L and the original length of the second side as W. The true area of the rectangle is A = L * W. Now, let's denote the percentage in excess for the first side as x%. This means that the measured length of the first side is L * (1 + x/100). The second side is measured with a 5% deficit, so the measured length of the second side is W * (1 - 5/100) = W * 0.95. The calculated area from these measurements is A' = L * (1 + x/100) * W * 0.95. The error percentage in the area is given as 8.3%, which means that the calculated area is 8.3% more than the true area. Therefore, we can write the following equation: A' = A * (1 + 8.3/100) = A * 1.083 Substituting the expressions for A and A', we get: L * (1 + x/100) * W * 0.95 = L * W * 1.083 Now, we can divide both sides by L * W to simplify the equation: (1 + x/100) * 0.95 = 1.083 Now, we need to solve for x: 1 + x/100 = 1.083 / 0.95 x/100 = (1.083 / 0.95) - 1 x/100 = 1.13947368421 - 1 x/100 = 0.13947368421 x = 0.13947368421 * 100 x ≈ 13.947368421 Therefore, the percentage in excess for the first side is approximately boxed{13.95%} ."},{"instruction":"Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve.

Local call cost = 45 minutes * 5 cents/minute = 225 cents Now, let's convert the total amount Freddy spent into cents. Total cost in cents = 10 dollars * 100 cents/dollar = 1000 cents Since the total cost includes both the local call to his dad and the international call to his brother, we can subtract the cost of the local call from the total cost to find the cost of the international call. Cost of international call = Total cost - Local call cost Cost of international call = 1000 cents - 225 cents = 775 cents Now, we know that the international call lasted 31 minutes. To find the cost per minute of the international call, we divide the total cost of the international call by the duration of the call.

What is the maximum number of lamps that can be on the road, knowing that if any lamp is turned off, the road will no longer be fully illuminated?  1. **Numbering the Lamps:**    - Label each lamp with a natural number in the order they are positioned along the road. 2. **Condition for Overlap:**    - If the segments illuminated by the (n)-th and ((n+2))-th lamps overlap, then the ((n+1))-th lamp can be turned off.    - Thus, segments illuminated by lamps with different odd numbers do not overlap. 3. **Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Segments:**    - In a 1000 m stretch, it is impossible to place more than 999 non-overlapping 1 m segments.    - Therefore, there must be no more than 999 lamps on odd-numbered positions. 4. **Doubling for Maximum Coverage:**    - Hence, the maximum number of lamps on odd-numbered positions ensures a similar number on even-numbered positions.    - This gives a maximum total of (2 times 999 = 1998) lamps. 5. **Arranging the Lamps:**    - Position 1998 lamps such that the centers of the illuminated segments form an arithmetic progression.    - Let the first term be (0.5) m and the 1998-th term be (999.5) m.    - The distance between the centers of consecutive illuminated segments will be (1/1997) m. 6. **Ensuring Full Illumination:**    - Any small segment between the ((n))-th and ((n+2))-th illuminated segments (a gap of (1/1997) m) is only illuminated by the ((n+1))-th lamp. 7. **Critical Dependency:**    - Consequently, turning off any lamp will result in a gap where the road will not be fully illuminated. # Conclusion: [ boxed{1998} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a circle and a point ( A ) inside it, find the locus of the vertices ( C ) of all possible rectangles ( ABCD ), where points ( B ) and ( D ) lie on the circle.","output":"1. Let ( O ) be the center of the given circle with radius ( R ). We need to show that for any point ( C ), the equality ( O C^2 = 2 R^2 - O A^2 ) holds, where ( A ) is a given point inside the circle, and ( B ) and ( D ) are points on the circle such that ( ABCD ) forms a rectangle. 2. Introduce the coordinates of points as shown in the given diagram (Fig. 118) and consider that the segment ( O C ) forms the hypotenuse in a right triangle with legs ( x ) and ( y ). According to the Pythagorean theorem, we get: [ O C^2 = x^2 + y^2. ] 3. Next, we need to express ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) in terms of ( R ) and ( O A ). By the construction of the rectangle ( ABCD ), and since ( B ) and ( D ) lie on the circle, the following holds: [ x^2 + t^2 = y^2 + z^2 = R^2, quad text{and} quad z^2 + t^2 = O A^2, ] where ( O A ) is the distance from ( O ) to ( A ), points ( t ) and ( z ) are projections for calculation purposes. 4. Combining the above equations, derive: [ O C^2 = x^2 + y^2 = left(x^2 + t^2right) + left(y^2 + z^2right) - left(z^2 + t^2right) = 2R^2 - O A^2. ] 5. Therefore, the distance from the point ( C ) to the center ( O ) is constant and equal to ( sqrt{2 R^2 - O A^2} ). Thus, the locus of point ( C ) is a circle with center ( O ) and radius ( sqrt{2 R^2 - O A^2} ). 6. Conversely, suppose ( C ) is such that ( O C^2 = 2 R^2 - O A^2 ). We need to prove that there exists a rectangle ( ABCD ) where ( B ) and ( D ) lie on the given circle. 7. Construct a circle with diameter ( AC ) (see Fig. 119). This circle will intersect the original circle in two points. Denote one of these intersection points as ( B ). 8. Since ( angle A B C = 90^{circ} ) (refer to Fact 14 ), we complete the rectangle ( ABCD ) as described. To show that ( D ) lies on the original circle, we use the following coordinates and distances: [ begin{aligned} O D^2 &= y^2 + z^2  &= left(x^2 + y^2right) + left(z^2 + t^2right) - left(x^2 + t^2right)  &= O C^2 + O A^2 - R^2  &= left(2 R^2 - O A^2right) + O A^2 - R^2 = R^2. end{aligned} ] 9.

The speed required to cover the same distance in 3/2 times less than the initial time can be calculated as follows: New time = T - (3/2 * T) = T * (1 - 3/2) = T * (-1/2) Since time cannot be negative, we must have made a mistake in our calculation. The phrase \\"3/2th of the previous time\\" means the new time is 3/2 times the original time, not 3/2 times less. So the correct calculation should be: New time = T * (3/2) We are given that the speed required to cover the distance in this new time is 30 kmph.  Using the formula for speed (Speed = Distance / Time), we can set up the equation: 30 kmph = 270 km / (T * (3/2)) Now we can solve for T: 30 = 270 / (3T/2) 30 = 270 * 2 / 3T 30 * 3T = 270 * 2 90T = 540 T = 540 / 90 T = 6 hours So, the car took boxed{6}  hours to cover the distance initially."},{"instruction":"Which of the following sets is empty?

The time taken to row upstream is ( frac{D}{39 - v} ), and the time taken to row downstream is ( frac{D}{39 + v} ). According to the problem, the time taken to row upstream is twice the time taken to row downstream, so we can write the equation: [ frac{D}{39 - v} = 2 times frac{D}{39 + v} ] Since the distance ( D ) is the same for both upstream and downstream, we can cancel it out from both sides of the equation: [ frac{1}{39 - v} = 2 times frac{1}{39 + v} ] Now, we solve for ( v ): [ 1 = 2 times frac{39 - v}{39 + v} ] [ 39 + v = 2(39 - v) ] [ 39 + v = 78 - 2v ] [ 3v = 78 - 39 ] [ 3v = 39 ] [ v = frac{39}{3} ] [ v = 13 ] So, the speed of the stream is boxed{13}  kmph."},{"instruction":"Given f(x)=|xa|+|x+3a2} and g(x)=x^{2}+2ax+1 where ain R.

We are asked to determine if the sequence ( {n_k} ) defined by the recurrence relation ( n_{k+1} = n_k + P(n_k) ) with ( n_1 in mathbb{N} ), can be unbounded. 1. **Analyzing the behavior of ( n_k )**:    Let ( n_k ) be a term in the sequence. We need to examine the growth rate of ( n_k ) as ( k ) increases. For this, consider a large number ( n_k ). The product of its digits, ( P(n_k) ), is typically much smaller than ( n_k ) itself. 2. **Estimating the value of ( P(n_k) )**:    Consider the digits of ( n_k ) and assume ( n_k ) has ( d ) digits. Each digit is at most 9. Hence, if ( n_k ) is in the order of ( 10^{d-1} ), then ( P(n_k) leq 9^d ). Since ( d ) is approximately ( log_{10}(n_k) ), we have:    [ P(n_k) leq 9^{log_{10}(n_k)} ] 3. **Exploring the limiting behavior**:    As ( n_k ) increases, ( log_{10}(n_k) ) also increases. However, the growth rate of ( n_k ) due to the addition of ( P(n_k) ) is not significant enough to cause ( n_k ) to be unbounded. Specifically,    [ n_{k+1} = n_k + P(n_k) ]    Since ( P(n_k) ) grows more slowly than ( n_k ),    [ lim_{k to infty} frac{P(n_k)}{n_k} = 0 ] 4. **Conclusion on stabilization**:    The above implies that there will be a point from which ( n_k ) progresses very slowly, since ( P(n_k) ) becomes relatively negligible compared to ( n_k ). Once ( n_k ) reaches a certain threshold or a specific pattern, the increments ( P(n_k) ) no longer significantly increase ( n_k ). Therefore, there exists a point ( p ) such that for all ( k geq p ), the sequence ( {n_k} ) stabilizes, i.e.,    [ n_p = n_{p+1} = ldots ] Hence, the sequence ({n_k}) cannot be unbounded.

Since the radius is perpendicular to the line, we can use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of the line passing through the center of the circle and being perpendicular to the tangent line: y - 1 = -frac{3}{4}(x - h) Solving for y, we obtain: y = -frac{3}{4}x + frac{3}{4}h + 1 Because the line 4x - 3y = 0 can be rewritten as y=frac{4}{3}x, the point of tangency, let's call it (T_x, T_y), would lie on both lines, i.e., it satisfies: T_y = -frac{3}{4}T_x + frac{3}{4}h + 1 = frac{4}{3}T_x Thus, we can solve for T_x: frac{4}{3}T_x + frac{3}{4}T_x = frac{3}{4}h + 1 frac{25}{12}T_x = frac{3}{4}h + 1 T_x = frac{3}{5}h + frac{4}{5} Since the distance from the center to the point of tangency is the radius, and the radius is 1: sqrt{(T_x - h)^2 + (T_y - 1)^2} = 1 sqrt{(frac{3}{5}h + frac{4}{5} - h)^2 + (frac{4}{3}(frac{3}{5}h + frac{4}{5}) - 1)^2} = 1 Squaring both sides to remove the square root gives us: left(frac{3}{5}h + frac{4}{5} - hright)^2 + left(frac{4}{3}(frac{3}{5}h + frac{4}{5}) - 1right)^2 = 1 Simplify and solve the equation to find h. After simplifying, we find that h=2. Therefore, the center of the circle is (2,1) and the radius is 1. The standard equation of a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. Thus, the standard equation of the circle is: boxed{(x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1}"},{"instruction":"Last year, a bicycle cost 200 and a cycling helmet 50.

Draw the three diagonals that pass through the center of the hexagon. These diagonals divide the hexagon into 6 congruent equilateral triangles. Let the area of the hexagon be ( A ). Therefore, the area of each equilateral triangle is ( frac{A}{6} ). 2. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle:**    Given 7 points inside or on the hexagon, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these 6 equilateral triangles must contain at least 2 of the 7 points.

We begin by demonstrating that a homography preserves the cross-ratio.     A standard form of a complex projective transformation (homography) is given by:     [     f(z) = frac{a z + b}{c z + d}     ]     where ( a, b, c, d ) are complex numbers. To understand the structure of this transformation, we rewrite it as:     [     f(z) = frac{a z + b}{c z + d} = frac{b - frac{a d}{c}}{c z + d} + frac{a}{c} = frac{alpha}{c z + d} + beta     ]     This indicates that ( f ) can be decomposed into the following steps:     - A direct similarity ( z mapsto cz + d )     - An involution ( z mapsto frac{1}{z} )     - Another direct similarity ( z mapsto alpha z + beta )     Because all these transformations preserve the cross-ratio, ( f ) as their composition, also preserves the cross-ratio. 2. **Normalization and Simplification:**     Next, we remark that multiplying all constants ( a, b, c, d ) by a scalar does not change the function; hence, we can assume without loss of generality that ( d = 1 ). Therefore, the transformation is simplified to:     [     f(z) = frac{az + b}{cz + 1}     ]     To find the specific transformation that maps given points ( A, B, C ) to new points ( A', B', C' ), we set up the system:     [     f(a) = a', quad f(b) = b', quad f(c) = c'     ]     Solving this system yields a set of three linear equations with three unknowns, which typically has a unique solution (except in special cases like ( a' = b' )). Thus, function ( f ) is the unique function that maps ( A, B, C ) to ( A', B', C' ) while preserving the cross-ratio. 3. **Finding the Fixed Points:**         A fixed point of the projective transformation satisfies:     [     frac{az + b}{cz + d} = z     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     az + b = z(cz + d)     ]     Rearranging the terms:     [     az + b = cz^2 + dz     ]     This transforms into the quadratic equation:     [     cz^2 + (d - a)z - b = 0     ]     A quadratic equation of the form ( Az^2 + Bz + C = 0 ) always has two solutions (which might coincide if it has a double root). Therefore, the projective transformation ( f(z) ) always has two fixed points in the complex plane. # Conclusion: The form of a complex projective transformation is ( f(z) = frac{az + b}{cz + d} ) with ( a, b, c, d ) being complex numbers, and such a transformation always has two fixed points.

Prove that there exist three points that form a triangle with an area of at least 3.","output":"1. **Define the Points**: Let the points on the plane be denoted by ( A, B, C, X, ) and ( Y ). 2. **Maximum Area Triangle**: Assume that the triangle ( triangle ABC ) has the largest area, denoted by ( S ), among all triangles formed by any three of the five points. 3. **Establishing the Goal**: We need to show that there exist three points among ( A, B, C, X, ) and ( Y ) such that the area of the triangle they form is at least 3. 4. **Bounding the Areas**: Suppose, for contradiction, that the area of every triangle formed by any three of the points is strictly between ( frac{2}{3}S ) and ( S ). 5. **Analyze Triangles Involving ( X )**: For the triangles ( triangle ABX, triangle BCX, triangle CAX ), this condition implies that the point ( X ) must lie in one of the smaller triangles outside ( triangle ABC ) created by dividing ( triangle ABC ) into three smaller triangles with one vertex at ( X ). Let's denote these smaller triangles as ( triangle A_1B_1C_1, triangle A_2B_2C_2, ) and ( triangle A_3B_3C_3 ). 6. **Placing ( X ) and ( Y )**: Similarly, the point ( Y ) must also lie in one of these smaller triangles outside ( triangle ABC ). Assume, without loss of generality, that both ( X ) and ( Y ) are in ( triangle A_3B_3C_3 ). This would imply that the triangles ( triangle AXY ) and ( triangle BXY ) have areas not exceeding ( frac{1}{3}S ) because ( triangle AXY ) and ( triangle BXY ) are contained in ( triangle AA_3C_3 ) and ( triangle BB_3C_3 ), respectively, each having area exactly ( frac{1}{3}S ). 7. **Contradiction Refinement**: If ( X ) and ( Y ) do not lie in the same smaller triangle but in different smaller triangles (for instance, ( X ) in ( triangle A_1B_1C_1 ) and ( Y ) in ( triangle A_2B_2C_2 )), then the triangle ( triangle XCY ) has an area strictly less than ( frac{2}{3}S ). However, if we reflect ( X ) or ( Y ) relative to ( C ), the area of ( triangle XCY ) would not change, and it would lie within a quadrilateral formed by points such as ( C, C_1, A_1, D ) where ( D ) is the corresponding reflected point. The area of this quadrilateral is equal to ( frac{2}{3}S ). 8. **Conclusion**: By the condition that every triangle formed by any three points has an area of at least 2, and considering that the maximum area triangle ( triangle ABC ) cannot be the limiting factor without violating the initial assumptions, there must exist a triangle among the points ( A, B, C, X, ) and ( Y ) with an area of at least 3.

When points (B_1) and (C_1) coincide with (B) and (C), the inequality ( left| A C_1 right| v + left| A B_1 right| w leq left| B_1 C_1 right| x ) becomes ( b v + c w leq a x ). 2. **Summing the Inequalities:** Repeat this for each pair of sides, and sum up the resulting inequalities: [ begin{align*} a x &geq b v + c w,  b y &geq a w + c u,  c z &geq a u + b v. end{align*} ] Adding them up: [ a x + b y + c z geq b v + c w + a w + c u + a u + b v. ] 3. **Simplifying:** Since the sum of the areas of parallelograms built on different segments equals (4S): [ a x + b y + c z geq 4 S. ] (boxed{a x + b y + c z geq 4 S}) **Part (b): Prove the inequality** ( x + y + z geq 2(u + v + w) ). 1. **Considering the Points ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ):** If ( left|A B_1right| = left|A Cright| ) and ( left|A C_1right| = left|A Bright| ), the inequality ( left| A C_1 right| v + left| A B_1 right| w leq left| B_1 C_1 right| x ) gives ( c v + b w leq a x ). This converts to: [ x geq frac{c}{a} v + frac{b}{a} w. ] 2. **Applying Analogous Results:** Applying similar transformations for ( y ) and ( z ): [ y geq frac{a}{b} u + frac{c}{b} w, quad z geq frac{a}{c} u + frac{b}{c} v. ] 3. **Summing the Inequalities:** Summing these yields: [ x + y + z geq left( frac{c}{a} + frac{a}{c} right) v + left( frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b} right) w + left( frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{b} right) u. ] Since ( frac{c}{a} + frac{a}{c} + frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{b} geq 6): [ x + y + z geq 2(u + v + w) quad (text{by the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality}). ] (boxed{x + y + z geq 2(u + v + w)}) **Part (c): Prove the inequality** ( x u + y v + z w geq 2(u v + v w + w u) ). 1. **Using Previous Results:** From Part (a), we have: [ a x geq b v + c w implies x u geq frac{b}{a} u v + frac{c}{a} w u. ] Similarly: [ y v geq left(frac{a}{b}right) u v + left(frac{c}{b}right) w v, ] [ z w geq left(frac{a}{c}right) u w + left(frac{b}{c}right) v w. ] 2. **Summing the Inequalities:** Summing these results gives: [ x u + y v + z w geq left( frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} right) u v + left( frac{b}{c} + frac{c}{b} right) v w + left( frac{a}{c} + frac{c}{a} right) w u. ] By the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality: [ left( frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} right) + left( frac{b}{c} + frac{c}{b} right) + left( frac{a}{c} + frac{c}{a} right) geq 6. ] So: [ x u + y v + z w geq 2(u v + v w + w u). ] (boxed{x u + y v + z w geq 2(u v + v w + w u)}) **Part (d): Prove the inequality** (2left(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z}right) leq frac{1}{u} + frac{1}{v} + frac{1}{w}). 1. **Projection Points:** Denote projections of (M) on the sides (BC), (CA), and (AB) by (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1) respectively.  2. **Constructing (A^prime), (B^prime), (C^prime):** Consider the points (A^prime), (B^prime), (C^prime) on the rays (MA), (MB), and (MC) such that (|MA|cdot|MA^prime| = |MB|cdot|MB^prime| = |MC|cdot|MC^prime|). 3. **Using Inequality from Part (b):** From Part (b): [ x + y + z geq 2(u + v + w). ] 4. **Taking Inverses and Summing Up:** Thus, the sum ( frac{1}{u} + frac{1}{v} + frac{1}{w} ) meets the condition with: [ 2left(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z}right) leq frac{1}{u} + frac{1}{v} + frac{1}{w}. ] (boxed{2left(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z}right) leq frac{1}{u} + frac{1}{v} + frac{1}{w}}) **Part (e): Prove the inequality** (xy z geq frac{R}{2r}(u+v)(v+w)(w+u)). 1. **Taking Special Points:** Taking (B_1 = C_1 = l), then: [ a_1 = 2 l sin frac{A}{2}. ] From the definition: [ x geq frac{1}{2 sin frac{A} {2}} (u + v). ] 2. **Applying Similar Results:** For (y) and (z): [ y geq frac{1}{2 sin frac{B}{2}} (u + w), ] [ z geq frac{1}{2 sin frac{C}{2}} (v + w). ] 3. **Multiplying the Inequalities:** Multiplying these: [ x y z geq frac{1}{8 sin frac{A}{2} sin frac{B}{2} sin frac{C}{2}} (u + v)(v + w)(w + u). ] Substituting the trigonometric identity: [ 8 sin frac{A}{2} sin frac{B}{2} sin frac{C}{2} = frac{r}{R}, ] It yields: [ xy z geq frac{R}{2r} (u+v)(v+w)(w+u). ] (boxed{xy z geq frac{R}{2r} (u+v)(v+w)(w+u)}) **Part (f): Prove the inequality** ( xy z geq frac{4 R}{r} u v w ). 1. **From Previous Results:** From Part (e): [ xy z geq frac{R}{2r} times 2sqrt{uv} times 2sqrt{vw} times 2sqrt{wu}. ] 2. **Simplification Using Identity:** It yields: [ xy z geq frac{4R}{r} uvw. ] (boxed{xy z geq frac{4 R}{r} uv w}) **Part (g): Prove the inequality** ( xy + yz + zx geq frac{2R}{r}(uv + vw + wu) ). 1. **Combining Inequalities:** Divide the inequalities derived in parts (c) and (f): ( xy z geq frac{4 R}{r} uv w ), ( 2left(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z}right) leq frac{1}{u} + frac{1}{v} + frac{1}{w}. ) From this, we can derive: ( xy + yz + zx geq frac{2R}{r}(uv + vw + wu). ) (boxed{xy + yz + zx geq frac{2 R}{r} (uv + vw + wu)}) That's a comprehensive breakdown of the steps involved in proving each of the inequalities given in the problem."},{"instruction":"The slope of the line passing through points (M(2,1)) and (N(1,3)) is __________.","output":"**Analysis** This question tests the formula for the slope of a line.

Given that the line passes through (3,-2) and has equal absolute intercepts, the slope m is the negative ratio of the y-intercept to the x-intercept. Since the intercepts are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, m = -frac{y}{x} = -frac{2}{3}. Thus, the equation becomes y = -frac{2}{3}x. Rearranging this equation gives 2x + 3y = 0. **Case 2: Intercept is not 0** Let the equation of line l be frac{x}{a}+frac{y}{b}=1, where a and b are the x and y intercepts, respectively.

We are given that alpha + beta + gamma = 2pi (the angle sum around a point). 2. **Sequence of Rotations**: Perform the following rotations:     - Rotate the plane around point K by angle alpha.     - Rotate the plane around point L by angle beta.     - Rotate the plane around point M by angle gamma. 3. **Net Transformation**:     - Since alpha + beta + gamma = 2pi, the combined effect of these three rotations will be a full rotation (or identity transformation). This implies that the final positioning of the plane is identical to the initial positioning with no net rotation. 4. **Fixed Point Argument**:      Since a full rotation of 2pi (or 360^circ) leaves the entire plane unchanged, the configuration of our triangles and their respective constructions suggest that the initial and final positions of any point on the plane coincide. 5. **Center of the Third Rotation**:      The center of the third rotation (point M) must coincide with the center of the rotation resulting from the sequential application of the first two rotations around K and L. This implies that M can be found by determining the center resulting from combining the rotations about K and L. 6. **Application of Problem II.300**:     Using the results from problem II.300, we know that the construction of these rotations and their centers ensures that the incenter or excenter of the resultant configuration (depending on the rotations being internal or external) will fix these points. 7. **Step-by-step Verification**:      - Rotations around K, L, and M will map the initial triangle ABC to itself since the total rotation angle sums to 2pi.     - Each successive rotation halves the angles at K, L, and M in our configuration for triangle KLM.     - Hence, the angles of triangle KLM are frac{alpha}{2}, frac{beta}{2}, and frac{gamma}{2} respectively. # Conclusion Therefore, the angles of triangle KLM are indeed frac{alpha}{2}, frac{beta}{2}, and frac{gamma}{2}, as required. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The average monthly income of a family of 4 earning members was Rs. 735.

We have a mathematical competition divided into I and II parts with a total of 28 problems. Each participant solves exactly 7 problems, and every pair of problems is solved by exactly two participants. We need to prove that there exists a participant who either solves no problems in part I or solves at least 4 problems in part I. 1. **Finding the number of participants**:     - Total number of problems = 28.     - Each participant solves exactly 7 problems.     - Each pair of problems is solved by exactly two participants.        Let ( n ) be the number of participants. Since every participant solves 7 problems, each of them covers ( binom{7}{2} = 21 ) pairs of problems. Therefore, the total number of problem pairs covered by all participants is ( 21n ).     We also know that there are 28 problems, so the total number of distinct problem pairs is ( binom{28}{2} = 378 ). Since each problem pair is solved by exactly 2 participants, the total number of pairs participants cover is ( 2 times 378 = 756 ).     Equating the two expressions for the total number of pairs covered:     [     21n = 756     ]     Solving for ( n ):     [     n = frac{756}{21} = 36     ]     Hence, there are 36 participants. 2. **Contradiction approach**:     - Suppose each participant in part I solves exactly 1, 2, or 3 problems.     - Let ( m ) be the number of problems in part I.     - Let ( x, y, ) and ( z ) be the number of participants who solve 1, 2, and 3 problems respectively in part I:       [       x + y + z = 36 quad text{(1)}       ] 3. **Regarding overall solutions**:     - Each pair of participants solves a total of 54 problems as each problem appears in ( m ) pairs:       [       x + 2y + 3z = 9m quad text{(2)}       ] 4. **Double counting the problem pairs**:     - Each problem in part I is solved by 2 participants:       [       y + 3z = 2binom{m}{2} = m(m-1) quad text{(3)}       ] 5. **Combining and solving the equations:**     From (1) and (2), we have:     [     x + y + z = 36     ]     [     x + 2y + 3z = 9m     ]     Subtracting the first equation from the second:     [     (2y + 3z) - (y + z) = 9m - 36     ]     [     y + 2z = 9m - 36 quad text{(4)}     ]     Substituting (4) into (3):     [     (9m - 36) + z = m(m - 1)     ]     Simplifying further:     [     z = m(m - 1) - 9m + 36     ]     Substituting ( x = 36 - y - z ):     [     x + y + z = 36 Rightarrow x + (9m - 36 - 2z) + z = 36      ]     [     x = 36 - 9m + 36 + z - z     ]     [     x = 72 - 9m     ] 6. **Contradiction**:     Solving the simplified expression above, it inevitably leads to a negative ( y ) or ( z ), which is impossible for non-negative integer counts. Thus, this contradicts the initial assumption that participants solve 1, 2, or 3 problems in part I. Conclusion: Therefore, there must be at least one participant who did not solve any problem from part I, or solved at least 4 problems from part I.

For this inequality to hold true for all x in R, the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation must be less than or equal to zero. The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac.

Then: [ k+4 = sp^2 + 8 ]    Substituting back, we get: [ 2p^2(p^2) - p^2 + 16 = (sp^2 + 4)(sp^2 + 4) ] [ p^2(2p^2 - 1) = sp^2(sp^2 + 8) ]    Simplifying, we obtain: [ (s^2 - 2)p^2 = -8s - 1 ]    The right side is negative.

Suppose ( p^2 mid k+4 ). Let ( k+4 = sp^2 ). Then: [ k-4 = sp^2 - 8 ]    Using the same logic, this yields a similar contradiction because: 8. For ( s geq 3 ), [ (s^2 - 2)p^2 > s^2(9(p-2)) ]    leads to: [ (8s-1) + (37s - 89) geq (8s-1) + (111 - 89) > 8s-1 ]    leads to a contradiction. 9. Thus, ( p = 3 ) is the only solution.

The speed of the train can be calculated using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time When the train crosses the tree, the distance covered is equal to the length of the train, which is 1500 meters. The time taken to cross the tree is 120 seconds. So, the speed of the train is: Speed = 1500 meters / 120 seconds = 12.5 meters/second Now, when the train crosses the platform, it takes 160 seconds. The distance covered when crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the platform as P meters. So, the total distance covered when crossing the platform is: Distance = Length of train + Length of platform = 1500 meters + P meters We know the speed of the train is 12.5 meters/second, and the time taken to cross the platform is 160 seconds. Using the speed formula again: Speed = Distance / Time 12.5 meters/second = (1500 meters + P meters) / 160 seconds Now, we can solve for P: 12.5 meters/second * 160 seconds = 1500 meters + P meters 2000 meters = 1500 meters + P meters Subtract 1500 meters from both sides: 2000 meters - 1500 meters = P meters P = 500 meters Therefore, the length of the platform is boxed{500}  meters."},{"instruction":"Compute the largest integer k such that 2004^k divides 2004!.","output":"To compute the largest integer k such that 2004^k divides 2004!, we first express 2004 in terms of its prime factorization.

Let's denote the coordinates of M as (x_M, y_M), where M is on the hyperbola and MF_1 is perpendicular to the x-axis. Because MF_1 is perpendicular to the x-axis, y_M must equal the y-coordinate of F_1. For hyperbola frac {x^{2}}{a^2}- frac {y^{2}}{b^2}=1, the foci are located at (pmsqrt{a^2+b^2},0). From the given hyperbola, we can deduce that a^2 = 6 and b^2 = 3, so the distance between the center and each focus (half the distance F_1F_2) is sqrt{a^2+b^2}=sqrt{6+3}=sqrt{9}=3. Hence, the coordinates of F_1 and F_2 are (-3,0) and (3,0), respectively. With MF_1 perpendicular to the x-axis, the coordinates of M must be of the form (3, y_M).

This doesn't restrict the generality of the problem because the roles of ( m ) and ( n ) can be swapped if ( m < n ). 2. **Subtract the two quantities:** Given the divisibility conditions: [ m n mid 3^{m} + 1 quad text{and} quad m n mid 3^{n} + 1, ] we subtract the second from the first: [ m n mid (3^{m} + 1) - (3^{n} + 1). ] 3. **Simplify the expression:** This simplifies to: [ m n mid 3^{m} - 3^{n}. ] 4. **Factor out the common term:** Factor 3 to the lower power ( n ): [ m n mid 3^n (3^{m-n} - 1). ] 5. **Use the fact that ( m n ) and 3 are coprime:** Since ( m n wedge 3 = 1 ) (i.e., ( m n ) is coprime with 3), it must divide the second factor: [ m n mid 3^{m-n} - 1. ] 6. **Consider dividing further:** Next, we also have the initial condition: [ m n mid 3^n + 1. ] Combining these, we infer a recurring property by applying the Euclidean algorithm on ( m ) and ( n ): [ m n mid 3^{|m-2n|} + 1. ] Continuing this process, we will eventually reduce to: [ m n mid 3^d pm 1, ] where ( d ) is the greatest common divisor (gcd(m, n)). 7. **Determine the order of 3 modulo some prime:** Let ( p ) be a minimal prime divisor of ( d ). Then the order of 3 modulo ( p ) must divide ( p-1 ) and ( 2d ). Hence, ( 3^{2d} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). This constrains the order to be either 1 or 2.

The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set. First, let's find the prime factorization of each number: - 25 = 5^2 - 35 = 5 x 7 - 45 = 3^2 x 5 - 15 = 3 x 5 Now, we find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of any of the numbers: - The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 45). - The highest power of 5 is 5^2 (from 25). - The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 35). So, the LCM is 3^2 x 5^2 x 7 = 9 x 25 x 7 = 225 x 7 = 1575. However, we are looking for the smallest six-digit number, and 1575 is only a four-digit number. To find the smallest six-digit number that is a multiple of 1575, we need to find the smallest six-digit number that is divisible by 1575. The smallest six-digit number is 100,000.

The side length of this square can be calculated using the properties of the square and the circle. 4. The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 2. Let ( s ) be the side length of the square. By the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal of the square is given by:    [    text{Diagonal} = ssqrt{2}    ] 5.

This means we are looking for the order of ( a ) modulo ( 2^{2000} ). The order of ( a ) modulo ( 2^{2000} ) is the smallest integer ( n ) such that ( a^n equiv 1 pmod{2^{2000}} ). 2. **Using Euler's Theorem:**    By Euler's theorem, if ( gcd(a, 2^{2000}) = 1 ), then ( a^{varphi(2^{2000})} equiv 1 pmod{2^{2000}} ), where ( varphi ) is the Euler's totient function.

B can finish the work in 15 days, so B's work rate is ( frac{1}{15} ) of the work per day. When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: ( frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{15} = frac{3}{30} + frac{2}{30} = frac{5}{30} = frac{1}{6} ) of the work per day. This means that together, A and B can finish the work in 6 days. Now, let's calculate the share of the total wages that A should get based on the amount of work A does compared to the total work done by A and B together. The ratio of A's work rate to the combined work rate is: ( frac{frac{1}{10}}{frac{1}{6}} = frac{6}{10} = frac{3}{5} ) This means A does ( frac{3}{5} ) of the work when working with B. If A gets Rs. 1800 for doing ( frac{3}{5} ) of the work, then the total wages (W) for the entire work can be calculated by setting up the proportion: ( frac{3}{5} ) of W = Rs. 1800 Now, solve for W: ( W = frac{Rs. 1800}{frac{3}{5}} ) ( W = Rs. 1800 times frac{5}{3} ) ( W = Rs. 3000 ) So, the total wages for the work is Rs. boxed{3000} ."},{"instruction":"100 students appeared in 2 tests. 60 students passed the 1st test, 40 students passed in the 2nd test, and 20 students passed in both tests.

Let x be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, and let r be the number of rows. We are told that when the director arranges them in this way, he has two members left over. This can be represented by the equation: [rx + 2 = m] where m is the total number of band members. Next, we are told that if the director increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. This gives us another equation: [(r-2)(x+1) = m] Setting these two equations equal to each other, we find: [rx + 2 = (r-2)(x+1)] Expanding the right side and simplifying, we get: [rx + 2 = rx + r - 2x - 2] Rearranging terms to solve for r in terms of x, we obtain: [4 = r - 2x] Given that the band has less than 100 members, we know that rx < 98.

Similarly, the circle with diameter ( AB ) will be denoted as ( Gamma_{C} ), which intersects the height from ( C ) at points ( M ) and ( N ). 2. **Notation Introduction**:    Let ( H ) be the orthocenter of the triangle ( ABC ), and let ( H_A ) be the foot of the perpendicular from ( A ) to ( BC ). 3. **Reflect On Circle Properties**:    Note that the circle ( Gamma_{B} ) (with diameter ( AC )) passes through the feet of heights from ( A ) and ( C ). Similarly, the circle ( Gamma_{C} ) (with diameter ( AB )) passes through the feet of heights from ( A ) and ( B ).  4. **Power of a Point**:    Let’s calculate the power of the orthocenter ( H ) with respect to both circles. 5. **For Circle (Gamma_{B})**:    - The power of ( H ) with respect to circle ( Gamma_{B} ) is given by the product of the lengths of the segments formed by ( H )'s cords with the circle.    - Thus, we have ( mathcal{P}_{Gamma_{B}}(H) = HK cdot HL ).    Since ( H ) is the orthocenter, ( H ) lies on the altitude from ( A ). The length ( HH_A ) is therefore a segment from ( H ) to the foot of the altitude from ( A ). Additionally, the power can be expressed using this altitude intersect point:        HK cdot HL = HA cdot HH_A.       6. **For Circle (Gamma_{C})**:    - Similarly, the power of ( H ) with respect to circle ( Gamma_{C} ) will involve the product of the chords from ( H ):    - Therefore,        mathcal{P}_{Gamma_{C}}(H) = HM cdot HN.

Set N consists of elements x that satisfy 4x>4, which simplifies to x>1, indicating that x is any real number greater than 1. Now, to find the intersection Mcap N, we need the common elements of M and N. Since N includes x values greater than 1, we need to evaluate the function y=lg(x^2+1) for those x values. For any x>1, we have x^2+1>1 and thus lg(x^2+1)>0. As x increases, x^2+1 increases as well, and so does y=lg(x^2+1). This means that as x spans the interval (1, +infty), the corresponding y values will span the interval (0, +infty), as the log function is increasing and unbounded for positive x values greater than 1. Given that set M has y values starting from 0 and increasing without bound, and set N corresponds to y values strictly greater than 0, the intersection of M and N will consist of all y values strictly greater than 0, but less than or equal to any finite upper bound on N.

Since there are 10 scores, the median a is the average of the 5^{text{th}} and 6^{text{th}} scores:   a = frac{90 + 90}{2} = 90. **For Eighth Grade:** - **Mean (b):**   To find the mean, we add all the scores and divide by the number of scores:   b = frac{85 + 85 + 95 + 80 + 95 + 90 + 90 + 90 + 100 + 90}{10} = frac{900}{10} = 90. - **Mode (c):**   The score that appears most frequently in the eighth grade is 90, so c = 90. Therefore, the answers are:   a = boxed{90}, b = boxed{90}, c = boxed{90}.  Part 2: Comparison of Student Scores Between Grades To determine which grade has better student scores, we consider the mean, median, mode, and variance of the scores: - **Median and Mode:**   Both grades have the same median (90) and mode (90 for the seventh grade and 90 for the eighth grade). - **Mean:**   The mean score of the eighth grade (90) is higher than that of the seventh grade (89). - **Variance:**   The variance of the eighth grade scores (30) is lower than that of the seventh grade (39), indicating more stability in the scores of the eighth grade. **Conclusion:**   Considering the higher mean and lower variance, the eighth grade students have better scores overall. The scores are not only higher on average but also more consistent.

Since A has a start of 100 m, A only needs to run 500 m to finish the race, while B has to run the full 600 m. A wins by 200 m, which means when A finishes the race, B is 200 m behind. Therefore, B has run 400 m by the time A has run 500 m. The time taken by A to run 500 m is the same as the time taken by B to run 400 m. We can express this as: [ frac{500}{v_A} = frac{400}{v_B} ] Now, we can find the ratio of their speeds by cross-multiplying: [ 500v_B = 400v_A ] Divide both sides by 500: [ v_B = frac{400}{500}v_A ] Simplify the fraction: [ v_B = frac{4}{5}v_A ] Now, we can express the ratio of the speeds of A to B as: [ frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{5}{4} ] So, the ratio of the speeds of A to B is boxed{5:4} ."},{"instruction":"Four coplanar circles are arranged such that no two are concentric.

The work rate is the fraction of work they can complete in one day. A can complete the work in 6 days, so A_rate = 1/6 (work per day). C can complete the work in 7.5 days, so C_rate = 1/7.5 (work per day). Let's denote the number of days B needs to complete the work alone as B_days. Therefore, B_rate = 1/B_days (work per day). When A, B, and C work together, they complete the work in 2 days. The combined work rate of A, B, and C when working together is 1/2 (work per day). The combined work rate of A, B, and C is the sum of their individual work rates: A_rate + B_rate + C_rate = 1/2 Substituting the known rates: 1/6 + 1/B_days + 1/7.5 = 1/2 To solve for B_days, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

How can at least one genuine coin be found with the minimum number of weighings?","output":"To find at least one genuine coin among five coins (3 genuine and 2 counterfeit), we can use two weighings to achieve this. Follow the steps below for a detailed solution: 1. **Initial Setup**: Label the five coins as A, B, C, D, and E. 2. **First Weighing**:    - Weigh coins A and B against each other on a balance scale. 3. **Analysis of First Weighing**:    - **Case 1: Balance is Equal**: This means A and B are either both genuine or both counterfeit. Proceed to the next weighing step.    - **Case 2: Balance is Unequal**: This indicates that one of A or B is counterfeit. Again, proceed to the next weighing step. 4. **Second Weighing**:    - In both cases of first weighing (whether balance is equal or unequal), weigh coins C and D against each other. 5. **Analysis of Second Weighing**:    - **Case 1: First Wheighing Equal**:      - **Equal Balance in Second Weighing**: If C and D balance, this means C and D are both genuine or both counterfeit. Since A and B were equal and C and D are equal, coin E must be genuine. Therefore, E is a genuine coin.      - **Unequal Balance in Second Weighing**: If C and D are unequal, one of them is counterfeit. Since A and B were equal and did not identify as counterfeit, coin E must be genuine.    - **Case 2: First Wheighing Unequal**:      - **Equal Balance in Second Weighing**: If C and D balance, coin E must be genuine, because the unequal balance of A and B identifies one of them as counterfeit.      - **Unequal Balance in Second Weighing**: If C and D are unequal, similar logic to above applies. Coin E must be genuine. Conclusion: Weighing coins A and B against each other followed by weighing coins C and D against each other will help in determining at least one genuine coin through at most two weighings using the balance scale. The genuine coin will either be one of A,B,C, or D if their weighings are equal, or coin E if any imbalance is detected.

A participant wins if at least one number on their ticket matches the number on the base ticket in the same position. What is the minimum number of tickets a participant should fill out to ensure that at least one of their tickets will have at least one match with the base ticket?","output":"1. **Setting Up the Problem:**     Consider there are 50 slots on a lottery ticket where each participant must fill each slot with a unique number from 1 to 50.          The objective is for a participant to ensure that at least one of their tickets matches the sequence on the host's ticket in at least one position. 2. **Constructing the Ticket Entries:**     Let's construct 26 tickets such that:     [     begin{array}{l}     1, 2, 3, ldots, 25, 26, 27, ldots, 50,      2, 3, 4, ldots, 26, 1, 27, ldots, 50,      3, 4, 5, ldots, 1, 2, 27, ldots, 50,      ldots quad ldots quad ldots      25, 26, 1, ldots, 23, 24, 27, ldots, 50,      26, 1, 2, ldots, 24, 25, 27, ldots, 50     end{array}     ]     In these tickets, the first 26 natural numbers are rotated, while the last 24 numbers remain unchanged. 3. **Ensuring a Match:**     On the host's ticket, among the numbers 1, 2, ldots, 26, there must be one that appears in the first 26 positions. Thus, at least one ticket out of these 26 must have one number in the same position as the host's ticket.     This ensures that at least one ticket will match the host ticket at some position, ensuring that at least one is a winning ticket. 4. **Verification with Fewer Tickets:**     Now consider if it is possible to ensure a win with just 25 tickets. Assume we use only 25 tickets and attempt to place the numbers 1, 2, ldots, 25 appropriately so that none of them share the same position with any of the numbers in the 25 formed tickets. 5. **Constructing an Unmatchable Ticket:**     Imagine the host's ticket and another empty ticket. Place the number 1 in an available position that does not match any of the 25 formed tickets' number 1 slots. Continue in this way for 2, 3, ldots, until an impasse.      If one cannot place a number 'a' (where 25 < a leq 50) because at least 25 slots have already been used, this means there are 50 total slots minus the used 25 slots, which leads to:     - Filling each of the remaining slots without matching numbers with the previously formed 25 tickets. 6. **Contradiction Leading to Proof:**     If a number cannot be placed, then a contradiction arises since we are placing 25 different numbers across 26 potential slots in a manner that does not allow any to match up. This implies that it is impossible to use only 25 tickets to ensure a win. If one of these steps fails, it means we must use all numbers (1 through 50) between previously used slots and new ones, filling all positions uniquely. **Conclusion:** To guarantee at least one winning ticket, a participant must fill in at least **26 tickets**. boxed{26}"},{"instruction":"The population of a fictional country in 2010 was 300,000,000.

There are binom{14}{2} ways to select two vertices of magnitude sqrt{3} out of 14 choices. The arguments of those vertices are simply pm frac{pi}{2}, so P_1 has an argument that is a multiple of pi.

After this, Yaroslav calculated the product of the numbers at the vertices of each face of the cube.

Thus, there are 8 vertices, each having a value from the set ({1, -1}). 2. **Product Computation for Each Face**:    Yarislav computes the product of the numbers at the vertices for each of the 6 faces of the cube. 3. **Observation on the Product Properties**:    Each face of the cube consists of 4 vertices. If the product of these 4 vertices is evaluated, it is clear that the product of numbers on each face will either be (1) or (-1). 4. **Understanding Summation Properties**:    Let's denote the sum of the values at the vertices as (S_v):    [    S_v = sum_{i=1}^8 v_i quad text{where} quad v_i in {1, -1}    ]    Similarly, let the sum of the products for each face be denoted as (S_f):    [    S_f = sum_{i=1}^6 f_i quad text{where} quad f_i in {1, -1}    ] 5. **Product of All 14 Terms**:    To understand the product of all these numbers, observe the following:    - Each vertex contributes to 4 different faces, meaning each vertex value is counted 4 times in the face products.    The product of all 14 terms (8 vertices and 6 face products) can thus be expressed as:    [    bigg( prod_{i=1}^8 v_i bigg) times bigg( prod_{j=1}^6 f_j bigg)     ]    Given that each face product (f_i) is the product of 4 vertices:    [    prod_{j=1}^6 f_j = left( prod_{i=1}^8 v_i right)^4    ]    Therefore,    [    bigg( prod_{i=1}^8 v_i bigg)^5    ] 6. **Nature of the Product**:    Since (prod_{i=1}^8 v_i) is either (1) or (-1):    [    left( prod_{i=1}^8 v_i right)^4 = 1    ]    This indicates that the overall product is positive. So, (left( prod_{i=1}^8 v_i right)^5) is also positive. 7. **Count of (-1)**:    The above implies that the count of (-1) in the 14 numbers must be even. This outcome ensures the product is positive. 8. **Summing Conditions**:    To further assess whether    [    S_v + S_f = 0    ]    is possible, note that:    - The sum (S_v) ranges from (-8) to (8) in steps of (2) (even), and (S_f) ranges from (-6) to (6) in steps of (2) (even).    For (S_v + S_f) to be (0), (S_v) and (S_f) must be opposites of each other with an even pair sum. 9. **Impossibility**:    The problem constraints imply that the counts must align perfectly with summation rules. Since an alignment meeting all criteria, specifically achieving (0) while maintaining even distribution of (-1), violates structural properties and face-product consistency. 10. **Conclusion**:     Therefore, the sum of the eight vertex values and six face products cannot sum to zero.

We need to find a line passing through point ( C ) such that for any point ( D ) different from ( C ) on this line, the perimeter of the triangle ( triangle ABD ) is greater than the perimeter of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). 1. Since the triangles ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ABD ) share side ( AB ), it is sufficient to compare ( AC + CB ) with ( AD + DB ). 2. Extend the line ( AC ) beyond point ( C ) by the length ( CB ). Denote the new point as ( E ). Hence, ( AC + CB = AE ). 3. For the perimeter of ( triangle ABD ) to be larger, the sum ( AD + DB ) should be greater than ( AC + CB ). This implies ( AD + DB > AE ). 4. Notice that the triangle ( triangle BEC ) formed by the extension is isosceles with ( BC = BE ). An important property of isosceles triangles is that the median from the vertex opposite the base (point B in this case) is also the angle bisector, the altitude, and the locus of all points equidistant from ( B ) and ( E ). 5.

Therefore:      [      4k = 31 + 3N      ]    - This comes from the fact that in each move, three stacks get one additional coin and the total increase is (3N). 3. **Solve for (k):**    - Rearrange to find (k):      [      k = frac{31 + 3N}{4}      ]    - Since (k) must be an integer, (31 + 3N) must be divisible by 4. 4. **Find the Minimal (N) to Make (k) Integer:**    - Check for the smallest (N) such that (31 + 3N) is divisible by 4:      [      31 + 3N equiv 0 pmod{4}      ]    - Simplifying modulus operations, consider:      [      31 equiv 3 pmod{4} Rightarrow 3N equiv 1 pmod{4}      ]    - We need to find (N) such that:      [      3N equiv 1 pmod{4}      ]    - Testing values, we find (N = 1) and (3N = 3 notequiv 1 pmod{4}),      (N = 2) and (3N = 6 notequiv 1 pmod{4}),      (N = 3) and (3N = 9 equiv 1 pmod{4}).

To convert the speed from km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s. So, Train A's speed in m/s is: 60 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 16.67 m/s Since Train A crosses a pole in 9 seconds, the length of Train A is the distance it travels in that time: Length of Train A = Speed of Train A * Time Length of Train A = 16.67 m/s * 9 s = 150.03 m Now, let's calculate the relative speed of the two trains when they are moving towards each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Train A's speed = 60 km/hr Train B's speed = 80 km/hr Converting Train B's speed to m/s: 80 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 22.22 m/s Relative speed = Speed of Train A + Speed of Train B Relative speed = 16.67 m/s + 22.22 m/s = 38.89 m/s The total length that needs to be covered for Train A to fully pass Train B is the sum of their lengths: Total length = Length of Train A + Length of Train B Total length = 150.03 m + 200 m = 350.03 m Finally, we calculate the time it takes for Train A to fully pass Train B using the relative speed and the total length: Time = Total length / Relative speed Time = 350.03 m / 38.89 m/s ≈ 9 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{9}  seconds for Train A to fully pass Train B."},{"instruction":"w many ways are there to put 6 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are distinguishable, the boxes are distinguishable, and each box must contain at least 2 balls?","output":"First, acknowledge that initially, each of the 6 balls has 2 choices where to go, making a total of 2^6 = 64 combinations if there were no constraints.

The combinations possible for this selection is binom{6}{2}. The remaining 4 automatically go to the other box (Box B).    - These can be switched, so multiply by 2 for the arrangements (2 balls in Box B, 4 in Box A).

This guarantees that the prime factors of (a + b) are distinct from those of (a). 4. **Constructing (b)**:    Let's construct (b) in a way that (a + b) has at least three different prime factors. Consider the following:    - Choose (b) such that (a + b) is a product of three distinct primes, say (p_1, p_2, p_3).    - For example, if (a) is any positive integer, we can choose (b) such that (a + b = p_1 cdot p_2 cdot p_3), where (p_1, p_2, p_3) are distinct primes not dividing (a). 5. **Example**:    Suppose (a = 2).

With (theta + frac{pi}{6}) ranging from (frac{pi}{2}) to (pi):    - The minimum value of (2 sin left(theta + frac{pi}{6}right)) is (1) (when (theta + frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{2})),    - The maximum value of (2 sin left(theta + frac{pi}{6}right)) is (2) (when (theta + frac{pi}{6} = pi)). 9.

Next, we apply the formula for the square of a binomial, (x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2, where x = (a-2b) and y = 3c: left[left(a-2bright)-3cright]^{2} = left(a-2bright)^{2}-2cdot3cleft(a-2bright)+left(3cright)^{2} 3.

We substitute the given slope widehat{b}=4 and the point (22.5, 160) into the regression line equation. widehat{y} = widehat{b}x + widehat{a} 160 = 4 cdot 22.5 + widehat{a} widehat{a} = 160 - 4 cdot 22.5 widehat{a} = 160 - 90 widehat{a} = 70 Now, we write the regression line equation as: widehat{y} = 4x + 70 Given that the foot length of a certain student is x=24, we substitute this value into the equation to estimate the height. widehat{y} = 4 cdot 24 + 70 widehat{y} = 96 + 70 boxed{widehat{y} = 166} Thus, the estimated height of the student is 166 cm.

Since the work rates are directly proportional to the number of persons, we can set up the following proportion: Work rate of P persons : Work rate of mP persons = Number of P persons : Number of mP persons (W/12) : (W/6) = P : mP Now, we can simplify the work rates by dividing both by W: (1/12) : (1/6) = P : mP We know that (1/6) is twice as much as (1/12), so the ratio of work rates is 1:2. This means that mP must be twice P to have twice the work rate.

Given that the point P(cos a, sin a) is on the line y = -2x, we can deduce that tan a = -2. We can then use these identities to solve for cos (2a + frac{pi}{2}). Step 1: Use the given information to find a relationship between sin a and cos a. Since P(cos a, sin a) is on the line y = -2x, we have sin a = -2cos a. Step 2: Express tan a in terms of sin a and cos a. By definition, tan a = frac{sin a}{cos a}. Substituting the relationship from Step 1, we get tan a = frac{-2cos a}{cos a} = -2. Step 3: Use the cofunction identity to rewrite cos (2a + frac{pi}{2}). The cofunction identity states that cos (A + frac{pi}{2}) = -sin A. Therefore, cos (2a + frac{pi}{2}) = -sin 2a. Step 4: Use the double angle formula to express sin 2a in terms of tan a. The double angle formula for sine is sin 2A = frac{2tan A}{1 + tan^2 A}.

We explore two approaches to solve this problem: combinatorial and linear algebraic. ---  1. First Solution: Combinatorial Approach We start by constructing an undirected bipartite graph (Gamma) from the original directed graph (G): 1. **Vertex Set Construction**:    - Create two copies of the vertex set (V(G)):      - (V_{text{out}}): representing the sets of starting points of directed edges.      - (V_{text{in}}): representing the sets of ending points of directed edges. 2. **Edge Set Construction**:    - For each directed edge (v rightarrow w) in (G), create an undirected edge (vw) in (Gamma) such that:      [      v in V_{text{out}}, quad w in V_{text{in}}      ] 3. **Cycle Characteristics of (Gamma)**:    - Since every city (vertex) in (G) has exactly two incoming and two outgoing edges, each vertex ( in (Gamma) will have degree (2).    - Therefore, (Gamma) is a 2-regular bipartite graph. These characteristics mean (Gamma) decomposes into a disjoint union of even-length cycles. 4. **Perfect Matchings**:    - Each cycle of length (2k) has exactly (2) perfect matchings. This gives us (2) choices per cycle. 5. **Counting Perfect Matchings**:    - If (Gamma) decomposes into (n) disjoint cycles, the number of perfect matchings is:      [      2^n      ] 6. **Conclusion of Combinatorial Approach**:    - Hence, the number of ways to reduce (G) to a 1-regular sub-digraph (where each vertex has exactly one incoming and one outgoing edge) is a power of 2, specifically (2^n) where (n) is the number of disjoint cycles in (Gamma). # Summary of First Solution: The combinatorial approach confirms that the number of ways to reduce roads is (2^n) for some integer (n). ---  2. Second Solution: Linear Algebra over (mathbb{F}_2) (Prime Field of Order 2) This solution hinges on setting up a system of linear equations to reflect our road problem: 1. **Indicator Variables**:    - Assign an indicator variable (x_e) to each edge (e). (x_e = 1) if the road represented by (e) is used, and (x_e = 0) if it is not. 2. **Equations for Outgoing and Incoming Edges**:    - For each vertex (v):      - Let (e_1, e_2) be edges leaving (v): (x_{e_1} + x_{e_2} equiv 1 pmod{2})      - Let (e_3, e_4) be edges entering (v): (x_{e_3} + x_{e_4} equiv 1 pmod{2}) 3. **System Properties**:    - This setup results in a system of linear equations over (mathbb{F}_2). 4. **Pairwise Solutions**:    - Solutions occur in pairs (vec{x}) and (vec{x} + overrightarrow{1}). Hence, solutions must be either zero or a power of two. 5. **Checking for Solutions**:    - Observe that non-trivial linear combinations of equations should not give inconsistency (0 equiv 1 pmod{2}).    - Analyze each variable's appearance. If every variable appears an even number of times, each would appear twice forming an even cycle. Thus, these equations are consistent under modulo 2. 6. **Conclusion of Linear Algebra Approach**:    - Therefore, there exists at least one solution and the total number of solutions is a power of two. # Summary of Second Solution: The linear algebraic approach illustrates that there is a correspondence to (2^n) solutions. --- # Conclusion Both combinatorial and linear algebraic perspectives show that the number of ways to close roads in Onewaynia such that each city has exactly one incoming and one outgoing road is a power of 2.

Calculate the difference:        begin{aligned}    frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2} - fleft(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}right) &= x_{1} + x_{2} + a ln sqrt{x_{1} x_{2}} - left(x_{1} + x_{2} + a ln left(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}right)right)     &= a ln sqrt{x_{1} x_{2}} - a ln left(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}right)     &= a ln left( frac{sqrt{x_{1} x_{2}}}{frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}}right)     &= a ln left(frac{2 sqrt{x_{1} x_{2}}}{x_{1} + x_{2}}right)    end{aligned}     5. Using the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality:        x_{1} + x_{2} geq 2 sqrt{x_{1} x_{2}}        It follows that:        frac{2 sqrt{x_{1} x_{2}}}{x_{1} + x_{2}} leq 1     6. Therefore, since ln left( frac{2 sqrt{x_{1} x_{2}}}{x_{1} + x_{2}} right) leq 0, and given a < 0:        a ln left( frac{2 sqrt{x_{1} x_{2}}}{x_{1} + x_{2}} right) geq 0     7.

We need to show:        f(x) leq (a + 3)x - frac{1}{2}x^2 quad text{for} quad x in [1, e]     2. Starting with:        f(x) = 2x + a ln x     3. Set up the inequality:        2x + a ln x leq (a + 3)x - frac{1}{2}x^2     4. Rearrange to isolate a:        a ln x leq (a + 3)x - 2x - frac{1}{2}x^2 implies a ln x leq ax + 3x - 2x - frac{1}{2}x^2 implies a ln x leq ax + x - frac{1}{2}x^2     5. Simplify:        a(ln x - x) leq x - frac{1}{2}x^2      6. Rewrite the inequality to isolate a:        a leq frac{x - frac{1}{2}x^2}{ln x - x}      7. Define a function for the right-hand side for convenience:        g(x) = frac{x - frac{1}{2}x^2}{ln x - x}      8. Calculate the derivative g'(x) to analyze its behavior over x in [1, e]:        g'(x) = frac{left((1 - x)(x - ln x) - (1 - frac{1}{x})(x - frac{1}{2}x^2)right)}{(ln x - x)^2}     9. Further simplify inside the numerator:        begin{aligned}    g'(x) &= frac{((x - 1) (frac{1}{2} x + 1) - ln x) - left(1 - frac{1}{x}right)left(frac{1}{2}x^2 - xright)}{(ln x - x)^2}     &= frac{(x - 1)(frac{1}{2} x + 1 - ln x)}{(ln x - x)^2}     end{aligned}     10. For x in (1, e), (x - 1) > 0 and left(frac{1}{2}x + 1 - ln xright) > 0. Thus, g'(x) > 0 implies g(x) is strictly increasing on (1, e). 11. Determine the endpoints:        begin{aligned}    g(1) &= text{undefined},      g(e) &= frac{frac{1}{2} e^2 - e}{e - 1} = frac{e^{2} - 2e}{2(e - 1)}    end{aligned}     12. Therefore, as g(x) is increasing and continuous:           a geq g(e) = frac{e^2 - 2e}{2(e - 1)}       Conclusion: a geq frac{e^2 - 2e}{2(e - 1)}  Thus, the constraint on (a) is: boxed{a geq frac{e^2 - 2e}{2(e - 1)}}"},{"instruction":"a village, 40% of the population are adults, and 60% are children.

We know that 23040 male adults constitute 35% of the adult population. To find the total number of adults, we can set up the following equation: 0.35 (Total Adults) = 23040 Now, we solve for the total number of adults: Total Adults = 23040 / 0.35 Total Adults = 65714.2857 Since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we round it to the nearest whole number: Total Adults ≈ 65714 Now, let's find the total population of the village. We know that adults make up 40% of the total population. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 0.40 (Total Population) = Total Adults 0.40 (Total Population) = 65714 Now, we solve for the total population: Total Population = 65714 / 0.40 Total Population = 164285.7143 Again, since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we round it to the nearest whole number: Total Population ≈ 164286 Next, let's calculate the number of literate adults in each gender. We know that the literacy rate among male adults is 75% and among female adults is 62%. Number of literate male adults: 0.75 (Number of Male Adults) = 0.75 * 23040 Number of literate male adults = 17280 To find the number of female adults, we use the total number of adults and subtract the number of male adults: Number of Female Adults = Total Adults - Number of Male Adults Number of Female Adults = 65714 - 23040 Number of Female Adults = 42674 Now, we calculate the number of literate female adults: Number of literate female adults: 0.62 (Number of Female Adults) = 0.62 * 42674 Number of literate female adults = 26457.88 Since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we round it to the nearest whole number: Number of literate female adults ≈ 26458 In summary: - The total population of the village is approximately 164286. - The number of literate male adults is 17280. - The number of literate female adults is approximately boxed{26458} ."},{"instruction":"Translate the graph of the function y=sin 2x to the right by frac{pi}{3} units.

To solve this, we will construct such a quadratic polynomial step-by-step. 1. **Consideration of Polynomial Form:**    We start by considering a quadratic polynomial ( f(x) ) of the form:    [    f(x) = p x^2 + q x + r    ]    where ( p ), ( q ), and ( r ) are coefficients that need to be determined. 2. **Using Vieta's Formulas:**    It helps to derive the polynomial by leveraging Vieta's formulas for polynomial roots.

Applying this to our function, we get:   [   x = -frac{3}{2(-3)} = -frac{3}{-6} = frac{1}{2}   ]   Therefore, the symmetric axis is x=-frac{1}{2}. - **Friendly Coaxial Quadratic Function**: According to the definition, the sum of the coefficients of the quadratic terms of two friendly coaxial quadratic functions is 1. Therefore, if the coefficient of the quadratic term of one function is -3, the coefficient of the quadratic term of its friendly coaxial function is 4 (since 1-(-3)=4). Given that the symmetric axis is the same, the coefficient of the linear term can be found by ensuring the axis of symmetry remains unchanged. Thus, for a function y=ax^2+bx+c, where a=4, and the symmetric axis is x=-frac{1}{2}, we find b as follows:   [   -frac{b}{2a} = -frac{1}{2} implies -frac{b}{2(4)} = -frac{1}{2} implies b = -4   ]   Since the intersection points with the y-axis (the constant term) are the same, the constant term remains 1. Thus, the friendly coaxial quadratic function is:   [   y = 4x^2 - 4x + 1   ]   The relationship between the coefficients of the quadratic terms of the two functions is that their sum is 1. Therefore, the symmetric axis is x=-frac{1}{2}, its friendly coaxial quadratic function is y=4x^2-4x+1, and the relationship between the coefficients of the quadratic terms of the two functions is that their sum is 1.  Part (2) ① Given C_1y=ax^2+4ax+4, its friendly coaxial quadratic function C_2 is: [ y=(1-a)x^2+4(1-a)x+4 ] Setting C_1y=C_2y to find the intersection points: [ ax^2+4ax+4=(1-a)x^2+4(1-a)x+4 implies (2a-1)x^2+4(2a-1)x=0 ] Solving for x: [ x^2+4x=0 implies x(x+4)=0 ] Thus, x=0 or x=-4. This gives us points A(-4,4) and B(0,4), and therefore: [ AB = 4 - (-4) = 8 ] So, the length of segment AB is boxed{4}.  Part (2) ② For C_2: y=(1-a)x^2+4(1-a)x+4, the symmetric axis is x=-2.

At x=-2, C_2 takes the minimum value of 4a. At x=0, C_2 takes the maximum value of 4. Therefore:   [   4 - 4a = 8 implies a = -1   ] - **When 1-a < 0 (a > 1)**, the parabola opens downwards. At x=-2, C_2 takes the maximum value of 4a. At x=0, C_2 takes the minimum value of 4.

Using the values obtained from steps 1 and 2, we have: (a_0+a_2+a_4)^2-(a_1+a_3)^2=(2+sqrt{3})^4(sqrt{3}-2)^4=(-1)^4=1  Therefore, the value of (a_0+a_2+a_4)^2-(a_1+a_3)^2 is boxed{1}."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=ax^{2}ln x.

Therefore, the domain is (-1, 1). Next, we analyze the monotonicity of f(x). The function y = log(t) is increasing with respect to t. Considering t = frac{1-x}{1+x} = -1 + frac{2}{1+x}, we note that the function t is decreasing on (-1, 1) since the denominator 1+x increases on this interval, therefore causing the whole fraction to decrease. Thus, the composite function f(x) = log left( frac{1-x}{1+x} right) is decreasing on (-1, 1) as it is the composition of an increasing function with a decreasing one. (2) We are given the inequality f(2x - 1) < 0, that is  logleft(frac{1 - (2x - 1)}{1 + (2x - 1)}right) = logleft(frac{2 - 2x}{2x}right) = logleft(frac{1 - x}{x}right) < 0. For the inequality log( frac{1 - x}{x} ) < 0 to hold, the argument of the logarithm must be between 0 and 1: 0 < frac{1 - x}{x} < 1. This simplifies to two conditions: 0 < 1 - x quad text{and} quad frac{1 - x}{x} < 1. From 0 < 1 - x, we find that x < 1. From frac{1 - x}{x} < 1, we can rewrite it as 1 < frac{1}{x}, which further implies that x > frac{1}{2} when x is positive. Since the domain from the initial function must still apply, the intersection gives us frac{1}{2} < x < 1. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is boxed{frac{1}{2} < x < 1}."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = aln x  e^x; (1) Discuss the number of extreme points of f(x); (2) If a=2, prove that: f(x) < 0.","output":"Solution: (1) According to the problem, we have f'(x) = frac{a}{x} - e^x = frac{a-xe^x}{x} , (x > 0), When a leqslant 0, f'(x) < 0, the function y=f(x) is decreasing, and there are no extreme points; When a > 0, let f(x)=0, we get a=xe^x. Since y=xe^x is increasing when x > 0, and as x increases, xe^x rightarrow +infty, there exists one solution for xe^x=a in (0,+infty), Let's denote it as x_0. Therefore, the function y=f(x) is increasing in (0,x_0) and decreasing in (x_0,+infty). Thus, the function y=f(x) has one maximum point and no minimum points; In summary: When a leqslant 0, there are no extreme points; when a > 0, the function y=f(x) has one maximum point and no minimum points. (2) For f(x) = 2ln x - e^x, f'(x) = frac{2-xe^x}{x} , (x > 0). From (1), we know f(x) has a maximum value f(x_0), and x_0 satisfies x_0e^{x_0}=2 , text{(1)}, Since y=xe^x is increasing in (0,+infty), and 0 < 2 < e, so x_0 in (0,1), It is known that: f(x)_{text{max}} = f(x_0) = 2ln x_0 - e^{x_0} , text{(2)}, From text{(1)}, we get e^{x_0} = frac{2}{x_0}. Substituting into text{(2)}, we get f(x)_{text{max}} = f(x_0) = 2ln x_0 - frac{2}{x_0}, Let g(x) = 2ln x - frac{2}{x}, then g'(x) = frac{2(x+1)}{x^2} > 0 always holds, Therefore, g(x) is increasing in (0,1), so g(x_0) < g(1) = -2 < 0, i.e., g(x_0) < 0, Thus, f(x) < 0. Therefore, the final answers are: (1) When a leqslant 0, there are no extreme points; when a > 0, the function y=f(x) has boxed{text{one maximum point and no minimum points}}.

The goal is to determine which shape is impossible for her to draw. 1. **Analyze the possible configurations**:    - Let the side length of each equilateral triangle be ( s ).    - Each equilateral triangle has internal angles measuring ( 60^circ ). 2. **Consider configurations for each shape**:        - **Shape A**: This appears to be a larger equilateral triangle made up of the two smaller equilateral triangles.      - Overlaying two equilateral triangles in a back-to-back manner can create a larger equilateral triangle.      - Hence, this shape **is possible** to draw.    - **Shape B**: This corresponds to a parallelogram where the triangles overlap to form a straight line in the middle.      - By placing two triangles so that one overlaps half of the other, this shape can be obtained.      - Hence, this shape **is possible** to draw.    - **Shape C**: This is a rhombus.      - Placing two equilateral triangles such that they touch at one vertex and have adjacent sides aligned creates this shape.      - Hence, this shape **is possible** to draw.    - **Shape D**: This appears to be a kite shape.      - By placing one triangle offset to the other, while touching at one vertex, this can form a kite shape or a similar geometry.      - Hence, this shape **is possible** to draw. 3. **Consider shape E**:    - **Shape E** has an irregular form that does not seem to be formed by two equilateral triangles correctly placed together.      - Since every configuration of touching or overlapping triangles should maintain a certain symmetry or regularity (parallelogram, larger triangle, or rhombus), shape E, which lacks these properties, seems geometrically impossible. 4. **Evaluate implications**:    - Every shape aside from E fits with the description of drawing patterns formed by overlapping or touching equilateral triangles.    - Shape E's irregularity contradicts the geometric properties and placement possibilities of equilateral triangles. **Conclusion**:  Thus, the shape that is impossible for Emily to draw is indeed shape E.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this: L ∪ B = L + B - L ∩ B We don't know L ∩ B yet, but we can find it by considering the dogs that are neither long-furred nor brown. Since there are 60 dogs in total: L ∪ B + Neither L nor B = Total number of dogs L ∪ B + 10 = 60 L + B - L ∩ B + 10 = 60 35 + 25 - L ∩ B + 10 = 60 70 - L ∩ B + 10 = 60 80 - L ∩ B = 60 L ∩ B = 80 - 60 L ∩ B = 20 So, there are 20 dogs that are both long-furred and brown.

Similarly for other sides. 5. **Combining the Inequalities:**    Summing these:    [    PA + PB + PC + PD geq P_1A + P_1B + P_2C + P_2D    ]    Equality holds if (P) lies on (P_1) and (P_2). 6. **Measurement Along Geometric Median:**    The line (m) passing through midpoints of opposite pairs of edges acts as a joint midpoint line. The projections further reduce if P moves from P_1 and P_2 to O. Thus:    [    (P_1A + P_1B) + (P_2C + P_2D) geq (P_0A + P_0B) + (P_0C + P_0D)    ]    Using reflectional properties and midpoint logic, the total minimal distance is achieved at O. 7. **Conclusion for Smaller Distances:**    Therefore, when P shifts to the origin O, it results in a minimal sum of distances from the vertices,    which cannot be bettered by any point other than O. Conclusively,  [ boxed{O} ] # II: 1. **Equicentric Tetrahedron and Planes:**    Imagine parallel auxiliary planes through each vertex and opposing face of the tetrahedron T. Define PA, PB, PC, PD as usual distances, and t_A, t_B, t_C, t_D as perpendicular distances to respective planes. 2. **Comparison and Perpendicular Projection:**    Since any point is at least as far as its perpendicular distance from a plane, we have:    [    PA geq t_A, , PB geq t_B, , PC geq t_C, , PD geq t_D    ]    Equality holds if P is on the normal dropped from the vertex to the plane. 3. **Summing Perpendicular Distances:**    Summing these:    [    PA + PB + PC + PD geq t_A + t_B + t_C + t_D    ]    Equality holds if P is on the line interchanging perpendicular distances to the auxiliary planes. 4. **Transformation into Sub-Tetrahedron:**    Construct a new tetrahedron T_1 by scaling and reflecting through point O. This T_1 considered from the initial point's equality meets auxiliary planes to give minimum sum values. 5. **Distance Sum Consistency:**    Internal/external aspects of T_1 validate that the sum of distances is invariant:    [    t_A + t_B + t_C + t_D = m_1    ]    Where m_1 is the median distance along the height within T_1, enforcing the equality for tetrahedron intersection. 6. **Conclusion for Optimal Identity Distance:**    Hence, P situated at O within tetrahedron T records minimized distances.

The focus of the parabola is ( F(0, frac{1}{4}) ) and the directrix is the line ( y = -frac{1}{4} ). 2. **Equation of the tangent through an external point**: Let ( P(u, v) ) be an external point such that ( 0 < u^2 - v ). The tangent lines through ( P ) can be expressed with the slope ( m ) as ( y = m(x - u) + v ). This line touches the parabola if it intersects it at exactly one point. 3. **Tangency condition**: Substituting ( y = m(x - u) + v ) into the parabola’s equation ( y = x^2 ), we get the quadratic equation:    [    x^2 - mx + mu - v = 0    ]    For this equation to have precisely one solution, the discriminant must be zero:    [    m^2 - 4(mu - v) = 0    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    m^2 - 4mu + 4v = 0    ] 4. **Finding the slopes ( m_1 ) and ( m_2 )**: The discriminant of the equation ( m^2 - 4mu + 4v = 0 ) is:    [    16u^2 - 16v > 0    ]    Since it's an external point, the quadratic equation has two real roots ( m_1 ) and ( m_2 ), which are the slopes of the tangents. 5. **Angle between tangents**: Let ( varphi ) be the angle between the two tangents. Using the tangent subtraction formula:    [    |tan varphi| = left|frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1m_2}right|    ]    Given that ( varphi = 30^circ ), we have:    [    tan 30^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}    ] 6. **Setting up the equation**: From the condition:    [    left( frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 m_2} right)^2 = frac{1}{3}    ]    Using Vieta's formulas, ( m_1 + m_2 = 4u ) and ( m_1 m_2 = 4v ), we substitute:    [    left( 4u right)^2 - 4 cdot 4v = frac{1}{3}(1 + 4v)^2    ]    Simplifying:    [    16u^2 - 16v = frac{1}{3}(1 + 4v)^2    ] 7. **Deriving the conic section equation**: Rearranging and reducing, we reach:    [    48(u^2 - v) = (1 + 4v)^2    ]    After rearrangement and completing the square:    [    u^2 - frac{left( v + frac{7}{4} right)^2}{3} = -1    ] 8. **Identification of the conic section**: The equation represents a hyperbola with its transverse axis along the (y)-axis and shifted.     Therefore, the geometric locus of all points ( P(u, v) ) from which two tangents can be drawn to the parabola ( y = x^2 ) that include an angle ( 30^circ ) is described by the hyperbola:    [    u^2 - frac{left( v + frac{7}{4} right)^2}{3} = -1    ] **Conclusion**: The sought geometric locus is a hyperbola given by the equation: [ boxed{     u^2 - frac{left( v + frac{7}{4} right)^2}{3} = -1 } ]"},{"instruction":"One bacterium splits into 8 bacteria of the next generation.

We are asked to find the smallest possible number of pairs of friends, where one is a knight and the other is a liar. First, let's denote: - Knights as ( K_1, K_2, ldots, K_{100} ) - Liars as ( L_1, L_2, ldots, L_{100} ) Assume the statement \\"All my friends are liars\\" was made by at least 50 knights. Each knight making this statement must have at least one liar as a friend (since they tell the truth). This directly gives us at least 50 knight-liar pairs. If less than 50 knights said, \\"All my friends are liars,\\" then the statement must have been made by at least 50 liars. Since liars always lie, each liar making this statement must have at least one knight as a friend. This arrangement would also give us at least 50 knight-liar pairs. To show that it is possible to have exactly 50 knight-liar pairs, let's construct an example: 1. Consider knights ( K_1, K_2, ldots, K_{50} ) each being friends with exactly one unique liar from ( L_1, L_2, ldots, L_{50} ). Thus, each knight ( K_i ) is friends only with ( L_i ), and each liar ( L_i ) is friends only with ( K_i ). 2. Knights ( K_{51}, K_{52}, ldots, K_{100} ) can only be friends with other knights from this subset. Similarly, liars ( L_{51}, L_{52}, ldots, L_{100} ) can only be friends with other liars from this subset. Given this structure: - The 50 knight-liar pairs ( (K_i, L_i) ) for ( i in {1, 2, ldots, 50} ) are accounted for. - Knights ( K_{51}, ldots, K_{100} ) will truthfully announce \\"All my friends are knights.\\" - Liars ( L_{51}, ldots, L_{100} ) will falsely announce \\"All my friends are knights\\" (because they are only friends with liars). Thus, each of the 100 statements (\\"All my friends are knights\\" and \\"All my friends are liars\\") is made correctly by 100 people.

[    text{Initial size} = 50    ]    [    text{Next size} = 2n = 48    ]    Repeat this decrement down to manageable group sizes. 3. **Group Formation**:    Combine the formed groups into sets of 5 groups, ensuring that each group has exactly 10 speakers of each language.

We consider these cases:    **Case 1: (N_{af} neq 0), (N_{an} neq 0), (N_{fn} neq 0):**    - Select a student from each (N_{af}), (N_{an}), (N_{fn}) sets. This ensures each language is covered in the group.       **Case 2: (N_{af} = 0), (N_{an} neq 0), (N_{fn} neq 0):**    - Ensure that students from (N_{an}) and (N_{fn}) are covered, and recalibrate to cover the missing (N_a) (pure English), indicating (N_{a} leq 1). Therefore, one student from (N_a, N_f, N_{an}, N_{fn}).    **Case 3: (N_{fn} neq 0), (N_{afn} neq 0), ((N_{an} = 0, N_{af} = 0)):**    - Combine students from (N_{a}, N_{fn}) reflecting the minimum addition (N_{a}+N_{a fn}=N_{a}+N_n)    **Case 4: (N_{fn} neq 0), where (N_{afn} = N_{an} = N_{af} = 0):**    - Sub-case a) (N_{fn} geq 2): combine the students from (N_a) (pure English)    - Sub-case b) (N_{fn} = 1, N_{a} geq 1): Students from (N_f, N_{fn}, N_a, N_n)    **Case 5: (N_{afn} = 0), covering (N_{a} = 2n):**    - Sub-case a): Take necessary students into group.    - Sub-case b): Combine the remainder such that minimum group requirements are fulfilled.    5. **Conclusion**:    We have repartitioned the students into several cases while ensuring each partition maintains at least 10 students speaking each language. This constant condition across all reductions ensures the final set completes the requirement. Thus, we successfully divide the students into 5 groups, with each group having precisely 10 students who speak each of the three languages.

We need to determine the locus of P as D moves along BC. 2. **Step 1: Specific Cases for D**    - When D coincides with point B: In this situation, E coincides with B and F coincides with C, therefore triangle AEF degenerates, and the orthocenter P coincides with N, where BN perp AC.    - When D coincides with point C: Similarly, E coincides with C and F coincides with B, so triangle AEF again degenerates, and the orthocenter P coincides with M, where CM perp AB. 3. **Step 2: When D is the midpoint of BC**    - Let D be the midpoint of BC.

Therefore, we can write the equation: (Speed of first projectile + Speed of second projectile) * Time = Distance (432 km/h + V2) * 2.5 h = 2520 km Now we can solve for V2: (432 km/h + V2) * 2.5 h = 2520 km 1080 km/h + 2.5V2 = 2520 km 2.5V2 = 2520 km - 1080 km/h 2.5V2 = 1440 km Now divide both sides by 2.5 to find V2: V2 = 1440 km / 2.5 h V2 = 576 km/h So the speed of the second projectile is boxed{576}  km/h."},{"instruction":"Jenna is planning a road trip.

It is assumed that the growth rate of the total number of deliveries per month by the company is the same. (1) Find the monthly average growth rate of the total number of deliveries by the express delivery company.

Given that each person can deliver up to 0.6 thousand items per month, the total delivery capacity of the 21 staff members is: [0.6 times 21 = 12.6] thousand items. Comparing the delivery capacity with the delivery task for June: [12.6 < 13.31] This indicates that the current staff cannot meet the delivery demand. To find the minimum number of additional staff needed: [frac{13.31 - 12.6}{0.6} = frac{0.71}{0.6} approx 1.1833] Since we cannot have a fraction of a staff member, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us at least 2 additional staff members needed to meet the delivery task for June.

Hence, the graph of the function y=a^{x+2}-3 always passes through the fixed point (-2, -2).

Since (ln left(sin frac{1}{2}right)) is a constant, its derivative is zero: [ left(ln left(sin frac{1}{2}right)right)' = 0 ] 2. Now, we focus on the second term: [ left(-frac{1}{24} cdot frac{cos^2(12x)}{sin(24x)}right)' ] 3. Using the constant multiple rule and factoring out (-frac{1}{24}): [ y' = -frac{1}{24} left( frac{cos^2(12x)}{sin(24x)} right)' ] 4.

First, find the derivatives ( u' ) and ( v' ). For ( u = cos^2(12x) ), using the chain rule and the power rule: [ u' = 2 cos(12x) cdot (-sin(12x)) cdot 12 = -24 cos(12x) sin(12x) ] For ( v = sin(24x) ): [ v' = 24 cos(24x) ] 6.

Simplify the numerator: [ = frac{-24 cos(12x) sin(12x) sin(24x) - 24 cos^2(12x) cos(24x)}{sin^2(24x)} ] 8. Factor out (-24 cos(12x)) from the numerator: [ = frac{-24 cos(12x) left( sin(12x) sin(24x) + cos(12x) cos(24x) right)}{sin^2(24x)} ] 9. Use the angle sum identity (cos(a + b) = cos(a) cos(b) - sin(a) sin(b)) with ( a = 12x ) and ( b = 12x ): [ cos(12x + 12x) = cos(24x) = cos(12x) cos(24x) - sin(12x) sin(24x) ] Since (cos(24x) = cos(24x)), we add a negative sign: [ sin(12x) sin(24x) + cos(12x) cos(24x) = cos(24x - 12x) = cos(12x) ] 10. Since (cos(12x - 12x) = cos(0) = 1), we have: [ cos(0) = 1 ] 11. Hence, the numerator simplifies to: [ -24 cos(12x) (cos(0)) = -24 cos(12x) ] 12.

Multiplying through by the least common denominator, which is 48, to clear the fractions, we get: 4.8s + 10s = 48. Combining like terms, we have: 14.8s = 48. Solving for s, we divide both sides by 14.8: s = frac{48}{14.8}.

(2) If the total cost of fuel and electricity for a hybrid trip from point A to point B does not exceed 39 yuan, how many kilometers at least must be traveled using electricity?","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Cost of Traveling One Kilometer Using Electricity Only Let's denote the cost of traveling one kilometer using electricity only as x yuan. According to the problem, the fuel cost per kilometer is 0.5 yuan more than the electricity cost per kilometer. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the total costs and the relationship between fuel and electricity costs: [ frac{76}{x + 0.5} = frac{26}{x} ] To solve for x, we cross-multiply: [ 76x = 26(x + 0.5) ] Expanding the equation: [ 76x = 26x + 13 ] Subtracting 26x from both sides: [ 50x = 13 ] Dividing by 50: [ x = frac{13}{50} ] Simplifying the fraction: [ x = 0.26 ] After verification, we confirm that x = 0.26 satisfies the original equation. Therefore, the cost of traveling one kilometer using electricity only is boxed{0.26 text{ yuan}}.  Part 2: Minimum Kilometers Traveled Using Electricity For a hybrid trip from point A to point B with y kilometers traveled using electricity, the total cost of fuel and electricity should not exceed 39 yuan. Given the cost per kilometer using electricity is 0.26 yuan, and the cost per kilometer using fuel is 0.26 + 0.5 = 0.76 yuan, we can set up the following inequality: [ 0.26y + (100 - y) times 0.76 leqslant 39 ] Here, 100 represents the total kilometers traveled, which is derived from the total electricity cost divided by the cost per kilometer using electricity, i.e., frac{26}{0.26} = 100. Simplifying the inequality: [ 0.26y + 76 - 0.76y leqslant 39 ] Combining like terms: [ -0.5y leqslant -37 ] Dividing by -0.5 and flipping the inequality sign: [ y geqslant 74 ] Therefore, at least boxed{74} kilometers must be traveled using electricity to ensure the total cost does not exceed 39 yuan."},{"instruction":"f two distinct members of the set {3, 5, 7, 21, 25, 35, 42, 51, 70} are randomly selected and multiplied, what is the probability that the product is a multiple of 105?","output":"To find pairs that generate a product multiple of 105, factorization needs at least one factor of 3, one factor of 5, and one factor of 7: - **Numbers with a factor of 3**: 3, 21, 42, 51 - **Numbers with a factor of 5**: 5, 25, 35, 70 - **Numbers with a factor of 7**: 7, 21, 35, 42, 70 We now count the successful pairs: 1.

Since the inscribed circle is tangent to the two radii and the arc of the sector, let's identify the points of tangency as B, D, E. 4. Consider the geometry of the sector and the inscribed circle:    - From the tangency points, the radii connecting the center O to B, D, and E will be equal to r. That is, BO = DO = EO = r.    - The distance from the center of the sector O to the point where the radius of the sector meets half the central angle (i.e., 30^circ) is R - r.    - Thus, DO = (R - r) cos(30^circ). 5.

In -2x^{2}y, the variables are x and y, with x raised to the power of 2 and y raised to the power of 1. Therefore, any monomial of the same type must have the same variables raised to the same powers. An example of such a monomial is x^{2}y. 2. **Coefficient of the Monomial**: The coefficient of a monomial is the numerical factor. In -2x^{2}y, the coefficient is -2. However, since the question asks for a monomial of the same type, the coefficient can vary. For example, in x^{2}y, the coefficient is implicitly 1. 3. **Degree of the Monomial**: The degree of a monomial is the sum of the exponents of all its variables. In -2x^{2}y, the degree is 2 + 1 = 3. Therefore, any monomial of the same type will also have a degree of 3.

This requires that the first piece of the function (-{x}^{2}-ax-5) is increasing for x leq 1 and the second piece (frac{a}{x}) is increasing for x > 1. 2. **Examining Each Piece**:    - For the first piece, -{x}^{2}-ax-5, to be increasing on its domain, the derivative -2x-a must be greater than or equal to 0 at x = 1. This gives us:      [-2(1)-a geq 0 Rightarrow -2-a geq 0 Rightarrow a leq -2]    - For the second piece, frac{a}{x}, to be increasing for x > 1, a must be positive because the denominator (x) is positive and increasing, and we want the whole fraction to increase. However, this directly contradicts our previous finding that a leq -2. Hence, this consideration is incorrect. The correct realization is that for frac{a}{x} to be increasing for x > 1, since the derivative is -frac{a}{x^2}, it implies a must be negative for the derivative to be positive, reinforcing our previous finding. 3. **Ensuring Continuity at x = 1**:    - For the function to be monotonically increasing across the entire domain, it must also be continuous at x = 1. Setting the two pieces equal to each other at x = 1 gives:      [-1^2 - a(1) - 5 = frac{a}{1} Rightarrow -1 - a - 5 = a Rightarrow -6 = 2a Rightarrow a = -3]    Thus, for continuity at x=1 and the function to be increasing just before and after x=1, a must satisfy -3 leq a leq -2. 4. **Final Range**:    - Combining these insights, we find that for the function to be monotonically increasing across its entire domain, a must satisfy both a leq -2 and a = -3, leading us to the conclusion that a must be in the range [-3, -2]. Therefore, the range of real number a is boxed{left[-3,-2right]}."},{"instruction":"Bob picked 450 apples for his entire family to eat.

The vertices of the triangle lie on the hyperbola xy = 4. The circumradius ( r ) is the distance from (2,2) to any vertex of the triangle.

We set up the equation of a circle centered at (2,2) with radius ( r ): [ (x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 = r^2 ] This circle must intersect the hyperbola ( xy = 4 ) at three points. Substituting ( y = frac{4}{x} ) into the circle's equation: [ (x-2)^2 + left(frac{4}{x} - 2right)^2 = r^2 ] Expanding and simplifying leads to a sextic equation in ( x ), which can be solved numerically or graphically to find ( x ) coordinates of the vertices.

All these numbers must be less than 1000.

The maximum number ( n ) written must satisfy ( n < 1000 ). Converting 1000 into base 5:    [    1000_{10} = 14400_5    ]    We can see the upper limit of the numbers in base 5 for our sequence. 2. **Understanding the Generation Process:**    Starting from 1, the sequence is generated by repeatedly applying the transformations ( n to 5n ) and ( n to 5n + 1 ). This structure can be represented using a tree:        - Root: ( 1 ) (which in base 5 is ( 1 ))    - Second level: ( 5 times 1 = 5 rightarrow 10_5 ), and ( 5 times 1 + 1 = 6 rightarrow 11_5 )    - Continue this process until numbers exceed 1000     3. **Restriction on Sum Generation:**    We need to consider the forms of numbers in base 5. The possible forms for numbers generated by this process in base 5 are:     - For ( 5n ): Derived by adding ( 0 ) to the base-5 representation.     - For ( 5n + 1 ): Derived by adding ( 1 ). 4. **Calculation of Distinct Sums:**    Let's consider the digits possible in numbers formed:    - With digits in {0, 1} for base-5 representations because any number formed will exclude higher base-5 digits.        To count valid unique sums of two such distinct numbers, we must:    - Include at least one '1'.    - Not form all identical digits.     5. **Total Combinations with 0, 1, 2:**    Each digit can be ( 0, 1, 2 ), summing up to configurations:    [    3^5    ]    However:    - Exclude digits only with zeros, and those only with zero leading and a one, meaning pure ones or missing twos.

Therefore,    [    15 + frac{11m}{M} = 16 implies frac{11m}{M} = 1 implies M = 11m.    ] 7. The original number (15M + 11m) simplifies to:    [    15(11m) + 11m = 165m + 11m = 176m.    ] 8. Since (m) is the smallest odd divisor and must divide 176, the possible values for (m) are the odd divisors of 176. 9. Factoring 176:    [    176 = 2^4 times 11.    ] 10.

We need to show that the quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) has two distinct roots. To do this, we need to consider the discriminant (Delta) of the quadratic equation, which is given by:    [    Delta = b^2 - 4ac    ]    The quadratic equation has two distinct roots if and only if (Delta > 0). 3. From the rewritten inequality, (a(a + c - b) < -2016), observe that we already know:    [    a(a - b + c) < -2016 < 0    ]    This inequality says that the product (a(a - b + c)) is negative.  4. We deduce that since (a neq 0) (otherwise the inequality (2016 < 0) would hold, which is impossible):    - If (a > 0), then (a - b + c < 0), implying (a - b + c < 0)    - If (a < 0), then (a - b + c > 0), implying (a - b + c > 0)     5. Consider what happens when evaluating (f(-1)), where (f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c). For (f(-1)), we have:    [    f(-1) = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = a - b + c     ]    Given the relation (a(a - b + c) < 0), we know (f(-1) = a - b + c) is such that (a f(-1) < 0). 6. When (a > 0), (f(-1)) must be negative (since (a(a - b + c) < 0)). 7. When (a < 0), (f(-1)) must be positive (since (a(a - b + c) < 0)). 8. Hence, in both cases ((a > 0) or (a < 0)), the quadratic function (f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c) evaluates negatively at (x = -1):    [    f(-1) < 0    ]     9. Since (f(-1) < 0), and knowing (a neq 0), the parabola (y = ax^2 + bx + c) must intersect the x-axis in two places because:    - For (a > 0), the parabola opens upwards and has two intercepts with the x-axis when (f(x) < 0) at some point in the domain (here at (x = -1)).    - For (a < 0), the parabola opens downwards and must have two intercepts with the x-axis to make (f(x) < 0) at some point in the domain (here at (x = -1)).     10. This guarantees that the discriminant (Delta) of (ax^2 + bx + c) is positive, ensuring two distinct roots for the quadratic equation.

The derivative of g(x) is g'(x)=e^x+e^{-x}, which is always greater than 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. This implies that g(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. 2. **Determining the Function f(x):**    Since g(x) is monotonically increasing and g(y-sin x) = g(x^{2013}), we conclude that y-sin x = x^{2013}. Therefore, f(x) = sin x + x^{2013}. This means option A is incorrect because it suggests f(x) = sin x - x^{2023}, which does not match our finding. 3. **Checking if f(x) is an Odd Function:**    To see if f(x) is odd, we check f(-x):    [    f(-x) = sin(-x) + (-x)^{2013} = -sin(x) - x^{2013} = -f(x).    ]    Since f(-x) = -f(x), f(x) is indeed an odd function. Therefore, option B is correct. 4. **Monotonicity of f(x):**    The derivative of f(x), f'(x) = cos x + 2013x^{2012}, helps us determine the monotonicity. The second derivative, f''(x) = -sin x + 2013 times 2012x^{2011}, is positive for x geq 0 since sin x < x for x > 0. This implies f'(x) is increasing, and since f'(0) = 1 > 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [0, +infty). Hence, option C is correct. 5. **Determining the Value of a:**    Given f(x-ae^{2x-1}) + f(xln x) < 0, and since f(x) is odd, we have f(x-ae^{2x-1}) < f(-xln x). This implies a > frac{x+xln x}{e^{2x-1}}. Analyzing the function k(x) = x - 1 - ln x, we find it has a minimum at x=1, suggesting x geq 1 + ln x. Thus, frac{x+xln x}{e^{2x-1}} leq frac{x^2}{e^{2x-1}}. The function m(x) = frac{x^2}{e^{2x-1}} has a maximum at x=1, leading to m(x) leq frac{1}{e}.

This can be described as:       [       {(a, y, z) mid z = ay, forall y, z in mathbb{R}}       ] 2. **Verifying Condition (1):**        - It's easy to see that these two families of lines intersect each other such that every point in space is intersected by exactly one line from each family.      - For example, let’s choose a point ((x_0, y_0, z_0)).

Let this intersection be at ((0, b, c)).      - The line from the first family passing through this intersection point intersects the lines through (P) and (Q) at points (M) and (K) respectively. Thus, the polygonal line (PMKQ) satisfies the connection condition.    - **Case 2:** (x_1 = x_2)      - If (x_1 = x_2), then choose a point (Sleft(x_1 + 1, y_1, z_1right)). The line segment (PS) lies on a line from the first family.      - Since (S) and (Q) do not share the same (x)-coordinate, from Case 1, there exists a polygonal line connecting (S) and (Q).      - Adding the line segment (PS) to this polygonal line completes the connection.

The possible values for d are 1, 2, 4, 8. To find the least n, we can try these values: - For d=1, 10^p = 16n/1 Rightarrow n = 10^p/16. Since we want n to be an integer, p must be such that 10^p is divisible by 16. The smallest p satisfying this is 4. Thus, n = 10^4/16 = 625. - For d=2, similar calculations show that n would be 312.5, which is not an integer. - For d=4, n would be 156.25, which is not an integer. - For d=8, n would be 78.125, which is not an integer. Therefore, the smallest n for an integer d is with d=1 and n=625, making the original number 10^4 + 625 = 10625.

The goal now is to find the minimum value of the sum of the squares of distances from point (M) to points (A), (B), and (C).  4. First calculate the squared distances from (M) to the points (A), (B), and (C):     - The distance from (M) to (A) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:      [     MA = sqrt{AD^2 + MD^2} = sqrt{a^2 + x^2}     ]     Thus, the square of this distance is:      [     MA^2 = a^2 + x^2     ]     - The distance from (M) to (B) is represented as the horizontal distance along the line (BC):     [     MB = |MD - DB| = |x - b|     ]     Thus, the square of this distance is:      [     MB^2 = (x - b)^2      ]     - The distance from (M) to (C) is:     [     MC = |MD - DC| = |x - c|     ]     Thus, the square of this distance is:      [     MC^2 = (x - c)^2      ] 5.

That is, we assume ( |a - b| < 2sqrt{n+1} ). 2. Squaring both sides of the inequality ( |a - b| < 2sqrt{n+1} ), we get:    [    (a - b)^2 < (2sqrt{n+1})^2 = 4(n+1) = 4n + 4    ] 3.

To check the divisibility by 36, we know a number is divisible by 36 if and only if it is divisible by both 4 and 9 (because 36=4 times 9).  1. **Divisibility by 4**: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. Since '36' is divisible by 4, ab36 is divisible by 4 for any choice of a and b. 2. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. So, the sum a+b+3+6 = a+b+9 must be divisible by 9. Therefore, a+b must be divisible by 9. We have a few options for a+b: 0, 9, 18, 27 (since a and b must be between 0 and 9 inclusive, the maximum sum is 18, and considering sums reduced modulo 9, we cover the possibilities).    - a+b=0, a+b=9, and a+b=18 cover all possible cases.    - If a+b=0, only one value is possible, which is (0,0).    - If a+b=9, multiple pairs (a,b) are possible including (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), and (9,0), yielding 9 possibilities.    - If a+b=18, multiple pairs (a,b) are possible including (9,9), yielding 1 possibility.
