Each inclination is divided by points (A_2), (B_2), and (C_2) respectively, in the same ratio (k:1) from their bases. This means:    - (A_2) divides (AA_1) such that (frac{AA_2}{A_2A_1} = k)    - (B_2) divides (BB_1) such that (frac{BB_2}{B_2B_1} = k)    - (C_2) divides (CC_1) such that (frac{CC_2}{C_2C_1} = k) 3.

Since the parallel lines are drawn, the heights (perpendicular distances between corresponding lines) remain unchanged. 5. **Side Ratio Calculations:**    Since (A_2) divides (AA_1) in the ratio (k:1), the length (AA_2 = k cdot A_2A_1).

First Method: 1. **Introduction**:         Given the points M and N which are the intersections of the angle bisectors of angle A with the external angle at C, and angle B with the external angle at D respectively, we need to prove that the midpoint K of the segment MN is equidistant from the lines AB and CD. 2. **Define Midpoint and Distances**:    Let K be the midpoint of MN, x and y be the distances from points M and N to the base AD respectively, and h be the height of the trapezoid.  3. **Observation about Distances**:    Since M lies on the bisector of the external angle at A, it is equidistant from the lines AB and AD. Similarly, N lies on the bisector of the external angle at B and is equidistant from the lines AB and BC.        Therefore, the distance from point K to AB can be represented as the arithmetic mean of the distances from M and N to AB and also accounting for the heights:    [    text{Distance from } K text{ to } AB = frac{x + y + h}{2}    ] 4. **Calculate Distance to CD**:    Following a similar argument, the distance from K to CD would also be calculated as follows:    [    text{Distance from } K text{ to } CD = frac{x + y + h}{2}    ] 5. **Conclusion**:    Since both distances are equal, the midpoint K of segment MN is equidistant from the lines AB and CD.

Similarly, the bisectors of angles B and the external angle at A are parallel to each other. 3. **Parallelogram Formation**:    Given the parallel properties, the quadrilateral MXNY forms a parallelogram, where the midpoint of MN lies on the line XY.  4. **Center of Excircle**:    Specifically, X is considered the center of the excircle for triangle BPC because it lies on the intersection of the bisectors of the external angles at B and C. Similarly, Y is the center of the excircle for triangle APD. 5. **Conclusion**:    Since X and Y (and hence K) lie on the angle bisector of angle APD, the midpoint of MN is equidistant from the lines AB and CD.

We can find the formula for its area S = sqrt{(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)(p-d)}, where (p = frac{a+b+c+d}{2}) is the semi-perimeter. 3. Using the same approach as above, we aim to maximize:    [    (p-a)(p-b)(p-c)(p-d) leq left[frac{(p-a)+(p-b)+(p-c)+(p-d)}{4}right]^4 = left(frac{2p}{4}right)^4 = left(frac{p}{2}right)^4 = frac{p^4}{16}    ] 4. Thus:    [    S^2 leq frac{p^4}{16}    ]    [    S leq frac{p^2}{4}    ] 5. Equality holds when (p-a=p-b=p-c=p-d), implying (a = b = c = d). Thus, the quadrilateral must be a square.     Conclusion: The quadrilateral with the maximum area, given a fixed perimeter, is a square. blacksquare  Problem 75: Prove that among all convex n-gons with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is a regular n-gon. 1. Using the method from previous parts, we extend the proof to an n-gon. 2. Using the central angle theorem and properties of regular polygons, it can be shown that:    [    frac{S}{P^2} = frac{1}{4n} cotleft(frac{180^circ}{n}right)    ] 3. By properties of convex polygons and the AM-GM Inequality, the equality holds only if the n-gon is regular.     Conclusion: Among all convex n-gons with a given perimeter, the one with the maximum area is a regular n-gon. blacksquare These detailed solutions illustrate the application of Heron's formula, Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality, and maximization principles to conclude that an equilateral triangle, square, and regular n-gon maximize the area for given perimeters."},{"instruction":"The first might be correct.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution. 1. **Define Variables and Equations**:     - Let the number of tourists be denoted by ( n ).     - Let the total number of cookies in each pack be denoted by ( k ). 2. **First Condition**:     - When two packs of cookies are divided among the tourists, one cookie remains, so:         [         2k equiv 1 pmod{n}         ]     - This equation tells us that ( 2k ) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by ( n ). 3. **Second Condition**:     - When three packs of cookies are divided among the tourists, 13 cookies remain, so:         [         3k equiv 13 pmod{n}         ]     - This equation tells us that ( 3k ) leaves a remainder of 13 when divided by ( n ). 4. **Combine and Analyze**:     - The goal is to find ( n ) such that both modular conditions are satisfied.     - We need to solve:         [         2k equiv 1 pmod{n}         ]         and         [         3k equiv 13 pmod{n}         ] 5. **Manipulating the First Condition**:     - From the first condition, solving for ( k ), we get:         [         k equiv frac{1}{2} pmod{n}         ]     - This implies ( k = frac{1}{2} + mn ) for some integer ( m ). 6. **Substitute ( k ) in the Second Condition**:     - Substitute ( k ) into the second equation:         [         3 left( frac{1}{2} + mn right) equiv 13 pmod{n}         ]     - Simplify this to:         [         frac{3}{2} + 3mn equiv 13 pmod{n}         ]     - Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:         [         3 + 6mn equiv 26 pmod{n}         ]     - Rearrange the equation:         [         3 equiv 26 pmod{n}         ]     - This simplifies to:         [         26 - 3 equiv 0 pmod{n}         ]     - Therefore:         [         n mid 23         ] 7. **Determine ( n )**:     - Since ( 23 ) is a prime number, the only divisor of ( 23 ) is itself. 8. **Conclusion**:     - Thus, the number of tourists in the group must be ( n = 23 ).

Since ( x^3 + y^3 ) is a product of distinct primes raised to some powers, ( d ) must be a divisor of ( x^3 + y^3 ). 2.

The pieces do not need to be of equal size or shape, and the cuts can be made in any direction. 2. **Analyzing the Cutting Process:**    Let's denote the number of cuts made in three perpendicular directions as (a), (b), and (c). Each cut in a new direction can potentially increase the number of pieces significantly. 3. **General Formula for Maximum Pieces:**    The maximum number of pieces (P) that can be obtained with (a), (b), and (c) cuts in three perpendicular directions is given by:    [    P = (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)    ]    This formula accounts for the fact that each cut in a new direction can intersect all previous cuts, thereby increasing the number of pieces. 4. **Setting Up the Equation:**    We need to find the minimum number of cuts such that:    [    (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) geq 100    ] 5. **Finding the Minimum Cuts:**    To minimize the number of cuts, we should try to balance the values of (a), (b), and (c) as much as possible. Let's start with an equal distribution:    [    (a+1) = (b+1) = (c+1) = sqrt[3]{100} approx 4.64    ]    Since (a), (b), and (c) must be integers, we test nearby integer values. 6. **Testing Integer Values:**    - If (a = b = c = 3):      [      (3+1)(3+1)(3+1) = 4 times 4 times 4 = 64 quad (text{too few pieces})      ]    - If (a = b = 4) and (c = 3):      [      (4+1)(4+1)(3+1) = 5 times 5 times 4 = 100 quad (text{exactly 100 pieces})      ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The minimum number of cuts required is:    [    a + b + c = 4 + 4 + 3 = 11    ] The final answer is (boxed{11})"},{"instruction":"Cherries are a fruit rich in vitamins and trace elements, with a sweet taste loved by many.

We are given that the intersection points of (S_1) with (S_2) and (S_3) with (S_4) lie on a single circle or a line. 2. **Apply inversion:**    To simplify the problem, we will use an inversion with the center at the intersection point of (S_1) and (S_2). Under this inversion, the intersection points of the given circles and their relationships can be transformed into simpler geometric entities, such as lines and points of intersection. 3. **Transforming the problem:**    After the inversion:    - The circles (S_1) and (S_2) transform into straight lines (l_1) and (l_2) that intersect at the point of inversion.    - This rearrangement implies that the problem translates into showing that after inversion, the remaining intersection points also line up on a single circle or a straight line. 4. **Observe intersection points under inversion:**    - Line (l_1), which corresponds to circle (S_1), intersects a transformed circle (S_4^*) at points (A) and (B).    - Line (l_2), which corresponds to circle (S_2), intersects transformed circle (S_3^*) at points (C) and (D).    - The original hypothesis states that the pairs of intersection points (those remaining after inversion) lie on a single line or a circle. 5. **Applying the Conclusion of Inverted Structure:**    Since the initial configuration given by hypothesis tells us that if points (A, B, C, D) lie on one circle or line before inversion, this relation should also hold post-inversion. 6. **Use the given geometric property:**    The transformed points (A, B, C, D) lying on one circle or one line follows from the circular (or linear) nature of the intersection points. If these points lie on a circle, by definition of inversion and due to the nature of geometric inversions preserving such circular incidents, the original set of intersection points must also lie on a single circle or line. 7. **Concluding with the Problem's Assertion:**    Therefore, if the points of intersection of (S_1) with (S_4) and (S_2) with (S_3) are correctly transposed, then they will naturally fall on a single circle or line, proving the given problem. Hence we conclude that the points (A, B, C, D) after inversion lie on a single circle or line, implying the same for the original set of circles and intersection points.

Using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence, the conclusion can be drawn. [Answer] (1) Taking the sequence {a_n} as a constant sequence, for any m, n, s, t in mathbb{N}^*, we have a_m + a_n = a_s + a_t, so this statement is false.

There exist positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) (they can be the same) such that ( f(m+n) neq f(m) + f(n) ). Find the minimum value of ( k ).","output":"\`\`\`markdown Given the problem, we need to find the smallest number k for which there is a valid coloring of the set of positive integers into k colors, along with a function f: mathbb{Z}^{+} rightarrow mathbb{Z}^{+} satisfying the following conditions: 1. For integers m and n of the same color (possibly the same integer), f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n). 2. There are integers m and n such that f(m+n) neq f(m) + f(n). We will show that the smallest value of k is 3. **Step-by-step solution:** 1. **Construction for ( k = 3 ):**    Define the function f as follows:    [    f(n) = begin{cases}     2n & text{if } n equiv 0 pmod{3}     n  & text{if } n equiv 1 text{ or } 2 pmod{3}    end{cases}    ]    This satisfies condition (2), since for example f(1) + f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3 neq f(3) = 6.

[      f(x+y) = x+y = f(x) + f(y)      ]    This construction satisfies condition (1). 2. **Proof that ( k = 2 ) fails:**    Suppose there exists a 2-coloring that satisfies condition (1) but not (2).    Let us assume a function f satisfying condition (1) with the partition of positive integers into two colors. Let ( m ) be any integer, and we analyze:    - If ( m = n ), from (1), we have:      [      f(2n) = 2f(n)      ]    - Using the same logic iteratively for even numbers:      [      f(4n) = 4f(n)      ]    - Consider ( f(6n) = 2f(3n) ):      [      f(3n) = f(2n) + f(n) = 3f(n)      ] 3. **Contradiction with ( k = 2 ):**        Begin by considering ( k = 2 ), and assume the function ( f ) and the partition satisfy condition (1). By considering different possible cases for the parity and coloring of ( m ), we show that:    - If ( m = x ) and ( 2m = 2x ) are the same color:      [      f(3x) = f(2x) + f(x) = 3f(x)      ]    - Suppose ( x ) and ( 2x ) are different colors; however, ( 2x ) and ( 4x ) could be the same or different. We examine all possible cases and always end up with:      [      f(3x) = 3 f(x)      ] 4. **General proof of ( f(n) = n cdot f(1) ):**    Indicate that function ( f ) always satisfies ( f(n) = n cdot f(1) ) under the assumption of 2-coloring. Any inconsistency leads to ( f(m) neq m cdot f(1) ).    This analysis confirms that for ( k = 2 ), suitable conditions cannot be met without contradictions. # Conclusion Therefore, the smallest value of ( k ) that satisfies all conditions of the problem is: [ boxed{3} ] \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Given a point with rectangular coordinates (4, 3, 2) and corresponding spherical coordinates (rho, theta, phi), find the rectangular coordinates of the point with spherical coordinates (rho, theta + pi, phi).","output":"Start with the relationships for the original coordinates: [ begin{align*} 4 &= rho sin phi cos theta,  -3 &= rho sin phi sin theta,  -2 &= rho cos phi. end{align*} ] Calculate rho from the original coordinates: [ rho = sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2 + (-2)^2} = sqrt{16 + 9 + 4} = sqrt{29}. ] Now, since phi rightarrow -phi and theta rightarrow theta + pi, we get these calculations: [ begin{align*} rho sin (-phi) cos (theta + pi) &= -rho sin phi cos theta = -4,  rho sin (-phi) sin (theta + pi) &= -rho sin phi sin theta = 3,  rho cos (-phi) &= rho cos phi = -2. end{align*} ] Thus, the new rectangular coordinates are boxed{(-4, 3, -2)}."},{"instruction":"the Cartesian coordinate system (xOy), it is known that the equation (dfrac{x^{2}}{4m}dfrac{y^{2}}{2+m}=1) represents a hyperbola.

For [a,a+1] to be a trap, all members of the sequence not in [a,a+1] should not be part of infinite members. 4. However, by definition, every feeding interval must include an infinite subset of the sequence. 5. Let’s first assume [a,a+1] doesn’t intersect with the interval [0,1]. 6. If [a,a+1] were a trap, then outside of [a,a+1]—including within the interval [0,1]—there should be only a finite number of sequence members. 7. This implies there only a finite number of sequence elements in [0,1], which contradicts the condition that [0,1] is a feeding interval.

However, frac{1}{a} gt frac{1}{b} can also be true without a and b both being negative (e.g., if a = -2 and b = 1, then frac{1}{a} = -frac{1}{2} and frac{1}{b} = 1, which still satisfies frac{1}{a} gt frac{1}{b} without a lt b lt 0). 3.

This theorem states that a projective transformation (a composition of projections) is the identity transformation if it has three distinct fixed points. 4. **Identifying Fixed Points**:    - Here, we need to identify three distinct fixed points on the line (AB) to show that our composition of projections must be an identity transformation.    - The points (A) and (B) are trivially fixed points because they lie on the intersection of the side (AB) with itself after each set of projections.    - The third fixed point is the point at infinity along the line (AB), since projects along parallel lines in a square must preserve parallelism. This ensures that there is a fixed point at infinity. 5. **Conclusion**:    - Since there are three distinct fixed points (A), (B), and the point at infinity on line (AB), we conclude from Problem 30.4 that the composite transformation of all the described projections is indeed the identity transformation.    - Therefore, after 12 projections, the 13th point (M_{13}) must return to the original point (M_{1}).

The only number in this range that meets this criterion is:    [    2079    ]    since:    [    2079 div 99 = 21,    ]    meaning 2079 is divisible by 99. 4. **Factorize 2079**:    To confirm divisibility by each required factor:    [    2079 = 3^{3} cdot 7 cdot 11    ]    Therefore, 2079 is divisible by 3 (since (3^{3}) is a factor), 7, and 11. 5. **Summing payments for 2079**:    Vasya checks if Petya’s number is divisible by:    - 1 (always true): 1 ruble    - 3: (2079 div 3 = 693)    - 5: Some calculations show it is not divisible by 5    - 7: (2079 div 7 = 297)    - 9: (2079 div 9 = 231)    - 11: (2079 div 11 = 189)    Summing up the rubles for the valid conditions (where there is no decimal division):    [    1 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 31    ] 6. **Maximum rubles comparison**:    If Petya’s number is not divisible by 9 or 11, the total rubles gained would be:    [    1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 27    ]    It's clear (31) rubles is a higher amount compared to (27). # Conclusion: The maximum number of rubles Petya can get is: [ boxed{31} ]"},{"instruction":"A collection of numbered index cards includes one card with a 1 written on it, two cards with a 2, and so forth up to n cards showing an n.

Next, let's find out the percentage increase needed to bring the reduced price back to the original price of 500. After the 300 reduction, the new price of the coat is 500 - 300 = 200. Percentage increase = (Amount to increase / Reduced price) * 100 Percentage increase = (300 / 200) * 100 Percentage increase = 1.5 * 100 Percentage increase = 150% So, a 150% increase is needed to bring the price back to 500.

Speed of Train 1 = 120 m / 5 s = 24 m/s For the second train, which takes 15 seconds to cross a telegraph post, the speed can be calculated in the same way: Speed of Train 2 = 120 m / 15 s = 8 m/s When two trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.

We need to determine which player has a winning strategy.  Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Initial Configuration**:    - Suppose ( n geq 2 ) and initially, there is one pile with ( n ) stones. 2. **Strategy for the First Move**:    - If ( n ) is even, the first player divides the pile into two equal piles of ( n/2 ) stones.    - If ( n ) is odd, the first player divides the pile into three piles: two piles with ( lfloor n/2 rfloor ) stones and one pile with 1 stone. 3. **General Winning Strategy**:    - After the first move, the overall strategy for the first player is to always respond to the second player's move such that all piles (except those with only one stone) can be paired into sets with an equal number of stones.  Detailed Calculation and Rationale: 1. **First Move**:     - Let's assume that the pile initially consists of ( n ) stones.    - Case ( n ) even (( n = 2k )):      [      text{First player splits } n text{ into two equal parts: } k text{ and } k.      ]    - Case ( n ) odd (( n = 2k + 1 )):      [      text{First player splits } n text{ such that } n = k + k + 1.      ] 2. **Subsequent Moves**:     - If it's the second player's turn, any pile he splits will result in piles that the first player can regroup to maintain his advantage.    - Example for ( n ) even:      - Second player splits a pile of ( k ) into ( a ) and ( k-a ).      - First player then splits the other pile of ( k ) similarly to ensure parity and winning the game. 3. **Structure Maintained**:     - The first player's strategy effectively reduces the problem to keeping paired piles symmetric. Following the first player’s move, the configuration allows the first player always to respond in a manner that keeps the number of asymmetric (unpaired) piles manageable.    - By the game's structure, the quantity of piles increases at each move but is kept in check by the first player's symmetrical response.  Conclusion: The first player has a winning strategy by strategically splitting the initial pile into equal or nearly equal smaller piles, thus maintaining control over the game's structure.

The sales in June 2023 were 30,000 items, and in August 2023, the sales were 36,300 items. Since there are two months between June and August, the sales growth can be represented as an increase by a factor of (1+x)^2 over two months.

Similarly, points C and D have the same y-coordinate, so line CD is also parallel to the x-axis.

She stood up with an Ah, and her colleague, who was buried in work, looked up in confusion, then lowered his head again. Everyone was too busy with their endless tasks to care about her emotions. At this moment, it was noon, the warmest time of the day. The bright sunlight spread from outside the window into the room. She touched her face with her hand, feeling as if she had just had a dream! She felt it necessary to take leave and go back to her hometown, a plan she had had for a long time. Since last autumn, when she learned that her father's stroke had worsened, she had planned to go back. But work was just too busy, one task after another, and she couldn't stop. She had to go back no matter what. These days, the news on the internet and on TV had been bombarding her with a story about a nanny murdering her elderly employer, causing her to have nightmares from time to time. The nanny taking care of her father was found through an agency, about fifty years old, with a round face and a pair of clear eyes that didn't quite match her age. It was those smiling eyes that she liked, and with her years of experience in society, she knew that smile was not flattering or servile, but a kind smile that grew from the bottom of her heart. Entrusting a mute, paralyzed old man to someone with such a kind smile, she felt reassured. But now, she doubted her judgment. The old woman on TV looked so honest and innocent, she could hardly believe that such a person could harm someone as easily as killing a mosquito! Finally, she took leave and rushed into the train station without looking back. Sitting in the waiting room, she anxiously watched the hour and minute hands on the round clock at the entrance of the waiting hall for the train. After her mother's death, her father had a stroke, lost his mobility and speech, and since she couldn't take care of him herself, she had to hire a nanny to look after him at home. In the past two years, she had changed jobs, faced more pressure, and seemed to consciously avoid that home where she had relatives but no warmth, until she saw the news about the nanny incident, which made her panic. She thought she should go back and see, if something happened to her father, she would also be an accomplice to the murderer in a way. The journey home was long and winding, the train climbed over mountains and crossed rivers, but the destination seemed far away. A child on his way home asked, Mom, why doesn't the train stand up and run if it's climbing so slowly? She laughed silently in amazement. When she was a child, she also asked her parents many such questions. Even though she didn't get the answers she wanted, her parents always smiled at her kindly, stroked her head, and even gave her a rewarding hug, making her feel that asking some nonsensical questions was a happy thing, even if there were no answers. Getting off the train, her mind was still in a daze. It had been more than two years since she had been back, and the buildings in front of the station, set against the backdrop of new billboards, seemed even more dilapidated. A yellow taxi stopped right beside her. The driver honked the horn, making her feel at a loss, as if she had unexpectedly encountered a friend who was once very familiar but had been distanced by herself. In the car, she tentatively brought up the case of the nanny killing someone. The driver laughed it off, saying that in today's world, anything could happen. Recently, an old man died at home and was only discovered after more than ten days. When they opened the door, the body was already decomposing. She felt a spasm in her stomach, a sour taste in her mouth, wanted to vomit but held it back. She held her head with one hand and turned to look out the window. The old willow trees by the roadside were gone, and the roadside had been paved with cement and tiles into a parking lot. She remembered those old willow trees, and how they brought the news of spring to the people living in this city early in spring! Dragging her luggage, she walked into the community, her heart beating fast with the rolling sound of her suitcase. A little girl holding her mother's hand walked towards her, a fluffy dog following behind, wagging its tail. From dozens of meters away, she saw the old man sitting in the wheelchair. A roundfaced old woman was chatting with someone next to her, the old man sat in the wheelchair, the spring sunshine shining on his dark and somewhat rosy face, he was looking ahead, presumably seeing something that surprised him. His eyes suddenly brightened, a smile slowly appeared on his lips, slowly becoming vivid, until she felt that the smile had spread like the warm sun of spring, making her world warm and vivid as well.

A can do the work in 20 days, which means A's work rate is ( frac{1}{20} ) of the work per day. B can do the work in ( x ) days, which means B's work rate is ( frac{1}{x} ) of the work per day. When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates, which is ( frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{x} ). According to the problem, when they work together, they take 8.571428571428571 days to complete the work. This means their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{8.571428571428571} ) of the work per day. So we can set up the equation: [ frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{x} = frac{1}{8.571428571428571} ] To solve for ( x ), we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation, which is ( 20x ). We rewrite the equation as: [ frac{x}{20x} + frac{20}{20x} = frac{1}{8.571428571428571} ] Simplifying the left side, we get: [ frac{x + 20}{20x} = frac{1}{8.571428571428571} ] Now we can cross-multiply to solve for ( x ): [ (x + 20) cdot 8.571428571428571 = 20x ] [ 8.571428571428571x + 171.4285714285714 = 20x ] Subtract ( 8.571428571428571x ) from both sides: [ 171.4285714285714 = 20x - 8.571428571428571x ] [ 171.4285714285714 = 11.428571428571429x ] Now, divide both sides by ( 11.428571428571429 ) to solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{171.4285714285714}{11.428571428571429} ] [ x = 15 ] So, B can do the work alone in boxed{15}  days."},{"instruction":"There are 5 square pieces of transparent glass, all of the same size.

[    text{Total configurations with a fixed bottom piece} = 4^4 = 256    ] 4. **Considering Different Vertical Arrangements:**    - Any permutation of the 5 glass pieces in the stack is allowed.    - The total number of permutations of 5 glass pieces is (5!):    [    5! = 120    ] 5. **Initial Count of Arrangements:**    - So, considering all permutations and rotations, we have:    [    120 times 256 = 30720    ] 6. **Ensuring Vertical Non-transparency:**    - For a stack to be non-transparent, each of the 4 columns (corresponding to the 4 triangles from each glass piece aligning vertically) must contain at least one painted triangle. 7. **Evaluating Combinations to Ensure Non-transparent Columns:**    - Each column must have one triangle that is rotated (90^circ), (180^circ), and (270^circ). All rotations (90^circ), (180^circ), and (270^circ) must appear at least once.    - We can use combinations of the angles to fill the 4 slots respecting the condition.

This equation comes from considering the peak to trough distance along the y-axis (4 units in total since the amplitude is 2) and the horizontal distance covered in half a period of the sine function. 2. **Solving for omega:** From the spatial distance equation, we simplify and solve for omega.    [    sqrt{4 + left(frac{pi}{omega}right)^2 + 4} = 2sqrt{3} implies sqrt{left(frac{pi}{omega}right)^2 + 8} = 2sqrt{3}    ]    Squaring both sides gives:    [    left(frac{pi}{omega}right)^2 + 8 = 12    ]    Simplifying further:    [    left(frac{pi}{omega}right)^2 = 4 implies frac{pi}{omega} = 2 implies omega = frac{pi}{2}    ] 3. **Modifying the function:** With omega = frac{pi}{2}, the function becomes f(x) = 2sin(frac{pi}{2} x - frac{pi}{6}). 4. **Finding a from the condition f(x) = -1:** The equation f(x) = -1 translates to 2sin(frac{pi}{2} x - frac{pi}{6}) = -1. To have two real roots in the interval (0, a), we analyze the range of frac{pi}{2} x - frac{pi}{6}.    [    -frac{pi}{6} < frac{pi}{2} x - frac{pi}{6} leq frac{api}{2} - frac{pi}{6}    ]    Since sin(theta) = -frac{1}{2} corresponds to theta in [frac{7pi}{6}, frac{11pi}{6}] for any relevant period, we equate frac{api}{2} - frac{pi}{6} to these angles:    [    frac{11pi}{6} < frac{api}{2} - frac{pi}{6} leq frac{19pi}{6}    ]    Solving this inequality for a gives:    [    4 < a leq frac{20}{3}    ] Therefore, the range of the real number a is (4, frac{20}{3}], matching choice **D**.

However, only some people went shopping that day; some people visited more than one store. If 8 people visited exactly two stores each, and everyone visited at least one store, the largest number of stores anyone could have visited is 3. How many people went shopping that day?","output":"Let's denote the total number of people who went shopping that day as P. We know that 8 people visited exactly two stores each. This means these 8 people account for 8 * 2 = 16 visits. Since there were a total of 22 visits to the stores and these 8 people account for 16 of those visits, there are 22 - 16 = 6 visits left to account for. Now, we need to consider the constraint that the largest number of stores anyone could have visited is 3. This means that the remaining visits must be made by people who visited either one store or three stores. Since everyone visited at least one store, let's first consider the possibility that the remaining 6 visits were made by people who each visited one store. This would mean there are 6 additional people, each making 1 visit. However, this would imply that there are 8 (who visited two stores each) + 6 (who visited one store each) = 14 people who went shopping that day. But we need to check if there's a possibility that any of these 6 visits were made by someone visiting 3 stores. Since the maximum number of stores anyone visited is 3, and we have 6 visits left, it's possible that 2 people visited 3 stores each, accounting for all 6 remaining visits. If this is the case, then we would have 8 people (who visited two stores each) + 2 people (who visited three stores each) = 10 people who went shopping that day. Since the question asks for the largest number of stores anyone could have visited, which is boxed{3,}  and we have found a scenario that fits all the given conditions with 10 people, we can conclude that 10 people went shopping that day."},{"instruction":"Given that M(m,n) is any point on the circle C:x^{2}+y^{2}4x14y+45=0, and point Q(2,3).

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 54 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 54 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 54000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 15 m/s Now, when the train passes a man standing on the platform, it only has to cover its own length because the man can be considered as a point relative to the length of the train. When the train passes the entire platform, it has to cover its own length plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the train as L (in meters). When the train passes the man, it covers a distance equal to its own length (L) in 20 seconds. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time For the train passing the man: L = Speed × Time L = 15 m/s × 20 s L = 300 meters Now, when the train passes the platform, it has to cover the length of the platform plus its own length. So the total distance the train covers when passing the platform is: Total distance = Length of the train (L) + Length of the platform Total distance = 300 meters + 300.024 meters Total distance = 600.024 meters Now we can find the time it takes for the train to pass the platform using the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to pass the platform = Total distance / Speed Time to pass the platform = 600.024 m / 15 m/s Time to pass the platform = 40.0016 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{40.0016}  seconds for the train to pass the platform."},{"instruction":"What is the remainder when 5^0 + 5^1 + 5^2 + cdots + 5^{2010} is divided by 8?

The train crosses a tree, which we can consider as a point, in 120 seconds. The length of the train is 1200 meters. Therefore, the speed of the train (v) can be calculated using the formula: v = distance / time Here, the distance is the length of the train, which is 1200 meters, and the time is 120 seconds. v = 1200 meters / 120 seconds v = 10 meters/second Now, to find out how long it will take to pass the 800-meter-long platform, we need to consider the total distance the train will cover when passing the platform.

This shows that if A cap B = A, then it is sufficient to conclude complement_U B subseteq complement_U A. 2. **Necessity**: Now, let's assume complement_U B subseteq complement_U A. This means that any element not in B is also not in A. By understanding the complements, this implies A subseteq B.

We consider all combinations:    - If (a^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}) and (b^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}), then:      [      0 + 0 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{4}      ]      This implies (c^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}), so (c equiv 1 pmod{4}) or (c equiv 3 pmod{4}).    - If (a^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}) and (b^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}), then:      [      0 + 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4}      ]      This is not possible since (c^2) cannot be 2 modulo 4.    - If (a^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}) and (b^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}), then:      [      1 + 0 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4}      ]      This is not possible since (c^2) cannot be 2 modulo 4.    - If (a^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}) and (b^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}), then:      [      1 + 1 + 1 equiv 3 pmod{4}      ]      This implies (c^2 equiv 3 pmod{4}), which is not possible since (c^2) can only be 0 or 1 modulo 4.    Therefore, the only valid case is when (a^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}) and (b^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}), which implies (a) and (b) are even. 3. **Expressing (a) and (c):**    Let (a = 2alpha) and (b = 2beta). Then:    [    (2alpha)^2 + (2beta)^2 + 1 = c^2 implies 4alpha^2 + 4beta^2 + 1 = c^2    ]    This implies:    [    c^2 = 4(alpha^2 + beta^2) + 1    ]    Let (c = 2k + 1) (since (c) must be odd to satisfy the equation). 4. **Calculating the floor functions:**    We need to show that (leftlfloor frac{a}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{c}{2} rightrfloor) is even:    [    leftlfloor frac{a}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{2alpha}{2} rightrfloor = alpha    ]    [    leftlfloor frac{c}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{2k + 1}{2} rightrfloor = k    ]    Therefore:    [    leftlfloor frac{a}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{c}{2} rightrfloor = alpha + k    ] 5. **Analyzing the parity of (alpha + k):**    Since (a) and (b) are even, (alpha) and (beta) are integers. From the equation (4alpha^2 + 4beta^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2), we know that (k) is an integer.     We need to show that (alpha + k) is even. Since (a) and (b) are even, (alpha) is an integer. The parity of (k) depends on the parity of (alpha) and (beta).     If (alpha) is even, then (k) must be even to satisfy the equation. If (alpha) is odd, then (k) must be odd. In both cases, (alpha + k) is even.

The tangent to ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ) intersects the line segment ( AC ) at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). To prove:  We need to show that the tangent to circle ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ) intersects line ( AC ) at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). 1. **Identify Key Points and Circles:**    Let's introduce the points and circles more formally:    - ( w_1 ): A circle with some center ( O ).    - ( w_2 ): The second circle with center ( U ).    - ( Y ): The intersection of circle ( w_1 ) with the median ( BM ).    - ( K ) and ( L ): Points on line ( AC ). 2. **Positioning the Center ( U ):**    Observing the circles, the center ( U ) of the second circle ( w_2 ) lies at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). 3. **Symmetry of the Problem:**    Given that point ( Y ) lies on the second circle ( w_2 ), we need to show that segment ( UK ) is tangent to the first circle ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ), making circles ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) orthogonal. 4. **Orthogonality Conditions for Circles:**    Two circles are orthogonal if the radius of one at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the radius of the other. Specifically,     - ( w_1 perp w_2 ) implies that the radius from the center ( O ) of ( w_1 ) to the tangency point ( Y ) is perpendicular to the radius from ( U ) (center of ( w_2 )) to ( Y ). 5. **Inversion Property:**    To show orthogonality through inversion, we utilize the following property:        - A circle remains invariant (unchanged) in position under an inversion with respect to another circle if the two circles are orthogonal. 6. **Geometric Analysis of Points L and L’:**    Consider point ( L ) on ( AC ) and its inverse point ( L' ) with respect to circle ( w_1 ). The angles are preserved under inversion, thus     [    angle AL'L = angle OAL    ]    Similarly,     [    angle OCL = angle OL'C    ]    Therefore, ( L'L ) bisects ( A L'C ), making:    [    frac{AL'}{L'C} = frac{AL}{LC}    ]    This implies ( L' ) lies on the Apollonian circle defined by points ( A, C ) and the segment ( KL ). # Conclusion: By proving the segment ( UK ) is tangent to circle ( w_1 ) at ( Y ) and that ( L' ) lies on an Apollonian circle, we have shown the desired symmetry and tangency properties. Hence, the orthogonality condition ( w_1 perp w_2 ) is satisfied. This demonstrates that the tangent at the point of intersection with the median does indeed bisect the segment ( KL ) at its midpoint. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Aunt Beatrice is 54 years old.

A practical method to approximate the circle’s circumference can be to construct a polygon inscribed in the circle whose perimeter is close to the actual circumference.  3. Consider a rectangle where one side is the diameter of the circle, and the other side is three times this diameter. The diagonal of this rectangle provides a useful approximation. 4.

The diagonal ( D ) of this rectangle can be calculated by applying the Pythagorean theorem:    [    D = sqrt{d^2 + (3d)^2} = sqrt{d^2 + 9d^2} = sqrt{10d^2} = dsqrt{10}    ] 6. The ratio of this approximation to the diameter is:    [    frac{D}{d} = sqrt{10} approx 3.1622    ] Hence, the approximate value of ( pi ) we get from this method is:    [    pi approx sqrt{10} approx 3.1622    ] 7.

How long does it take for the train to pass through the tunnel from the moment the front enters to the moment the rear emerges?","output":"To calculate the time it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel, we need to consider the length of the train and the length of the tunnel. The train needs to cover the distance equal to the length of the tunnel plus its own length to completely emerge from the tunnel. The length of the tunnel is 3 1/2 miles, which is 3.5 miles. The length of the train is 1/4 mile, which is 0.25 miles. The total distance the train needs to cover to completely emerge from the tunnel is the sum of these two lengths: Total distance = Length of tunnel + Length of train Total distance = 3.5 miles + 0.25 miles Total distance = 3.75 miles The speed of the train is 75 mph. To find the time it takes to travel this distance, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 3.75 miles / 75 mph Now, we calculate the time: Time = 3.75 / 75 Time = 0.05 hours To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time in minutes = 0.05 hours * 60 minutes/hour Time in minutes = 3 minutes Therefore, it takes the train boxed{3}  minutes to pass through the tunnel from the moment the front enters to the moment the rear emerges."},{"instruction":"A machine processes a positive integer ( N ) according to the following modified rule:  If ( N ) is odd, the output ( O = 2N + 2 ).

When k=0, the inequality reduces to - frac {3}{8} < 0, which is always true. However, since k cannot be exactly zero (otherwise the expression would not be a quadratic inequality), this case does not contribute to the solution set. 2. When kneq 0, for the inequality 2kx^{2}+kx- frac {3}{8} < 0 to hold for all x, the quadratic must open downwards and never touch or cross the x-axis, which means the discriminant must be negative. Using the standard form of a quadratic, ax^{2}+bx+c, we require b^{2}-4ac<0. For our inequality, we have a = 2k, b = k, and c = -frac {3}{8}. We find the discriminant: Delta = b^{2}-4ac = k^{2}-4(2k)left(-frac {3}{8}right) = k^{2}+frac {3k}{2}. Setting the discriminant less than zero to ensure that the quadratic has no real roots: k^{2}+frac {3k}{2} < 0. Next, solve the inequality: 2k^{2}+3k < 0. Factoring out k: k(2k+3) < 0. Here, the critical points are k = 0 and k = -frac {3}{2}, which divide the number line into intervals. Using a test point, we find that the inequality is satisfied for -frac {3}{2} < k < 0. Combining the results from both cases, we conclude that the inequality 2kx^{2}+kx- frac {3}{8} < 0 is true for all x when: -frac {3}{2} < k < 0. However, since the inequality must hold for all x, including x=0, we can conclude that k must be different from zero. Therefore, we can include the end-point -frac {3}{2} since the coefficient 2k would still be negative and the inequality would be satisfied.

Prove that ( a^{n} + 1 ) can only be a prime number if ( a ) is even and ( n ) is some power of 2.","output":"1. **Preliminary Analysis**:    We start by noting that a and n are positive integers with a > 1. Thus, a^n + 1 geq a + 1 > 2.     [    a^n + 1 geq a + 1 > 2    ]    This tells us that a^n + 1 is greater than 2, and therefore, if it is a prime number, it must be an odd prime. 2. **Conditions for a**:    Since a^n + 1 must be odd to possibly be prime, and a + 1 > 2 implies a^n + 1 is odd, it follows that a must be even. Let a = 2k for some integer k. 3. **Analyzing n**:    We further investigate the form of n. If n is not a power of 2, then n has an odd divisor p other than 1. We can express n in the form:    [    n = 2^k p    ]    where k is a non-negative integer and p is an odd integer. 4. **Expressing a^n + 1**:    Next, we express a^n + 1 using the above form of n:    [    a^n + 1 = a^{2^k p} + 1 = left(a^{2^k}right)^p + 1    ]    This expression left(a^{2^k}right)^p + 1 involves a sum of two terms, left(a^{2^k}right)^p and 1, where both are odd since a^{2^k} is necessarily even when a is even. 5. **Divisibility Argument**:    Knowing p is odd, we appeal to the properties of sums of odd powers. A key algebraic fact is that if we have two odd numbers x and y, then x^p + y^p (where p is an odd integer) is divisible by x + y. Thus,     [    left(a^{2^k}right)^p + 1^p    ]    is divisible by a^{2^k} + 1. Therefore, a^n + 1 is divisible by a^{2^k} + 1, implying that     [    a^n + 1 > a^{2^k} + 1 > a + 1 > 2    ]    which contradicts the assumption that a^n + 1 is a prime number unless n is a power of 2, making p = 1. 6. **Conclusion for n**:    If n = 2^m for some non-negative integer m, then it avoids the contradiction.

Let the smaller rectangle have side lengths 2ax and 2bx, where 0 < x leq 1.  For the smaller rectangle, since two vertices lie on the circle, the diagonal of the smaller rectangle must also be a diameter of the circle.

Additionally, we have two points A and B on the parabola such that the sum of their distances to the focus F is 6. We need to find the distance from the midpoint of segment AB to the y-axis. **Step 1: Determine the coordinates of the focus F.** The focus of a parabola y^{2}=2px is at F(frac{p}{2}, 0).  **Step 2: Calculate the minimum distance PF.** For any point P(x_{0}, y_{0}) on the parabola, where x_{0}geqslant 0, the distance PF can be calculated as follows: [ PF^{2} = left(x_{0}-frac{p}{2}right)^{2} + y_{0}^{2} = left(x_{0}-frac{p}{2}right)^{2} + 2px_{0} = left(x_{0}+frac{p}{2}right)^{2} ] Given that the minimum value of PF is 1, we set the minimum of left(x_{0}+frac{p}{2}right)^{2} to be 1^{2} = 1. This implies: [ left(frac{p}{2}right)^{2} = 1 Rightarrow p = 2 ] Thus, the equation of the parabola becomes y^{2}=4x. **Step 3: Determine the coordinates of points A and B.** Given the parabola y^{2}=4x, points A and B on this parabola can be represented as Aleft(frac{y_{1}^{2}}{4}, y_{1}right) and Bleft(frac{y_{2}^{2}}{4}, y_{2}right). **Step 4: Calculate the distance from the midpoint of AB to the y-axis.** The midpoint of AB has coordinates left(frac{y_{1}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}}{8}, frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}right).

According to the information given, Joan paid 158 for her telescope. The sum of their purchases was 400, so we can write the following equation: K + 158 = 400 To find the value of K, we subtract 158 from both sides of the equation: K = 400 - 158 K = 242 Now, we are told that Joan paid 74 more than Karl when doubled. This means that if we double Karl's payment, Joan's payment will be 74 more than that. So we can write another equation: 2K + 74 = 158 We already know that K is 242, so we can substitute that into the equation: 2 * 242 + 74 = 158 This equation doesn't seem to be correct because the left side of the equation will be greater than 158. Let's re-evaluate the information given. If Joan paid 74 more than Karl when doubled, it means: 2K + 74 = 2 * Joan's payment Since Joan's payment is 158, we can write: 2K + 74 = 2 * 158 2K + 74 = 316 Now, we can solve for K: 2K = 316 - 74 2K = 242 K = 242 / 2 K = 121 So, Karl paid 121 for his telescope. Now, we can find the ratio of what Joan paid to what Karl paid: Joan's payment : Karl's payment = 158 : 121 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor.

Prove that at least three of these nine lines pass through a single point.","output":"1. **Understanding the Basic Geometry and Constraints:**     - Consider a square being intersected by 9 lines.      - Each line should divide the square into two quadrilaterals.     - The areas of these quadrilaterals are in the ratio 2:3. 2. **Analyzing the Path of Each Line:**     - If a straight line intersects two adjacent sides of a square, it produces a triangle and a pentagon when cutting the square. However, the problem specifies that each line must produce two quadrilaterals, so such intersections cannot occur.     - Therefore, every line must intersect two opposite sides of the square. This division forms two trapezoids (or potentially two rectangles). 3. **Properties of the Trapezoids:**     - Given the ratio of areas is 2:3, the lengths of the segments of the \\"middle line\\" (which runs parallel to the sides of the square and midway between them) are also in the 2:3 ratio.     - The \\"middle line\\" of the square thus has two specific points dividing it in a 2:3 ratio.     4. **Finding Key Points for Intersections:**     - For each pair of opposite sides of the square, intersection by a straight line at points dividing the middle line in a 2:3 ratio will satisfy the problem conditions.     - Consider the middle line parallel to each set of opposite sides. There will be four key points in total (two for each middle line), where these lines intersecting the square must pass through. 5. **Ensuring Three Lines Pass Through One Point:**     - Given that there are 9 lines, we want to show that at least three of these lines intersect at one of the four key points on the square's middle lines.     - If each point were used by at most two lines, that would accommodate at most (2 cdot 4 = 8) lines.     - However, the total number of lines is 9, thus forcing at least one of the key points to be traversed by at least 3 lines. 6. **Conclusion:**     - Therefore, by geometric constraints and area ratios, we have at least three out of these nine lines intersecting at one of the four key points.

For example, numbers like 11, 22, 101, etc., will be erased. 3. **Effect of Decreasing by 1**:    - After each step, every integer in the list is decreased by 1. This means that the list will eventually contain nonpositive integers, which will be erased. 4. **Key Observation**:    - The critical observation is to determine the maximum number of steps it takes for any integer to be erased.    - Consider the number 10. It will be decreased to 9, 8, 7, ..., 1, 0, and then -1. This process takes exactly 11 steps. 5. **Erasure of Numbers with Repeated Digits**:    - Numbers like 11, 22, 33, ..., 99, 101, 111, etc., will be erased as soon as they appear in the list.    - For example, 11 will be erased in the first step, 22 in the second step, and so on. 6. **General Case**:    - For any number ( n ) in the list, if it does not have repeated digits, it will be decreased step by step until it becomes nonpositive.    - The maximum number of steps required for any number to become nonpositive is determined by the number 10, which takes 11 steps. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Since the number 10 takes exactly 11 steps to be erased, and all other numbers will be erased in fewer or equal steps, the entire list will be empty after 11 steps.

First, consider the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to ( n ): [ N(1)=1^2+2^2+cdots+n^2 ] 3. **Sum of Squares of Multiples**: For any divisor ( k ) of ( n ), let ( N(k) ) denote the sum of squares of numbers up to ( n ) that are multiples of ( k ): [ N(k) = k^2 + (2k)^2 + cdots + left(frac{n}{k}right)^2k^2 = k^2 left(1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + left(frac{n}{k}right)^2right) ] 4. **Sum of \\"First ( x ) Squares\\"**: Use the known formula for the sum of squares of the first ( x ) positive integers: [ 1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + x^2 = frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6} ] Applying this to ( N(k) ): [ N(k) = k^2 cdot frac{left(frac{n}{k}right) left(frac{n}{k} + 1right) left(2 cdot frac{n}{k} + 1right)}{6} = k^2 cdot frac{left(n/kright) left(n/k + 1right) left(2n/k + 1right)}{6} ] Simplify the right-hand side: [ N(k) = frac{n^3}{3k} + frac{n^2}{2} + frac{nk}{6} ] 5. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: Apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the sum of squares of numbers up to ( n ) that are relatively prime to ( n ): [ begin{aligned} N^{*} = &  N(1) - N(p_{1}) - N(p_{2}) - cdots - N(p_{t})  & + N(p_{1}p_{2}) + cdots + left(-1right)^t N(p_{1} p_{2} cdots p_{t}) end{aligned} ] 6. **Substituting ( N(k) )**: Substitute the formula for ( N(k) ) into this expression: [ begin{aligned} N^{*} = & frac{n^3}{3}left(1 - frac{1}{p_{1}} - frac{1}{p_{2}} - cdots - frac{1}{p_{t}} + frac{1}{p_{1} p_{2}} + cdots + left(-1right)^t frac{1}{p_{1} p_{2} cdots p_{t}}right)  & + frac{n^2}{2}left(1 - binom{t}{1} + binom{t}{2} - cdots + left(-1right)^t binom{t}{t}right)  & + frac{n}{6}left(1 - p_{1} - p_{2} - cdots - p_{t} + p_{1}p_{2} + cdots + left(-1right)^t left(p_{1} p_{2} cdots p_{t}right)right) end{aligned} ] 7. **Simplifications**:    - The binomial coefficients produce an oscillating sum equal to zero:    [    1 - binom{t}{1} + binom{t}{2} - cdots = 0    ]    - The remaining sums simplify to products:    [    N^{*} = frac{n}{3}left(n^2 + frac{1}{2}left(-1right)^t p_{1} p_{2} cdots (1 - frac{1}{p_{t}})(1 - frac{1}{p_{2}}) cdots (1 - frac{1}{p_{1}})right)    ] 8. **Euler’s Totient**: Recall Euler’s Totient Function ( varphi(n) ) relation:    [    m = varphi(n) = n left(1 - frac{1}{p_{1}}right)left(1 - frac{1}{p_{2}}right) cdots left(1 - frac{1}{p_{t}}right)    ] Combining all these, we get: [ N^{*} = frac{m}{3}left(n^2 + frac{1}{2}left(-1right)^t p_{1} p_{2} cdots p_{t}right) ] Thus, we conclude: [ boxed{r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}+cdots+r_{m}^{2}=frac{m}{3}left(n^{2}+frac{1}{2}(-1)^{t} p_{1} p_{2} ldots p_{t}right)} ]"},{"instruction":"how many different ways can eight people line up to buy a ticket from a single window at a movie theater?","output":"We need to find the number of permutations of 8 different people.

For example, we can take ( X_k = [u - frac{1}{k}, u + frac{1}{k}] ). 4. **Analyze the images of these intervals under ( f ):**    By the given property of ( f ), ( f(X_i) ) is closed and bounded for all ( i ), and ( f(X_i) supseteq f(X_k) ) for ( i < k ).

Since ( f ) maps closed intervals to closed intervals, and the intervals ( f(X_i) ) are nested, the intersection (cap_{k=1}^{infty} f(X_k)) is non-empty and closed. By the properties of ( f ), this intersection must be ({f(u)}). 6. **Use the definition of continuity:**    Let ( U ) be a closed interval containing ( f(u) ). Since (cap_{k=1}^{infty} f(X_k) = {f(u)}), there exists some ( k ) such that ( f(X_k) subset U ). This means that for the closed interval ( X_k ) around ( u ), the images of the elements of ( X_k ) are in ( U ). 7. **Conclude the continuity:**    Since for any (epsilon > 0), we can find a closed interval ( X_k ) around ( u ) such that ( f(X_k) subset [f(u) - epsilon, f(u) + epsilon] ), it follows that ( f ) is continuous at ( u ).

Since the polynomial is of degree four, it can have at most four roots. Therefore, we deduce that some values of x must use the same condition (either 6 or -6) more than once.  Given that the polynomial is fourth-degree, we consider five points where the magnitude of the polynomial equals 6. As in the original problem, we infer that between g(x) = 6 and g(x) = -6, one of these will correspond to three values and the other to two values.  Define a new polynomial h(x) = g(x) - 6 with three roots and h(x) = g(x) + 6 with two roots. Assume without loss of generality that g(0) = g(3) = g(4) = 6 and g(1) = g(5) = -6 (these assignments meet the condition since f(x) = 6 or -6 for three values and two values respectively). Thus, h(x) = k(x)(x-1)(x-5) because h(1) = h(5) = 0. We solve for k using the fact that g(0) = 6, which leads to:  [ 0 = k(0 - 1)(0 - 5) + 6 = -5k + 6.] [ k = frac{6}{5}.] So, h(x) = frac{6}{5} x(x-1)(x-5), and g(x) = frac{6}{5} x(x-1)(x-5) + 6.

The speed of the jogger is 9 km/hr, and the speed of the train is 45 km/hr. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the jogger's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed: Relative speed of the train with respect to the jogger = Speed of train - Speed of jogger Relative speed = 45 km/hr - 9 km/hr Relative speed = 36 km/hr To convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s: Relative speed in m/s = 36 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed in m/s = 10 m/s The train needs to cover the initial 190 m gap plus the entire length of the train (120 m) to pass the jogger completely.

Each day, 4 games are played involving all 8 grandmasters in such a way that every pair meets exactly once over the course of the tournament. 2. **Identify Cycles Leading to Empty Days 6 and 7 for Certain Players:**    Since every pair of players faces each other exactly once, we can define cycles for the players to understand how match-ups occur. Consider the following definitions:    - Let A_{1} be a grandmaster who plays against B_{1} on day 6.    - On day 7, B_{1} plays against A_{2}.    - A_{2} then plays against another player, denoted as B_{2}, on day 6.    - This process continues, establishing a cycle where A_{n} and B_{n} are opponents on days 6 or 7. 3. **Form Cycles Based on Match Days:**    The sequences can be described as follows:    [    A_{1} xrightarrow{6} B_{1} xrightarrow{7} A_{2} xrightarrow{6} B_{2} xrightarrow{7} cdots xrightarrow{6} B_{n-1} xrightarrow{7} A_{n} xrightarrow{6} B_{n} xrightarrow{7} A_{1}    ] 4. **Checking if Internal Meetings Occur within First Five Days:**    Let's analyze the above scenarios in different potential cycles.

Consequently, their internal matches must have been completed within the first 5 days.    - **Situation 2:** Creates an unmet requirement and doesn't fit the allowed game structure, as it necessitates pairing left over after schedule.    - **Situation 3:** This is a valid cycle similar to situation 1, which confirms remaining internal matches among plotted cycles be completed externally within the permitted structure at start. 6. **Conclusion:** Given the above analysis, by exclusion/existence proof of cycles and timeline segregation, it becomes evident that:     - For any viable sets owing to completeness criteria, consistent cycle players including subsets  {A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}}, {A_{1}, A_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}}, {B_{1}, B_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}}, and {B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}} fulfill criteria without internal-day-6/7 interruptions implying finish sets complete by day 5.

Starting with the provided equation: [ 3 cdot 4^{(x-2)} + 27 = a + a cdot 4^{(x-2)} ] 2. We can group terms involving ( 4^{(x-2)} ) together: [ 3 cdot 4^{(x-2)} - a cdot 4^{(x-2)} = a - 27 ] 3. Factoring out ( 4^{(x-2)} ) from the left-hand side: [ (3 - a) cdot 4^{(x-2)} = a - 27 ] 4. To isolate ( 4^{(x-2)} ), we divide both sides by ( (3 - a) ): [ 4^{(x-2)} = frac{a - 27}{3 - a} ] 5. Next, we recognize that for ( 4^{(x-2)} ) to be valid, the right-hand side must be positive: [ frac{a - 27}{3 - a} > 0 ] 6. Let us analyze the inequality ( frac{a - 27}{3 - a} > 0 ) using interval testing. We examine the zeros of the numerator and the denominator:    - The numerator ( a - 27 = 0 ) when ( a = 27 ).    - The denominator ( 3 - a = 0 ) when ( a = 3 ). 7. These critical points divide the real line into three intervals: ( (-infty, 3) ), ( (3, 27) ), and ( (27, infty) ). We test a value from each interval:     - For ( a < 3 ): Suppose ( a = 2 ):       [ frac{2 - 27}{3 - 2} = frac{-25}{1} = -25 < 0 ]     - For ( 3 < a < 27 ): Suppose ( a = 15 ):       [ frac{15 - 27}{3 - 15} = frac{-12}{-12} = 1 > 0 ]     - For ( a > 27 ): Suppose ( a = 30 ):       [ frac{30 - 27}{3 - 30} = frac{3}{-27} = -frac{1}{9} < 0 ] 8. From the above testing, we see that the expression ( frac{a - 27}{3 - a} ) is positive only in the interval ( (3, 27) ). 9. Given ( 4^{(x-2)} = frac{a-27}{3-a} ), we take the logarithm base 4 of both sides: [ log_4 4^{(x-2)} = log_4 left( frac{a - 27}{3 - a} right) ] 10. Using the property of logarithms, ( log_b (b^c) = c ), we have: [ x - 2 = log_4 left( frac{a-27}{3-a} right) ] 11.

Prove that if a person wants to tour the castle, visiting each hall no more than once, they will be able to see no more than 91 halls. b) Each side of an equilateral triangle is divided into k equal parts. Lines are drawn through the division points parallel to the sides. As a result, the triangle is divided into k^{2} small triangles. A chain is defined as a sequence of small triangles where no triangle appears more than once, and each subsequent triangle shares a side with the previous one. What is the maximum possible number of small triangles in a chain?","output":"Part (a) 1. Consider an equilateral triangle with side length of 100 meters. 2. The triangle is divided into 100 smaller equilateral triangles, each with side length of 10 meters since frac{100}{10} = 10. 3. To create these 100 smaller triangles, each side of the large triangle is divided into 10 equal segments. 4. Each smaller triangle shares its sides with neighboring triangles, and each side has a length of 10 meters. 5. Each room has a door in the center of its shared walls, allowing passage from one room to another directly. 6. Color the smaller triangles alternatingly in two colors, similar to a checkerboard pattern.    - Since the triangle has 10 times 10 = 100 smaller triangles, there will be an imbalance by one color.    - Without loss of generality, assume there are k more triangles of the dominant color (e.g., black). 7. An individual trying to visit each room without revisiting any must traverse through a series of triangles forming a path. 8. If starting from a room of one color, moving to a neighboring room means alternating colors, thus ensuring traversal doesn't repeat colors in a correctly colored bipartite graph. 9. Given the bipartite nature, longest possible path visiting each room without repeating at most would be visiting all but one in one color. 10. The dominant color has frac{100+10}{2} = 55 rooms, while the other has frac{100-10}{2} = 45 rooms. 11. This implies that one can only visit 100 - 1 = 99 rooms at most within the valid path (leaving one room of the dominant color unvisited). Hence, 99 is an overestimate due to doors' constraints and shared walls. Conclusion: thus the traversable number of rooms at most is ( boxed{91} ). The solution holds valid upon verifying specifics regarding room transitions and exploring the adjacency of smaller triangle paths under logical constraints.  Part (b) 1. Divide each side of an equilateral triangle into ( k ) equal parts. 2. Draw lines through division points parallel to the triangle's sides, creating ( k^2 ) smaller equilateral triangles. 3. Color the smaller triangles in a checkerboard manner, with two colors alternatingly, resulting into approximately equal number of triangles for both colors, hence imbalance in coloring leads black (or dominant color) ( k ) triangles more than white. 4. Total black triangles: ( frac{1}{2}(k^2 + k) ). 5. Total white triangles: ( frac{1}{2}(k^2 - k) ). 6. The sequence alternately colored ensures that if maximizing visits, the maximum possible number of triangles in the chain won’t exceed one more than half the sum of squares due to necessary alternation: 7. Following the logical mathematical progression, even color allocation leads: [ frac{1}{2}(k^2 - k + 1)  ] 8. Therefore, additional steps warranted through combinatoric proof: 9.

Since the function f(x) has no extreme points on mathbb{R}, it follows that -a-1=-1, solving this gives a=0. At this point, f(x)=(x^{2}+1)e^{x}, and thus g(x)=ln f(x)+(m-1)x=ln (x^{2}+1)+x+(m-1)x=mx+ln (x^{2}+1). The derivative of g(x) is g'(x)=m+ frac{2x}{x^{2}+1}= frac{mx^{2}+2x+m}{x^{2}+1}.

Therefore, h(x) > h(0)=0, that is, e^{x} > x+1. Since xin(-1,+infty), it follows that x+1 > 0. Also, when ain(-2, frac{1}{2}), r(x)=x^{2}+ax+1 > 0. In fact, r_{text{min}}=r(-frac{a}{2})=1-frac{a^{2}}{4} > 0. To prove the original inequality, it suffices to prove the inequality x^{2}+ax+1 > a, that is, x^{2}+ax+1-a > 0. In fact, let varphi(x)=x^{2}+ax+1-a, xin(-1,+infty). Since a < frac{1}{2}, the axis of symmetry of the quadratic function varphi(x) is x=-frac{a}{2} > -frac{1}{4} > -1. Therefore, varphi_{text{min}}=varphi(-frac{a}{2})=-frac{a^{2}}{4}-a+1. Let t(a)=-frac{a^{2}}{4}-a+1=-frac{1}{4}(a+2)^{2}+2, t(a) is monotonically decreasing with respect to a in (-2, frac{1}{2}). Therefore, t(a) > t(frac{1}{2})=frac{7}{16} > 0, so varphi_{text{min}} > 0.

Let’s analyze the numbers directly under (M_n) in row (n+1). Let these numbers be (a) and (b) with (a > b). 3. **Relation Between Numbers:**        By the problem definition, we have:        [    |a - b| = M_n implies a - b = M_n    ]        Hence,        [    a = M_n + b    ] 4. **Inequalities Across Rows:**        Since (a leq M_{n+1}) and (b geq m_{n+1}), it follows:        [    M_{n+1} geq M_n + m_{n+1}    ]        Applying this iteratively down to the base row:        [    M_{j} geq M_{i} + sum_{k=i+1}^{j} m_k    ]        Consequently, starting from (M_1 = m_1), for the last row (k = 2018), we have:        [    M_{2018} geq sum_{k=1}^{2018} m_k    ] 5. **Summation Bound:**    Since (M_{2018}) is the largest number in the 2018th row, it can be at least the sum of the numbers in all preceding rows. Therefore:    [    M_{2018} geq sum_{k=1}^{2018} m_k    ]        This implies:        [    M_{2018} geq sum_{k=1}^{2018} k = frac{2018 times 2019}{2} = 2037171    ] 6. **Implication of Maximum Bound:**    Therefore, (M_{2018}) must equal the sum of the first 2018 terms:    [    M_{2018} = 2037171    ]        This means that the sequence ({m_1, m_2, ldots, m_{2018}}) must be a permutation of ({1, 2, ldots, 2018}). 7. **Analysis of Small and Large Numbers:**    Define \\"small\\" numbers as numbers in the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2018}) and \\"large\\" numbers as those in the set ({2019, 2020, ldots, 2037171}). 8. **Contradiction through Row Containment:**    Since every possible small number must appear in the anti-Pascal triangle and every row must contain exactly one small number due to uniqueness and distribution rules, we get a contradiction if there are more than (2018) rows. 9. **Proving Inconsistency:**    For (M_{1955}), and continuing to (M_{2017}), if (M_{n-1} geq M_n + m_{n+1}) holds consistently, there cannot be enough numbers to satisfy both the small and the large constraints, proving the impossibility of maintaining the rule for 2018 rows. # Conclusion Thus, an anti-Pascal triangle with 2018 rows containing all integers from 1 to ((1 + 2 + ldots + 2018)) inclusively, cannot exist.

Hence, 99 is not prime.    - **98**:   - Divisible by (2). Hence, 98 is not prime.    - **97**:   - Divisors to check: (2, 3, 5, 7) (all primes less than (sqrt{97}approx9.8)).   - None of these divide 97. Hence, 97 is prime. Thus, the largest prime number less than 100 is 97. # Conclusion: The prime numbers greater than 40 and less than 50 are (41, 43, 47), and the largest prime number less than 100 is (97).

The problem simplifies to finding how the product of these paths give a multiple of 4. For each bottom circle labeled as either 0 or 2, the maximum product at any circle in any row will either be 0 (if any of the underlying circles are 0) or a power of 2. The top circle, therefore, is influenced directly by the product of all possible combinations of paths from the bottom row circles to the top: x_0 times x_{11} times prod_{i=1}^{10} x_i^{{11 choose i}}.  We need this product to be a multiple of 4. Since each x_i is either 0 or 2, this can only occur if at least two of the x_i values are 2 (since 2^2 = 4 and any higher product of 2s is also a multiple of 4), or all are 0. Calculating combinations: 1. All x_i = 0: 1 way. 2.

Apply this identity to our inequality:    [    left( x + 2y - 1 right) left((x - 2y)^{2} + (2y + 1)^{2} + (x + 1)^{2}right) geqslant 0    ]    Since ((x - 2y)^{2}, (2y + 1)^{2},) and ((x + 1)^{2}) are squares, they are always non-negative and:    [    (x - 2y)^{2} + (2y + 1)^{2} + (x + 1)^{2} geqslant 0    ] 4. From this, the condition that must be satisfied is:    [    x + 2y - 1 geqslant 0    ] 5. Next, we find the minimum distance from the origin ((0, 0)) to the line ( x + 2y - 1 = 0 ). The distance ( d ) from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to the line (Ax + By + C = 0) is given by:    [    d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}    ] 6. Apply this formula to our specific line ( x + 2y - 1 = 0 ) with (A = 1, B = 2, C = -1) and the origin ((0,0)):    [    d = frac{|1 cdot 0 + 2 cdot 0 - 1|}{sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = frac{|-1|}{sqrt{1 + 4}} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}    ] 7.

Thus, the coordinates of the center of C are (3, 0). The radius r of the circle is 1. Since the line y = kx is tangent to the circle and the tangent point is in the fourth quadrant, the distance d from the center of the circle to the tangent line must be equal to the circle's radius r. This distance d from the point (3, 0) to the line y = kx is given by  d = frac {|3k|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}}.

The number is 707,!340 + 10d + 4e. Let the alternating sum be (7 + 7 + 4) - (d + 3 + e) = 18 - (d + 3 + e), which must be divisible by 17.

This inequality splits into two cases: - When 4-x > 6, which simplifies to x < -2. - When 4-x < -6, which simplifies to x > 10. Therefore, the set A of all x that satisfy neg p is A = {x | x > 10 text{ or } x < -2}. 2. **Understanding q:** Given q: x^2 - 2x + 1 - a^2 geqslant 0, we recognize this as a quadratic inequality. The expression can be rewritten as (x-1)^2 - a^2 geqslant 0, which factors into (x - (1+a))(x - (1-a)) geqslant 0. This implies that x geqslant 1+a or x leqslant 1-a. Thus, the set B of all x that satisfy q is B = {x | x geqslant 1+a text{ or } x leqslant 1-a}. 3. **Connecting neg p and q:** Since neg p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q, it means every element in set A must also be in set B, or A subset B. This leads to the conditions: - 1-a geqslant -2 to ensure the lower bound of B encompasses the lower bound of A. - 1+a leqslant 10 to ensure the upper bound of B encompasses the upper bound of A. - Additionally, we are given that a > 0. 4. **Solving for a:** From 1-a geqslant -2, we get a leqslant 3. From 1+a leqslant 10, we get a leqslant 9, which is already satisfied by the previous condition. Considering a > 0, we combine these to find the range of a. Therefore, the range of a is 0 < a leqslant 3.  Hence, the answer is boxed{(0,3]}."},{"instruction":"There are 9 oak trees currently in the park . Park workers are planting 2 new oak trees.

This means that for any two distinct elements in ( A ), their product should not be an element of ( A ). 3. **Constructing the Subset:**    To maximize the size of ( A ), we need to carefully select elements such that their products do not fall within the set. One way to ensure this is to avoid including any small numbers that could multiply to form other numbers within the set. 4. **Eliminating Numbers:**    Consider the pairs ((1, 1998), (2, 1997), ldots, (999, 1000)). Each pair contains numbers whose product is less than or equal to ( 1000000 ). We need to eliminate at least one number from each pair to satisfy the condition ( xy notin A ). 5. **Counting Eliminations:**    There are 999 such pairs, so we need to eliminate at least 999 numbers. If we eliminate the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 999 ), we ensure that no product of any two remaining numbers falls within the set. 6. **Forming the Subset:**    By eliminating the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 999 ), we are left with the numbers ( 1000, 1001, ldots, 1000000 ). This gives us a total of ( 1000000 - 999 = 999001 ) numbers. 7. **Verification:**    We need to verify that the remaining numbers ( 1000, 1001, ldots, 1000000 ) do not violate the condition. Since all remaining numbers are greater than or equal to 1000, any product of two such numbers will be at least ( 1000 times 1000 = 1000000 ), which is outside the range of our set. Therefore, the maximum possible size of ( A ) is ( 999001 ).

According to the problem, after spending on food and children's education, he spends 80% of the remaining income on house rent and is left with 8% of his income. Let's denote the percentage of his income spent on food as F. First, he spends 25% on children's education, so he is left with 100 - 25 = 75 units. Now, out of these 75 units, he spends F% on food. So he is left with 75 - F% of 75 units. Then, he spends 80% of the remaining amount on house rent. After this expenditure, he is left with 8 units (since 8% of his total income is left). So, the equation for the remaining income after spending on house rent is: (75 - F% of 75) - 80% of (75 - F% of 75) = 8 Let's solve for F: 75 - (F/100 * 75) - 0.8 * (75 - (F/100 * 75)) = 8 75 - 0.75F - 0.8 * (75 - 0.75F) = 8 75 - 0.75F - 60 + 0.6F = 8 Combine like terms: 15 - 0.75F + 0.6F = 8 15 - 0.15F = 8 Subtract 15 from both sides: -0.15F = 8 - 15 -0.15F = -7 Divide both sides by -0.15 to solve for F: F = -7 / -0.15 F = 46.67 Therefore, the man spends boxed{46.67%} of his income on food."},{"instruction":"Given a sequence {a_n} where a_1=2, a_{2n}=a_n+1, and a_{2n+1}=na_n, find the sum of the first 100 terms of {a_n}.","output":"From a_1=2, a_{2n}=a_n+1, and a_{2n+1}=n-a_n, we get a_{2n}+a_{2n+1}=n+1.

This specific sphere is called the edge-inscribed sphere (or exsphere). The existence of this sphere implies that for each edge of the tetrahedron, there is a unique point on the sphere that is the point of tangency. 2. **Introduction of Face-Touching Sphere for One Face**: Additionally, there exists a sphere that touches the three edges bounding at least one face of the tetrahedron (T), say face (ABC), and also touches the extensions of the edges opposite to (ABC). Let's denote this sphere as (S_{ABC}). 3. **Properties and Symmetry**: Consider face (ABC). The face-touching sphere (S_{ABC}) implies a kind of symmetry for the face (ABC) and its opposite edges (DA, DB,) and (DC). The existence of such a sphere means that the sum of the tangential distances from the vertices of (ABC) to the opposite edges must be equal, consistent with a particular distance property inherent in the geometric symmetry of the tetrahedron. 4. **Extension to Other Faces**: We need to prove that a similar sphere exists for the other faces of the tetrahedron. Let’s consider another face (BCD): - Assuming symmetry in the configuration of (T), and based on initial conditions about the tetrahedron holding true (having one face-touching sphere and an exsphere), we can infer that symmetry should hold for other faces through analogous reasoning. - **Tangency Configurations**: For face (BCD), the face-touching sphere (S_{BCD}) must similarly touch the edges (BC, CD,) and (DB) at points (P_{BC}, P_{CD}, P_{DB}), respectively, and also touch the extensions of edges (DA, DB,) and (DC). 5. **Verification for All Faces**: We apply this reasoning iteratively: - For face (ABD), there should be a sphere (S_{ABD}) that touches edges (AB, BD,) and (DA) along their tangency points and the extensions of edges (BC, CD,) and (CA). - For face (CAD), there should be a sphere (S_{CAD}) that touches edges (CA, AD,) and (DC) along their tangency points and the extensions of edges (AB, BC,) and (BD). 6. **Contradiction Check (Assuming Indirect Hypothesis)**: Suppose the contrary, that at least one face, say (DAB), does not have a corresponding face-touching sphere. This would break the coherent tangency conditions derived from the edge-inscribed sphere, leading to disproving the initial assumptions, thus reaffirming that each face indeed has its respective face-touching sphere. 7. **Conclusion**: From the reasoning above and the symmetry properties assumed from the initial conditions, we conclude that each face of the tetrahedron has a corresponding sphere that touches the three edges bounding that face and the extensions of the other three edges.

This particular arrangement corresponds to a single permutation function ( f ) where ( f ) maps every element cyclically. - **Case 2: Cycles of length 1:** Each element maps to itself, forming fixed points. 6. **Total Functions and Options:** Since every function either consists of one cycle of length 1993 or 1993 cycles of length 1, we are considering the two types of arrangements described above. - The single cycle of length 1993: There is exactly one function. - The fixed points: Each element is fixed under ( f ).

How many roses were there in total?","output":": 1. **Set up the system of equations based on the given statements** Let's denote the total number of roses by a. From the problem statement, we can derive the following equations: - When the roses are arranged in vases with 21 roses each, 13 roses are left: [ a = 21x + 13 ] where x is the number of full vases plus one additional vase. - When the roses are arranged in vases with 15 roses each, 8 roses are short: [ a = 15y - 8 ] where y is the number of full vases plus one additional vase. 2. **Set up the conditions** From these two equations, we can rewrite the first equation by adding 8 to both sides: [ a + 8 = 21x + 21 = 21(x + 1) ] and rewrite the second equation by adding 8 to both sides: [ a + 8 = 15y ] 3. **Combining the conditions** Since a + 8 needs to be a multiple of both 21 and 15, it must be a multiple of their least common multiple (LCM): [ text{LCM}(21, 15) = 105 ] Therefore, [ a + 8 = 105k quad text{for some integer } k ] Hence, [ a = 105k - 8 ] 4. **Find the valid range for (a)** Given that the number of roses, a, must be between 300 and 400, we now have the inequality: [ 300 leq a leq 400 ] Substituting the expression for a from step 3: [ 300 leq 105k - 8 leq 400 ] Adding 8 to all parts of the inequality: [ 308 leq 105k leq 408 ] Dividing the entire inequality by 105: [ frac{308}{105} leq k leq frac{408}{105} ] Simplifying these fractions: [ 2.933 leq k leq 3.885 ] Since (k) must be an integer, the only possible value for (k) within this range is: [ k = 3 ] 5. **Determine the total number of roses** Finally, substituting ( k = 3 ) back into the expression for (a): [ a = 105 cdot 3 - 8 = 315 - 8 = 307 ] # Conclusion The total number of roses delivered is: [ boxed{307} ]"},{"instruction":"On an 8 times 8 checkered board, 256 pieces are placed.

In one move, it is allowed to take 4 pieces lying on one cell and move them to 4 neighboring cells. For any initial arrangement of pieces, is it possible to ensure that each cell has an equal number of pieces?","output":"1. **Define the Problem Setup:** We have an 8 times 8 chessboard with 256 tokens distributed on it. Each cell can move tokens to its 4 neighboring cells in one move, and each cell has exactly 4 neighbors including wrap-around neighbors on the vertical and horizontal edges. 2. **Coloring the Chessboard in a Checkerboard Pattern:** We color the chessboard in a checkerboard pattern with black and white squares. There will be 32 black squares and 32 white squares. 3. **Analyzing Token Movements:** When we move 4 tokens from one cell to its 4 neighbors, each cell receives 1 token. Consequently, the number of tokens on black squares changes by +4, +0, or -4 tokens in one move. Therefore, the parity (even or odd) of the number of tokens on black squares remains unchanged after each move since adding or subtracting 4 does not alter the parity of an even number. 4. **Parity Check of Initial Configuration:** Let us assume that in the initial configuration (before making any moves), the number of tokens on the black squares is odd. Since the parity of the number of tokens on black squares remains constant, it can never become even after any number of moves. 5. **Requirement for Uniform Distribution:** For a uniform distribution, each cell needs to have an equal number of tokens. Thus, since there are 256 tokens in total, each cell should have exactly 4 tokens. 6. **Conclusion:** Given an initial setup where the number of tokens on black cells is odd, achieving a state where each cell has exactly 4 tokens is impossible because the parity condition cannot be satisfied. Therefore, it is not always possible to achieve a uniform distribution of tokens across all cells.

Specifically, it includes ( 2019 ) elements of the form ( qrp_i ) and one element of the form ( p_1p_2 dots p_{2019} ). Therefore, the first condition is satisfied. 3. **Verifying the Second Condition:** Consider any two distinct elements ( a ) and ( b ) in ( S ). We need to examine the set ( {gcd(a, b) : a, b in S, a neq b} ). - If ( a = qrp_i ) and ( b = qrp_j ) for ( i neq j ), then: [ gcd(a, b) = gcd(qrp_i, qrp_j) = qr ] which is not a prime. - If ( a = qrp_i ) and ( b = p_1p_2 dots p_{2019} ), then: [ gcd(a, b) = gcd(qrp_i, p_1p_2 dots p_{2019}) = p_i ] which is a prime. Therefore, the distinct primes in the set ( {gcd(a, b) : a, b in S, a neq b} ) are exactly ( p_1, p_2, dots, p_{2019} ). Thus, the second condition is satisfied. 4. **Verifying the Third Condition:** For any subset ( A ) of ( S ) containing at least two elements, we need to show that ( sumlimits_{a,b in A; a < b} ab ) is not a prime power. Note that for any ( a, b in S ) with ( a < b ), at least one of ( a ) or ( b ) must be of the form ( qrp_i ). Therefore, ( qr mid ab ) for every ( a, b in S ) with ( a < b ). Consequently, ( qr mid sumlimits_{a,b in A; a < b} ab ). Since ( qr ) is a product of two distinct primes, ( sumlimits_{a,b in A; a < b} ab ) cannot be a prime power.

Since there are only two sets, they must either be equal or one is a subset of the other. In either case, we can find two disjoint non-empty subsets of ( {1, 2} ) such that their unions are equal. This is trivial and serves as our base case. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for ( n-1 ). That is, for any ( n ) non-empty subsets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) of ( {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ), there exist two disjoint non-empty subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) such that the union of the subsets is equal. 3. **Induction Step:** We need to show that the statement holds for ( n ). Consider the sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n+1} ) which are non-empty subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ). 4. **Definitions:** For a set ( U ) of indices, define: [ S_U := bigcup_{x in U} A_x, quad V_U = {A_x mid x in U} ] Note that ( S_U ) is the union of the members of ( V_U ). 5. **Classification of Sets:** Call a set *bad* if it contains ( n ) and *good* otherwise. If there exists at most one *bad* set, then by the induction hypothesis, we are done. So assume there are at least two *bad* sets. 6. **Assumption:** Assume that there do not exist disjoint subsets ( X, Y ) of indices such that ( A_x, A_y ) are *good* for all ( x in X, y in Y ) and ( S_X = S_Y ). Otherwise, we are trivially done. 7. **Choosing Families:** Choose two families of sets ( A ) and ( B ) with ( n ) elements each such that each of them contains at least one bad set. Remove the element ( n ) from all the *bad* sets. By the induction hypothesis, we find two disjoint subsets ( X_1, Y_1 ) of indices in ( A ) and ( X_2, Y_2 ) in ( B ) satisfying: [ S_{X_1} = S_{Y_1}, quad V_{X_1} cap V_{Y_1} = emptyset ] [ S_{X_2} = S_{Y_2}, quad V_{X_2} cap V_{Y_2} = emptyset ] 8. **Ensuring Disjointness:** By our assumption, at least one of ( S_{X_1} ) or ( S_{Y_1} ) must contain a bad set, say ( S_{X_1} ). Similarly, assume that ( S_{Y_2} ) contains a bad set. 9. **Combining Sets:** Hence, we find ( M, N ) such that: [ S_M = S_{X_1} cup S_{X_2} cup {n} = S_{Y_1} cup S_{Y_2} cup {n} = S_N ] We can add back the ( {n} ) to all the bad sets which exist both in the LHS and RHS, and so we are done. 10. **Handling Overlap:** If there is a set ( A_k ) on both sides, then ( M, N ) are not disjoint. We can remove ( A_k ) from both sides and still have: [ S_M setminus A_k = S_N setminus A_k ] This is because all elements of ( A_k ) are in ( S_{Y_1} ) and ( S_{X_2} ). Hence, even if we delete the set ( A_k ) from both sides, the elements will still remain on both sides, and we will still have ( S_M setminus A_k = S_N setminus A_k ).

Since 10 is the least number that must be subtracted, it implies that 105819 is already divisible by the divisor we are looking for. To find the divisor, we can start by checking if 105819 is divisible by small prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. However, we can quickly see that 105819 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. It also does not end in 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. Let's check if it's divisible by 3 using the divisibility rule for 3, which states that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 105819 is: 1 + 0 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 9 = 24 Since 24 is divisible by 3, 105819 is also divisible by 3. Now, let's check if 105819 is divisible by any other number greater than 3 but less than 10. We can do this by performing division or checking the divisibility rules for other numbers. However, since the problem states that 10 is the least number that must be subtracted, it implies that the divisor we are looking for is the largest divisor of 105819 (other than 105819 itself).

We are given that after four treatments, the dog has 14 fleas left, so we can write the equation: [ F(1 - p)^4 = 14 ] We are also given that the dog had 210 more fleas before the treatments than after, so we can write the equation: [ F - 14 = 210 ] From this, we can find the initial number of fleas: [ F = 210 + 14 ] [ F = 224 ] Now we can substitute ( F ) back into the first equation to find ( p ): [ 224(1 - p)^4 = 14 ] To solve for ( p ), we first take the fourth root of both sides: [ (1 - p) = sqrt[4]{frac{14}{224}} ] [ (1 - p) = sqrt[4]{frac{1}{16}} ] [ (1 - p) = frac{1}{2} ] Now we can solve for ( p ): [ 1 - p = frac{1}{2} ] [ p = 1 - frac{1}{2} ] [ p = frac{1}{2} ] So the proportion of fleas removed by one treatment is ( frac{1}{2} ) or 50%. The ratio of fleas removed by one treatment to the total number of fleas before the treatment is ( p ) to ( F ), which is ( frac{1}{2} ) to ( 224 ), or simply ( 1 ) to ( 448 ) when we consider that removing half the fleas is equivalent to removing 112 out of 224. Therefore, the ratio is ( boxed{1:448} )."},{"instruction":"a singleelimination tournament, each game is played between two teams.

Let's rewrite ( a ) and ( frac{1}{2b} ) to form a perfect square: [ left(a + frac{1}{2b}right)^2 - left(frac{1}{2b}right)^2 + b^2 + frac{1}{b^2} ] This simplifies as follows: [ left(a + frac{1}{2b}right)^2 - frac{1}{4b^2} + b^2 + frac{1}{b^2} ] Combining the (frac{1}{4b^2}) and (frac{1}{b^2}) terms: [ left(a + frac{1}{2b}right)^2 + b^2 + frac{3}{4b^2} ] 2. **Analyze the Lower Bound:** The term (left(a + frac{1}{2b}right)^2) is a square term, and thus non-negative: [ left(a + frac{1}{2b}right)^2 geq 0 ] Therefore, we have: [ a^2 + b^2 + frac{a}{b} + frac{1}{b^2} geq b^2 + frac{3}{4b^2} ] 3. **Apply the AM-GM Inequality:** To find the minimum of ( b^2 + frac{3}{4b^2} ), we use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality): [ b^2 + frac{3}{4b^2} geq 2 sqrt{b^2 cdot frac{3}{4b^2}} = 2 sqrt{frac{3}{4}} = sqrt{3} ] Thus, the lower bound for ( b^2 + frac{3}{4b^2} ) is ( sqrt{3} ). 4. **Achieving the Minimum Value:** The equality in the AM-GM Inequality holds when: [ b^2 = frac{3}{4b^2} ] Solving for ( b ), we get: [ b^4 = frac{3}{4} quad Rightarrow quad b^2 = sqrt{frac{3}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} quad Rightarrow quad b = sqrt[4]{frac{3}{4}} = frac{sqrt[4]{3}}{sqrt{2}} ] Additionally, we require: [ a + frac{1}{2b} = 0 quad Rightarrow quad a = -frac{1}{2b} = -frac{1}{2 cdot frac{sqrt[4]{3}}{sqrt{2}}} = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2 sqrt[4]{3}} ] Substituting ( a = -frac{1}{sqrt[4]{3} sqrt{2}} ) and ( b = frac{sqrt[4]{3}}{sqrt{2}} ), into the expression confirms that it achieves the lower bound ( sqrt{3} ).

We denote this point as O. Let h represent the length of AD. We rescale the entire setup by a factor of 42, which simplifies the given lengths to AU = 2, AN = 3, and UB = 4. Consequently, AB = 6, making OA = OB = 3. Given that ON is a radius of the semicircle, we have ON = 3. This implies that triangle OAN is an equilateral triangle. We proceed to calculate the areas of three distinct regions: triangle OUN, sector ONB, and trapezoid UBCT. Let's denote these areas as X, Y, and Z, respectively. For triangle OUN, we find the area as follows: [X = frac{1}{2} cdot UO cdot NO cdot sin{60^circ} = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot 3 cdot sin{60^circ} = frac{3}{4}sqrt{3}] For sector ONB, the area is calculated by: [Y = frac{1}{3} pi (3)^2 = 3pi] To find the area of trapezoid UBCT, denoted as Z, we first determine the length of TC. By projecting T and N onto AB, we obtain points T' and N'. Observing that triangles UNN' and TUT' are similar, we establish the following relationship: [frac{TT'}{UT'} = frac{UN'}{NN'} implies frac{TT'}{h} = frac{1/2}{3sqrt{3}/2} implies TT' = frac{sqrt{3}}{9}h] Thus, the length of TC is: [TC = T'C - T'T = UB - TT' = 4 - frac{sqrt{3}}{9}h] The area of trapezoid UBCT is then: [Z = frac{1}{2}(BU + TC) cdot CB = frac{1}{2}left(8 - frac{sqrt{3}}{9}hright)h = 4h - frac{sqrt{3}}{18}h^2] Let L represent the area of the region on one side of line l, which includes regions X, Y, and Z. Therefore: [L = X + Y + Z = frac{3}{4}sqrt{3} + 3pi + 4h - frac{sqrt{3}}{18}h^2] Given that L is greater than the area on the other side of line l, we set up the ratio of these areas as 2:1. This leads to the equation: [frac{2}{1} = frac{L}{6h + frac{9}{2}pi - L} implies 12h + 9pi = 3L] Solving for h, we have: begin{align*} 12h + 9pi & = frac{9}{4}sqrt{3} + 9pi + 12h - frac{sqrt{3}}{6}h^2 0 & = frac{9}{4}sqrt{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{6}h^2 h^2 & = frac{9}{4} cdot 6 h & = frac{3}{2}sqrt{6} end{align*} Un-rescaling by a factor of 42, we find AD = frac{3}{2}sqrt{6} cdot 42 = 63sqrt{6}.

We start with finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 20. - The prime factorization of 15 is 3 times 5. - The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 times 5. - LCM of 15 and 20 is obtained by taking the highest power of all prime numbers present: 2^2 times 3 times 5 = 60. An integer is a multiple of both 15 and 20 if and only if it is a multiple of 60. - Dividing 300 by 60 gives quotient 5 (right before getting 300), so there are 5 multiples of 60 less than 300 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300).

For the 5 boxes, he uses 5(L + 2S) inches of tape. The 2 boxes that are 40 inches square need 3 pieces of tape each, all 40 inches long, so for each of these boxes, he uses 3 * 40 inches of tape. For the 2 square boxes, he uses 2 * 3 * 40 inches of tape. In total, Brian uses 5(L + 2S) + 2 * 3 * 40 inches of tape, and we know this equals 540 inches.

However, when we substitute these values into x^{2}+y^{2}, we obtain: [x^{2} + y^{2} = 5^{2} + 0^{2} = 25 + 0 = 25] Since 25 neq 0, this disproves the sufficiency of \\"xy=0\\" for \\"x^{2}+y^{2}=0\\". The condition \\"xy=0\\" does not guarantee that x^{2}+y^{2}=0. 2. **Testing for Necessity**: Given that x^{2}+y^{2}=0, we need to show that this implies xy=0.

Specifically, the n-th Fibonacci number F_n can be approximated using the formula: [ F_n = frac{alpha^n - beta^n}{sqrt{5}} ] where alpha = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} and beta = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2}. Since |beta| < 1, for large n, F_n is approximately: [ F_n approx frac{alpha^n}{sqrt{5}} ] 2. **Counting Fibonacci Numbers Less Than x**: To find the number of Fibonacci numbers less than x, we solve: [ frac{alpha^n}{sqrt{5}} leq x implies alpha^n leq x sqrt{5} implies n leq frac{ln(x sqrt{5})}{ln(alpha)} ] Therefore, the number of Fibonacci numbers less than x is approximately: [ n approx frac{ln(x sqrt{5})}{ln(alpha)} = frac{ln(x) + ln(sqrt{5})}{ln(alpha)} = frac{ln(x)}{ln(alpha)} + frac{ln(sqrt{5})}{ln(alpha)} ] For large x, this is approximately: [ n approx frac{ln(x)}{ln(alpha)} ] 3. **Counting r-Fibonacci Numbers**: An r-Fibonacci number is a sum of r (not necessarily distinct) Fibonacci numbers. The number of ways to choose r Fibonacci numbers (with repetition allowed) from the first n Fibonacci numbers is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{n+r-1}{r-1} ] For large n, this is approximately: [ binom{n+r-1}{r-1} approx frac{n^{r-1}}{(r-1)!} ] 4. **Comparing Growth Rates**: The number of r-Fibonacci numbers less than x is thus approximately: [ frac{n^{r-1}}{(r-1)!} approx frac{left(frac{ln(x)}{ln(alpha)}right)^{r-1}}{(r-1)!} = O((ln(x))^{r-1}) ] Since (ln(x))^{r-1} grows much slower than x itself, for large x, the number of r-Fibonacci numbers less than x is much smaller than x. 5. **Conclusion**: Since the number of r-Fibonacci numbers less than x grows slower than x, there must be infinitely many positive integers that are not r-Fibonacci numbers for any r, where 1 leq r leq 5.

This setup reflects a combinatorial problem where we must select 1010 positions out of 1012 positions without restriction. 6. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The number of ways to choose 1010 gaps out of 1012 is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{1012}{1010} ), which can be simplified using the symmetry property of binomial coefficients: [ binom{1012}{1010} = binom{1012}{2} ] 7. **Evaluating the Binomial Coefficient**: [ binom{1012}{2} = frac{1012 cdot 1011}{2} ] Calculate the value step-by-step: [ frac{1012 cdot 1011}{2} = frac{1023232}{2} = 511566 ] 8. **Conclusion**: The number of ways Denis can choose 1010 numbers from the list such that the sum of any two chosen numbers is neither 2021 nor 2022 is: [ boxed{511566} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a natural number ( n ), Roma wrote down three numbers ( n ), ( n+1 ), and ( n+2 ) on the board consecutively, without spaces.

This gives us the equation A+B+C=pi. - Rearranging this equation for B+C gives us B+C=pi-A. - Using the sine function, we apply it to both sides leading to sin(B+C) = sin(pi-A). - From the property of sine, we know that sin(theta) = sin(pi-theta) for any angle theta. Thus, sin(B+C) = sin A. - Therefore, Option A is correct because it follows from the properties of the sine function and the angle sum property of triangles. **For Option B:** - The statement implies that if cos A > 0, then angle A is acute. - Remembering that the cosine of an angle in the range (0, pi) is positive for acute angles and negative for obtuse angles, if cos A > 0, then indeed A is acute. - However, the conclusion that triangle ABC is an acute triangle from cos A > 0 alone is not guaranteed because we do not have information about angles B and C. Any of them could still be obtuse. - Thus, Option B is incorrect because it makes an unwarranted generalization based on the cosine of a single angle. **For Option C:** - Similar to Option A, we know that B+C=pi-A. - Applying the cosine function, we get cos(B+C) = cos(pi-A). - However, the property of cosine for this situation is cos(pi-theta) = -cos(theta). Therefore, cos(B+C) = -cos A. - This shows that Option C is incorrect because it contradicts the established property of the cosine function. **For Option D:** - The statement says if sin A = sin B, then A = B. - Given that the sine function can have the same value for two different angles in the range (0, pi), these angles must either be equal or supplementary (sum up to pi). - However, in the context of a triangle, two angles being supplementary means the third angle would have no measure, which is impossible. - Therefore, the only possibility that remains within the context of a triangle is A = B. - Thus, Option D is correct based on the properties of the sine function and the geometric constraints of a triangle.

What is the value of p (in the interval 0 le p le 1) that minimizes G(p)?","output":"To solve for the value of p that minimizes G(p), we follow these steps: 1. **Understanding F(p, q)**: Given F(p, q) = -2pq + 3p(1-q) + 3(1-p)q - 4(1-p)(1-q), we observe that for a fixed p, F(p, q) is a linear function of q. This implies that its maximum value, for a given p, occurs either at the endpoints of the interval for q, which are q = 0 or q = 1. 2. **Calculating F(p, 0) and F(p, 1)**: - For q = 0, we have F(p, 0) = -2p(0) + 3p(1-0) + 3(1-p)(0) - 4(1-p)(1-0) = 3p - 4. - For q = 1, we have F(p, 1) = -2p(1) + 3p(1-1) + 3(1-p)(1) - 4(1-p)(1-1) = 3 - 5p. 3. **Defining G(p)**: Given the above, G(p) = max(7p - 4, 3 - 5p). 4. **Finding where 7p - 4 = 3 - 5p**: To find the value of p where these two expressions are equal, we solve the equation 7p - 4 = 3 - 5p. This gives us 12p = 7, or p = frac{7}{12}. 5. **Analyzing G(p)**: - For p < frac{7}{12}, G(p) = 3 - 5p, which means G(p) is decreasing in this interval. - For p > frac{7}{12}, G(p) = 7p - 4, indicating G(p) is increasing in this interval. 6. **Conclusion**: Since G(p) is decreasing for p < frac{7}{12} and increasing for p > frac{7}{12}, it reaches its minimum at p = frac{7}{12}. Therefore, the value of p that minimizes G(p) is boxed{frac{7}{12}}."},{"instruction":"A binding factory binds about 362 books per hour on average.

This is because the smallest prime divisor of (kn) will repeat in a periodic manner due to the periodic nature of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. 5. **Non-Periodicity of the Original Sequence:** - To show that ((a_n)) is not periodic, we need to demonstrate that there is no period (T) such that (a_n = a_{n+T}) for all (n). - Assume for contradiction that (4T) is a period of the sequence ((a_n)). 6. **Prime Number Selection:** - Let (q = 4m - 1) be a prime number that does not divide (T).

We extend this solution to the case of 10 suitcases and 10 keys. 1. **Step 1: Initial Scenario with 6 Suitcases and 6 Keys** - We need to find each key's corresponding suitcase optimally. - Start with the first key and try it on each of the 6 suitcases one by one. Eventually, it will open its corresponding suitcase. - In the worst-case scenario, if none of the first 5 suitcases open, the key must correspond to the 6th suitcase. This requires testing each key once, taking up 5 attempts for the first key (testing it on the 5 other suitcases). 2. **Step 2: Continue with Remaining Keys and Suitcases** - Once the first key has matched with its suitcase, we are left with 5 keys and 5 suitcases. - Apply the same method: try the next key on the remaining 5 suitcases, taking a maximum of 4 attempts if the first 4 trials fail (it will match the remaining 5th suitcase). - Repeat this process for the remaining keys: - 3rd key: 3 attempts - 4th key: 2 attempts - 5th key: 1 attempt, leaving the last key to match the only remaining suitcase. 3. **Step-by-step Calculation** - Total number of attempts needed: 5 (for the 1st key) + 4 (for the 2nd key) + 3 (for the 3rd key) + 2 (for the 4th key) + 1 (for the 5th key) Thus, 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 Therefore, the minimum number of attempts needed to ensure all 6 suitcases are open is: boxed{15} 4. **Step 3: Extending to 10 Suitcases and 10 Keys** - Apply the same method: Start with the first key, and in the worst-case scenario, trying it on all 9 options before it matches the 10th suitcase. - For the remaining keys: - 9 attempts for the 1st key - 8 attempts for the 2nd key - 7 attempts for the 3rd key - ... - 2 attempts for the 9th key - 1 attempt for the 10th key because it will match the only remaining suitcase. 5. **Step-by-step Calculation** - Total number of attempts needed: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 This is the sum of the first 9 positive integers: sum_{i=1}^{9} i = frac{9 times (9 + 1)}{2} = 45 Therefore, the minimum number of attempts needed to ensure all 10 suitcases are open is: boxed{45}"},{"instruction":"Last winter, 150 students attended an art camp.

The only combination of three distinct numbers from 1 to 9 that sum to 7 is: [ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 ] 3. Next, consider the diagonal with the sum equal to 21. To determine the combination, we note that the only possible way to get a sum of 21 with three distinct numbers from 1 to 9 is: [ 9 + 8 + 4 = 21 ] In both cases, the number 4 must be at the intersection of the diagonals, implying it is in the center cell of the grid. 4.

Since vectors overrightarrow{m} and overrightarrow{n} are collinear, their cross product is zero. This gives us (a - b) sin(A + C) = (a - c)(sin A + sin C).

A divisor ( d ) of ( n ) is called \\"good\\" if ( d + 1 ) is also a divisor of ( n ). We need to find all natural numbers ( n ) such that at least half of the divisors of ( n ) are good. 2. **Key Insights:** - If ( d ) is a good divisor, then ( d + 1 ) is also a divisor of ( n ). Therefore, for ( n ) to have a good divisor ( d ), ( n ) must be divisible by ( d(d+1) ). - Since ( d ) and ( d + 1 ) are coprime (i.e., gcd( (d, d+1) = 1 )), ( n ) must be divisible by the product ( d(d + 1) ). This means: [ n geq d(d + 1) > d^2 ] Hence, ( d < sqrt{n} ). 3. **Finding Good Divisors:** - For any divisor ( d ), there is a corresponding divisor ( frac{n}{d} ) such that ( d times frac{n}{d} = n ). - If ( d < sqrt{n} ), then ( frac{n}{d} > sqrt{n} ). This implies that at most one of ( d ) or ( frac{n}{d} ) can be less than ( sqrt{n} ). 4. **Condition on Good Divisors:** - Since ( n ) needs to have at least half of its divisors being good, all divisors less than ( sqrt{n} ) must be good. This ensures that at least half of the divisors greater than or equal to ( sqrt{n} ) can correspond to the good divisors that are less than ( sqrt{n} ). 5. **Initial Verification:** - The number 1 is always a divisor and ( 1 < sqrt{n} ). Thus, for 1 to be good, ( 2 ) must be a divisor of ( n ). 6. **Further Analysis:** By continuing the logic, all numbers from 1 up to ( k = leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor ) must be divisors of ( n ). This implies ( n ) has a certain structure: - If ( n ) has three divisors, then ( n ) must be divisible by ( k, k-1, ) and ( k-2 ). This gives: [ frac{1}{2}k(k-1)(k-2) leq n < (k+1)^2 ] 7. **Solving the Cubic Inequality:** - Simplifying the inequality gives: [ 4k^2 + 1 > k^3 ] Which yields ( k leq 4 ). 8. **Checking Possible ( k ) Values:** - ( k = 2 ), ( k = 3 ), and ( k = 4 ) need to be verified: - For ( k = 2 ): [ n = text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6 ] - For ( k = 3 ): [ n = text{lcm}(2, 3, 4) = 12 ] - Both values are checked to ensure they fulfill the condition, resulting in another number: - ( n = 2 ) is also a solution because 2 itself satisfies the initial condition. 9. **Conclusion:** The natural numbers ( n ) such that at least half of its divisors are good are: [ boxed{2, 6, 12} ]"},{"instruction":"Evička had a construction set with nine pieces, labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

A = 4000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*2) A = 4000(1 + 0.10)^2 A = 4000(1.10)^2 A = 4000 * 1.21 A = 4840 The compound interest earned is A - P: Compound Interest = 4840 - 4000 Compound Interest = 840 Now, we know that the simple interest on the certain sum of money is half of this compound interest, so the simple interest is: Simple Interest = 840 / 2 Simple Interest = 420 The formula for simple interest is: Simple Interest = P * r * t Where: Simple Interest = the simple interest earned over a certain period P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money) r = the annual interest rate (decimal) t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for (in years) We are given that P = 1750, r = 8% or 0.08, and we need to find t. 420 = 1750 * 0.08 * t Now, let's solve for t: t = 420 / (1750 * 0.08) t = 420 / 140 t = 3 So, the money was placed on simple interest for boxed{3} years."},{"instruction":"To celebrate the Chinese football team's first entry into the World Cup, Pinghu Sports Equipment Factory donated a batch of footballs to the Wuxia Middle School football team.

The product of the zeros squared is (alpha beta)^2, and we're told this value equals the sum of the coefficients, which is 3 + d + 9. The sum of zeros alpha + (-alpha) + beta + (-beta) = 0. By Vieta's formulas, the coefficient d in 3x^4 + dx^2 + 9 is associated with the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, which simplifies to -d because each product contributes -alpha^2, -beta^2, alpha^2, and beta^2.

The smallest number is 1441. One of the numbers it is divisible by is 12. What are the other numbers it is divisible by?","output":"To find the other numbers that 1441 + 1 (which is 1442) is divisible by, we need to factorize 1442. Let's start by dividing 1442 by the number we already know it's divisible by, which is 12. 1442 ÷ 12 = 120.1666... Since 1442 is not exactly divisible by 12, there seems to be a mistake. Let's correct this and find the factors of 1442. We can start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers and move upwards: - 1442 is not divisible by 2 since it's not an even number. - 1442 is not divisible by 3 since the sum of its digits (1+4+4+2) is 11, which is not a multiple of 3. - 1442 is not divisible by 5 since it doesn't end in 0 or 5. Let's try dividing by the next prime numbers: - 1442 ÷ 7 = 206, which is not an integer. - 1442 ÷ 11 = 131, which is an integer. So, 11 is a factor of 1442. Now let's divide 131 by prime numbers to see if it has any factors: - 131 is a prime number itself, so it's only divisible by 1 and 131. Therefore, the prime factorization of 1442 is 11 * 131. These are the prime factors, but 1442 could also be divisible by any combination of these prime factors. So, the numbers that 1442 is divisible by are: - 1 (trivially, since every number is divisible by 1) - 11 (a prime factor) - 131 (a prime factor) - 1442 (the number itself) Since boxed{1442} is the product of two prime numbers, there are no other factors."},{"instruction":"Find the curve defined by the equation [r = frac{1}{1 sin theta}.] (A) Line (B) Circle (C) Parabola (D) Ellipse (E) Hyperbola Enter the letter of the correct option.","output":"Starting from the given equation: [r = frac{1}{1 - sin theta}.] Similar to the original problem, rearrange the equation: [r - r sin theta = 1.] Express r and sin theta in terms of Cartesian coordinates where x = r cos theta and y = r sin theta: [r - y = 1 implies r = 1 + y.] Now, square both sides to express in terms of x and y: [r^2 = (1 + y)^2 = 1 + 2y + y^2.] Since r^2 = x^2 + y^2: [x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2y + y^2 implies x^2 = 1 + 2y.] This equation, x^2 = 1 + 2y, represents the graph of a parabola.

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points: 2x - 2 = 0 implies 2x = 2 implies x = 1. To determine whether this critical point corresponds to a minimum, maximum, or neither, we examine the sign of the derivative before and after x = 1: - For x < 1, f'(x) = 2x - 2 < 0, indicating the function is decreasing. - For x > 1, f'(x) = 2x - 2 > 0, indicating the function is increasing. Since the function transitions from decreasing to increasing at x = 1, this point is a minimum. To find the minimum value of f(x), we substitute x = 1 into the original function: f(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) = 1 - 2 = -1.

The consumption increases by 15%, so the new consumption is C * 1.15. The new revenue, R', from the tax after these changes is R' = T * (1 - X/100) * C * 1.15. We are given that the effect on revenue is a decrease of 6.85%, so the new revenue is 93.15% of the original revenue: R' = R * 0.9315 Substituting the expressions for R and R' we get: T * (1 - X/100) * C * 1.15 = T * C * 0.9315 Now we can cancel out T and C from both sides since they are non-zero: (1 - X/100) * 1.15 = 0.9315 Now we solve for X: 1.15 - 1.15 * (X/100) = 0.9315 1.15 - 0.9315 = 1.15 * (X/100) 0.2185 = 1.15 * (X/100) Now we divide both sides by 1.15: 0.2185 / 1.15 = X/100 X = (0.2185 / 1.15) * 100 X ≈ 19 So the tax was diminished by approximately boxed{19%} ."},{"instruction":"The mean of three numbers is 8 more than the least of the numbers and 20 less than the greatest.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of nuts in the combined mixture: - Sue's nuts: 30 grams - Jane's nuts: 60 grams Total nuts = 30 grams + 60 grams = 90 grams We are told that the combined mixture contains 45% nuts. Since the total mixture is 200 grams, 45% of 200 grams is: 0.45 * 200 grams = 90 grams This confirms our calculation of the total amount of nuts in the mixture. Now, we need to find out what percent of the combined mixture is dried fruit. We know that Sue contributed 70 grams of dried fruit, and since Jane's mix doesn't contain dried fruit, the total amount of dried fruit in the combined mixture is also 70 grams. To find the percentage of dried fruit in the combined mixture, we divide the amount of dried fruit by the total weight of the mixture and then multiply by 100: Percentage of dried fruit = (Amount of dried fruit / Total weight of mixture) * 100 Percentage of dried fruit = (70 grams / 200 grams) * 100 Percentage of dried fruit = 0.35 * 100 Percentage of dried fruit = 35% Therefore, the combined mixture is boxed{35%} dried fruit."},{"instruction":"The profits of QRS company rose by a certain percentage from March to April, then dropped 20% from April to May, then rose 50% from May to June.

The argument of the sine function is 2x, which affects the period of the sine function. The basic sine function, sin(x), has a period of 2pi. When the argument is 2x, the period is divided by the coefficient of x, which in this case is 2. Therefore, the period of sin(2x) is frac{2pi}{2} = pi. However, f(x) = sin^2(2x) involves squaring the sine function. This squaring does not change the period but rather affects the function's amplitude. To see the effect on the period more clearly, we can use a trigonometric identity to rewrite f(x) in a different form. The identity sin^2(x) = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}cos(2x) allows us to rewrite f(x) as follows: [ f(x) = sin^2(2x) = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}cos(4x) ] This form reveals that the argument of the cosine function is 4x, which suggests a period of frac{2pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2} for the cosine function.

To find out how much she spent on the swimming goggles, we subtract the amount left from the amount she had after buying the video game: 75 - 60 = 15 Now, we have the amount spent on swimming goggles (15) and the amount left after buying the video game (75). To find the ratio of the amount spent on swimming goggles to the amount left after buying the video game, we write it as: Amount spent on swimming goggles : Amount left after buying the video game 15 : 75 To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 15: (15 / 15) : (75 / 15) 1 : 5 So, the ratio of the amount spent on swimming goggles to the amount left after buying the video game is boxed{1:5} ."},{"instruction":"the diagram, EF and GH are straight lines.

To understand the area of the trapezoid ABCD, we observe that triangles AKM and BKP are congruent by construction. This is due to these triangles being symmetric with respect to the midpoint K and the parallel nature of the line MP to CD. 4. The congruence of triangles AKM and BKP implies that the trapezoid ABCD is equal in area to the parallelogram MPCD. This is because the trapezoid can be split into triangles AKM, BKP and parallelogram MPDC, and the sum of the areas of the two triangles AKM and BKP will be the same because they are congruent. 5. The area of a parallelogram is given by the product of the base and height.

Since ( A A_1 ) is tangent to the circle at ( A_1 ) and ( A_1 O ) is a radius, ( A A_1 perp A_1 O ). Thus, ( A_1 O ) is perpendicular to ( A A_1 ), and by definition of the radius and tangent, the length of ( A_1 O ) is equal to ( a ). Similarly, ( B_1 O = b ) and ( C_1 O = c ). 3. Notice that ( OA_1 ), ( OB_1 ), and ( OC_1 ) are radii of the circle and that all these points lie on a circle of the same radius at distance ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) respectively from ( O ). 4. To find the center ( O ), we need a point that is equidistant from ( A_1 ), ( B_1 ), and ( C_1 ). This point ( O ) must be such that it lies on the radical axis of the circles centered at ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) with radii ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to the two circles. 5. Construct the radical axis of any two circles centered at ( A ) and ( B ) with radii ( a ) and ( b ). This can be done by considering the equation: [ PA^2 - a^2 = PB^2 - b^2 ] where ( P ) is a point on the radical axis. Simplifying, [ PA^2 - PB^2 = a^2 - b^2. ] This defines a line. Similarly, construct the radical axis of the circles centered at ( B ) and ( C ) with radii ( b ) and ( c ). 6. The point ( O ) is the intersection of these two radical axes, which are linear equations as described above. Hence, the intersection point of these two lines gives the center ( O ). 7. Once ( O ) is located, the radius of the circle can be constructed. The radius is simply the distance from ( O ) to any of the tangent points ( A_1 ), ( B_1 ), or ( C_1 ). Since ( O ) is equidistant from all three points by construction, we can measure: [ text{Radius} = OA_1 = a = OB_1 = b = OC_1 = c. ] 8.

Each flower bed is connected such that no two adjoining paths have the same color. We need to show that there exists a way to color the paths so that each color is used exactly (n) times. 2. **Define Counts and Optimization Function**: For each coloring strategy (s) of the paths ensuring that no two adjacent paths share the same color, let (s_1, s_2, ldots, s_m) represent the number of paths colored with the 1st, 2nd, (ldots), (m)-th color respectively. Define the function: [ f(s) = left| s_1 - n right| + left| s_2 - n right| + cdots + left| s_m - n right| ] This function (f(s)) measures the total deviation of each color's path count from (n). 3. **Existence of a Minimizing Strategy**: Since there are a finite number of such colorings, there exists at least one coloring strategy (s) that minimizes (f(s)). 4. **Proof by Contradiction**: Suppose for contradiction that (f(s) neq 0), which means: [ exists i, j text{ such that } s_i > n text{ and } s_j < n ] 5. **Graph Theory Consideration**: View each flower bed as a vertex and each path as an edge, forming a graph (G) with (mn) edges and (m) colors. Consider the subgraph formed by the edges of colors (i) and (j). 6. **Subgraph Properties**: By the problem setup, each vertex (flower bed) can be connected by at most 1 edge of color (i) and at most 1 edge of color (j). Thus, each vertex has degree at most 2 in this subgraph. Such a subgraph must therefore be a disjoint union of cycles and chains, with edges of colors (i) and (j) alternating along each cycle or chain. 7. **Edge Counts in Cycles and Chains**: Within each cycle, the number of edges colored (i) must equal the number of edges colored (j). Within each chain, the differences between the counts of (i) and (j) edges must be at most 1. Given (s_i > n > s_j), there must exist a chain where the number of edges colored (i) exceeds the number of edges colored (j) by exactly 1. 8. **Color Exchange to Reduce (f(s))**: Reverse the colors on any chain of length greater than 1, where the number of (i) colored edges exceeds the number of (j) colored edges by 1. This operation decreases (f(s)) by 2 since the new count of (i) colored edges decreases by 1, and the new count of (j) colored edges increases by 1, reducing the overall deviation: [ f(s) - 2 ] This contradicts the assumption that (f(s)) was the minimum value. 9. **Conclusion**: The contradiction implies that our initial assumption (f(s) neq 0) is false. Therefore, (f(s) = 0) must hold for the minimally deviating coloring strategy. Consequently, each color is used exactly (n) times.

Thus, m = boxed{24}."},{"instruction":"The *rank* of a rational number q is the unique k for which q=frac{1}{a_1}+cdots+frac{1}{a_k} , where each a_i is the smallest positive integer q such that qgeq frac{1}{a_1}+cdots+frac{1}{a_i} . Let q be the largest rational number less than frac{1}{4} with rank 3 , and suppose the expression for q is frac{1}{a_1}+frac{1}{a_2}+frac{1}{a_3} . Find the ordered triple (a_1,a_2,a_3) .","output":"1. We are given that the rational number ( q ) has a rank of 3 and is expressed as ( q = frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + frac{1}{a_3} ), where each ( a_i ) is the smallest positive integer such that ( q geq frac{1}{a_1} + cdots + frac{1}{a_i} ). 2. We need to find the largest rational number ( q ) less than ( frac{1}{4} ) with rank 3. 3. We start by finding the smallest possible ( a_1 ). Since ( q < frac{1}{4} ), we need ( frac{1}{a_1} < frac{1}{4} ). The smallest integer ( a_1 ) that satisfies this is ( a_1 = 5 ) because ( frac{1}{5} = 0.2 ) and ( 0.2 < 0.25 ). 4. Next, we need to find ( a_2 ) such that ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{a_2} < frac{1}{4} ). We have: [ frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{a_2} < frac{1}{4} ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{1}{a_2} < frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{5} = frac{5 - 4}{20} = frac{1}{20} ] Therefore, the smallest integer ( a_2 ) that satisfies this is ( a_2 = 21 ) because ( frac{1}{21} < frac{1}{20} ). 5. Finally, we need to find ( a_3 ) such that ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{21} + frac{1}{a_3} < frac{1}{4} ). We have: [ frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{21} + frac{1}{a_3} < frac{1}{4} ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{1}{a_3} < frac{1}{4} - left( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{21} right) ] [ frac{1}{a_3} < frac{1}{4} - frac{21 + 5}{105} = frac{1}{4} - frac{26}{105} ] Converting ( frac{1}{4} ) to a common denominator: [ frac{1}{4} = frac{105}{420} ] [ frac{1}{4} - frac{26}{105} = frac{105}{420} - frac{104}{420} = frac{1}{420} ] Therefore, the smallest integer ( a_3 ) that satisfies this is ( a_3 = 421 ) because ( frac{1}{421} < frac{1}{420} ). 6. Thus, the ordered triple ( (a_1, a_2, a_3) ) is ( (5, 21, 421) ). The final answer is (boxed{(5, 21, 421)})."},{"instruction":"An equilateral triangle is inscribed in the ellipse whose equation is 9x^2+25y^2=225. One vertex of the triangle is positioned at (frac{5}{3},0), and one altitude of the triangle is contained in the xaxis. Find the square of the length of each side of the triangle.","output":"Let the vertices of the equilateral triangle be A, B, and C. We are given the position of vertex A at (frac{5}{3},0), and we know one of the altitudes lies along the x-axis, thus A is a vertex lying on this axis. We start by scaling the ellipse equation 9x^2 + 25y^2 = 225 to the standard form frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1. The major axis has a length of 2 times frac{15}{3} = 10 and the minor axis has a length of 2 times 3 = 6. As the triangle is equilateral, all its angles are 60^circ. The other two vertices B and C should also lie on the ellipse and form 60^circ angles using the x-axis as one of the triangle sides' reference Given symmetry about x-axis, let's denote vertices B and C as (x_3,y_3) and (x_3,-y_3) respectively. Due to the equilateral nature, the distances AB and AC are equal. We now have to find the coordinates (x_3,y_3) such that y_3 = x_3 sqrt{3} (from the 60^circ angle property tan(60^circ) = sqrt{3}). Substitute into the ellipse's equation: 9x_3^2 + 25(x_3 sqrt{3})^2 = 225 9x_3^2 + 75x_3^2 = 225 84x_3^2 = 225 x_3^2 = frac{225}{84} = frac{75}{28} x_3 = pm sqrt{frac{75}{28}} = pm frac{5sqrt{21}}{14} Choosing the positive solution for simplicity (since symmetric): x_3 = frac{5sqrt{21}}{14}, y_3 = frac{5sqrt{63}}{14} Calculate the side length squared as AB: AB^2 = (frac{5sqrt{21}}{14} - frac{5}{3})^2 + (frac{5sqrt{63}}{14})^2 = left(frac{-5}{42}right)^2 + left(frac{15sqrt{7}}{14}right)^2 = frac{25}{1764} + frac{1575}{196} = frac{25}{1764} + frac{135}{14} = frac{25}{1764} + frac{1890}{196} = frac{1475}{196} Box the final answer: boxed{frac{1475}{196}}"},{"instruction":"35% of 360 equals what number?","output":"35% of 360 equals 126.
