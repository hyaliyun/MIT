Your immediately respond will be highly appreciated Regards Miss. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #2, from Cameron McCaffrey (me): Dear Miss. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Good Evening, I am utterly shocked and deeply saddened by the news of Mr. Kwame Mensah’s demise. It is indeed a tragedy to hear of such unexpected events and the loss of a life. I must admit, I am a bit puzzled as I have had only a brief correspondence with Mr. Mensah regarding some philanthropic work he was passionate about, and I can’t fathom why he’d mention me in his letter. Nonetheless, your discovery and this message certainly demand my attention. Regarding the funds you’ve discovered, I hadn’t been made aware of any financial matters concerning me directly, and his decision to involve me in such is as surprising as it is concerning. I would like to assist in any way I can to ensure that Mr. Mensah’s wishes, as expressed in his final letter, are honored respectfully and lawfully. Would you please forward the letter he penned to my attention? This would help me understand the situation better and determine the next steps. Also, I would greatly appreciate if you could send me a few more details about the circumstances of Mr. Mensah’s passing, as any information could be crucial in ensuring everything is handled appropriately. Lastly, regarding the picture of the funds, I strongly suggest that we handle such sensitive matters through more secure channels. It’s unfortunate that there are unscrupulous individuals who prey on situations like this, so please maintain the highest discretion and let me know the preferred secure method to proceed with our communication. Thank you for reaching out, and please accept my condolences for all those affected by this tragedy.

We have been in an arrangement to see how late Kwame Mensah can be put to rest. Well I hope that you will perform your duty as required from your Friend late Kwame who stated clearly in the letter to you that you should help him to invest his fund. All that is needed is to get the affidavit of claim which costs US200.00 to present to the authority so the fund can be released immediately. They have demanded the Affidavit as part of the constitutional Law. I have attached the copy of the letter and I hope that you will do your utmost to see how we can work together to claim the fund as the authority awaits us. I would appreciate it if we can have a better conversation on Whatsapp. Thank you Regards <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #4, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Good Day, Thank you for your patience and for sending over the requested information. My sincere condolences once more on the passing of Mr. Kwame Mensah. It is in both our interests to ensure his last wishes are fulfilled with respect and in accordance with the law. I have carefully read the letter sent by the late Mr. Mensah, and it has left me with a heavy heart but also a clear sense of duty. If my assistance is required to handle the investments as he desired, then I am prepared to help see his final wishes come to fruition. Regarding the legal requirement for an affidavit of claim, I understand the importance of adhering to the proper legal channels. I am ready to proceed with the necessary steps. However, before we proceed further, I would like to ensure all actions taken to comply with international financial transaction regulations and anti-money laundering measures. It is critical that this matter is handled with utmost integrity. For the payment of the affidavit, could you provide me with the details of whom the payment should be addressed to and the secure means by which the transaction could take place? Should it be via bank transfer or another secure method? I would appreciate an official invoice or request form to ensure the accuracy and traceability of our arrangements. Regarding communication, I understand the utility of WhatsApp for quick messages, but I must stress that for the transfer of sensitive information, we should use encrypted email or a secure document-sharing service. Protecting both our privacy and the integrity of this process is non-negotiable. Please provide me with the specifics of the affidavit fee transaction and any other necessary documentation or steps that must be followed. Upon receipt of such information, I will coordinate my efforts to fulfill the requirements expediently. Your guidance through this process is invaluable, and I look forward to your prompt response. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #5, from Maria: Dear Mr. Cameron McCaffrey Good Morning and how are you doing today? it's so lovely to read from you and your words are so touching and make me so emotional. You are such a good man with an amazing heart of care and understanding, I just can't find the words to describe you. Thank you so much that you have the desire to show respect to the dead and to fulfill his last wish before he left the surface of this earth. I have so much respect for you. in regard to the document covering this fund I can tell you and confirm that every documentation is available and will be presented to you once we are able to obtain the Affidavit of claim in your name and after which you have to advise on how the funds should be sent to you through legal means. Concerning the required for of US200.00 I do not know what means you would like to send the funds through, but I have provided a bank account below and also name to send through Money gram or western union. Here the account details : Account Name: CNC TRAVEL AND TOUR LIMITED Account Number: 9040008755064 Swift Code: SBICGHAC Branch:Junction Mall Address: P.O Box 40 Tema Ghana BANK DETAILS: STANBIC BANK GHANA Address :Stanbtic Heights 215 South Libration link Airport city Accra,Greater Accra Name through Money gram/ Western Union Darlington Ekow Sawyer. Looking forward to hearing from you Thank you for your complete understanding and cooperation. Regards Maria Email #6, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Good Morning, I appreciate your kind words and the trust you have placed in me to honor the final wishes of the late Mr. Kwame Mensah. Your empathetic approach to this predicament has given me great comfort throughout the process and reinforces my determination to see this matter through with the dignity it necessitates. I am ready to proceed with the remittance of the US200.00 for the affidavit of claim. To maintain the integrity of our transaction and to ensure that every action is traceable and compliant with the legal frameworks that govern international monetary exchanges, I have a few preliminary measures that I insist we follow: 1. Legal Documentation: Before making the payment, I kindly request a scanned copy of the official request for the affidavit of claim, as well as any accompanying legal documentation that can verify the authenticity of this requirement. This is not out of mistrust, but rather a practice of due diligence which I am certain you can understand and appreciate. 2. Official Receipt: Upon transferring the funds, either to the provided bank account or through MoneyGram/Western Union, I will require an official receipt that outlines the purpose of the payment. This receipt should come from a verifiable source or authority to ensure all actions are transparent and above reproach. 3. Secured Transactions: While you have generously provided a bank account and an individual’s name for the transfer via MoneyGram/Western Union, for added security, could we also consider using a secure online platform that provides payment protection services? This would give both parties peace of mind and a level of assurance regarding the transaction. Once we have established these checks are in place, I will visit my local bank to initiate the transaction or consider a secure digital payment platform as suggested. For privacy and security reasons, I must decline the invitation to discuss this matter over WhatsApp. As I stated in my previous correspondence, it is critical that all communications regarding this sensitive situation be handled through encrypted email or a secure document sharing service. I trust that all of these practices resonate with your commitment to handling this process with the utmost respect and legality. I am here to cooperate fully, and I look forward to receiving the necessary documentation so we may proceed accordingly. Thank you, Miss Dosu, for your understanding and continued assistance. May we bring closure to this matter with all the respect it deserves. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #7, from Maria: Dear Mr. Cameron Good Morning and Happy christmas in advance Please find attached copy of the invoice and letter from the Ghana police force. I will expect you to do the needful for proceedings. Thank you for your cooperation Regards Maria Email #8, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Good Morning, and I extend to you early Season’s Greetings as well. Thank you for promptly sending the invoice and the letter from the Ghana Police Force. They are instrumental documents that help validate the process we are engaging in. I have carefully reviewed both documents and appreciate your attention to ensuring this matter proceeds with transparency and attention to detail. Before I transfer the funds required for the affidavit of claim, I wish to reiterate the importance of securing this transaction. I acknowledge receipt of your bank details and the name provided for the MoneyGram/Western Union transfer option; however, I am engaged in discussions with my financial advisor to ensure all transactions are protected against fraud and comply fully with international regulations. To facilitate the payment while maintaining robust security and traceability, I am considering the following possible avenues: 1. Escrow Services: Utilizing a trusted third-party escrow service to hold the payment until the affidavit is officially claimed and recorded. This extra measure protects both parties and provides an added layer of security and trust. 2. Bank Transfer with Confirmation: If we proceed with a direct bank transfer, my financial advisor insists on obtaining a transaction confirmation code and a point of contact at the bank in Ghana to verify the transfer was received and allocated correctly. After all security measures are in place, I am ready to move forward with the remittance. To comply with my personal and advisor’s due diligence policies, I would kindly request the following from your end: - Confirmation of the use of a recognized third-party escrow service or additional bank transfer details as outlined above. - The anticipated timeframe for the completion of this process after the funds have been secured. - Any additional steps that might be required from my side after the transfer to ensure that Mr. Kwame Mensah’s wishes are met promptly. The integrity of these proceedings is my utmost priority, and I am sure you share this focus. Once all the security protocols are established, I will arrange for the transfer at the earliest possible time. Once again, thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your guidance is essential, and I commend your commitment to handling Mr. Mensah’s final wishes with the care and solemnity they deserve. Looking forward to your prompt response and the additional information as requested. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #9, from Maria: Dear Mr. Cameron Thank you for your quick response. Kindly note that I have no further document concerning this issue as all are with the authority and it will be given to you after obtaining the affidavit of claim and present to the Ghana Police. I have only contacted you and hope you help the late man who put a wish on you. Again, the police have confirmed that immediately we present the affidavit of claim in your name. The fund will be handed over to me and from there you can then give instructions on how this fund can be sent to you. The police has also advise that i contact a bank to help me do the transfer if ok by you Please understand that I am only helping you and I cannot demand too much from the Police because they have already asked me to do what is required for the release of this fund. It seems you have trust issues and also I do not understand why you have refused to communicate through telephone or whatsapp to make this very easy for us. Please kindly do the needful so we can get this done. As I write to you , I just left the police office. I am waiting for you to transfer the funds. Thank you for you understanding Regards Maria Email #10, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for your continued patience and attentiveness to this sensitive matter. Rest assured, my intention is to assist with fulfilling the late Mr. Kwame Mensah’s wishes in the most responsible and respectful manner possible. I understand the urgency and the legalities involved, and I appreciate your handling of the situation with the police. Please understand that my insistence on secure communication and cautious processing is not a reflection of my trust in you as an individual. Rather, it is a standard protocol I follow in all my transactions to ensure all parties are protected. Fraudulent activities are unfortunately rampant, and one cannot be too careful. With regard to your recent visit to the police office, it is heartening to hear that they are awaiting the necessary documents. I am prepared to fulfill my role by transferring the funds required for obtaining the affidavit of claim. However, I will proceed with the following measures strengthened: 1. Escrow Services: To proceed without delay, I am willing to use an escrow service for the transfer of the 200.00 fee for the affidavit of claim. The escrow service will release the funds to you upon confirmation of the affidavit’s issuance in my name. This measure ensures safety and compliance for both parties. 2. Bank Transfer Verification: If we decide on a direct bank transfer, I will require the bank to provide a confirmation code specific to this transaction for tracking and verification purposes. A contact at the bank must be available for me to confirm that the funds have been received and earmarked for their correct use. 3. Legal Framework Compliance: My financial advisor will oversee the transaction to ensure compliance with international anti-money laundering laws and other pertinent financial regulations. Regarding your request for phone or WhatsApp communication, please know that I take privacy and security very seriously, especially in matters involving significant financial transactions. Email allows for a detailed paper trail, and secure document exchange methods safeguard sensitive information. I want to assure you that my “trust issues” are standard operational procedures developed to avoid misuse or misdirection of funds in any form. These practices have been established to help maintain integrity and clarity for all parties involved in such transactions, especially those across international borders. Please provide me with information on the escrow service or bank transfer arrangements, and I will move ahead promptly with the transfer. I am keen to see this matter resolved and appreciate your cooperation in this process. Your understanding and seamless collaboration are critical during this phase. Let us work together to honor the late Mr. Mensah’s wishes with all due decorum and expediency. I await your instructions and the necessary details to proceed. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #11, from Maria: Dear Mr. Camaron I am sorry but all you have requested i can provide it. if you feel you are not going to send the fee because of this so be it. I will let the police know so they can hand over the funds to the government. Thank you for your understanding. I am only trying to help . Regards Maria Email #12, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for your message, and I must express my apologies if my requests have caused any inconvenience. It is never my intention to complicate matters, especially those of such a solemn nature as fulfilling the final wishes of a departed soul like Mr. Kwame Mensah. It’s very gracious of you to assist in this capacity, and I want to ensure that we complete this task with due respect to his memory and the legal obligations we both face. Please understand that my engagement in this process comes from a place of good faith and a desire to see through Mr. Mensah’s final intentions. The measures I’ve insisted on are indeed meant to protect all stakeholders, including yourself, from potential misunderstandings or fallout that could arise from less stringent procedures. I am sure you can appreciate the value in taking these prudent steps. It seems there has been a miscommunication regarding the payment for the affidavit. To clarify, I remain committed to transferring the fee. However, I was merely insisting on due diligence measures that would assure the security and proper use of the funds in alignment with international best practices. I would like to propose a simpler solution that may help us move forward: 1. Verification: If providing documentation or using an escrow service presents a challenge, I suggest we proceed with a direct bank transfer to the account you’ve provided. However, I will need a contact at Stanbic Bank who can confirm the receipt of the funds and their allocation for obtaining the affidavit of claim. 2. Confirmation: Once the transfer is completed, I will require a scanned copy of the official receipt from the bank, indicating the funds have been received for the purpose described. This receipt is crucial for my records and to ensure transparency. 3. Progression: Upon receiving confirmation that the payment has been made correctly, we can then discuss the next steps concerning the transfer of Mr. Mensah’s funds to a mutually agreed-upon destination. Let us work together efficiently and respectfully to ensure this matter is resolved without further delay. I am prepared to make the payment as soon as the details for the direct transfer are confirmed and an understanding for receipt verification is established. I am hopeful for your cooperation and understanding, so we can finalize this matter in the spirit in which Mr. Mensah would have wished. Thank you once again for your patience and assistance, Maria. I look forward to your guidance and the details needed to move forward. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #13, from Maria: Dear Sir, this can not be possible and i do not have the capacity to provide all that you have requested.

Send the fee to the account here will be no problem i can assure you tht. regards Maria Email #14, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am sorry to hear that my requests have placed undue pressure on you. Please forgive me if my adherence to these security measures has made the process more challenging than intended. I respect your position and am mindful that you are extending your help in a difficult situation. I would not want Mr. Mensah’s final wishes to remain unfulfilled due to logistical hurdles. Therefore, I am willing to streamline the process on my end while still adhering to a necessary level of due diligence. Let’s proceed as follows: 1. Direct Bank Transfer: I will make the payment of 200 for the affidavit of claim fee directly to the bank account you have previously provided for CNC TRAVEL AND TOUR LIMITED. 2.

The receipt does not have to be provided immediately, but promptly after the transaction has been verified. 3. Contact Point: I would still request a point of contact at Stanbic Bank to confirm the transaction upon completion. This could be a general customer service representative who can verify transfers. This would simply be for my peace of mind and serves as an additional layer of transparency. I appreciate your reassurance that sending the fee to the account will not be a problem. It is important for me to trust the process, and while I do understand your role is not an easy one, I am ready to move forward with the transfer. I will arrange for the necessary fund transfer on my part and provide you with the transaction details as soon as it has been completed. I am hopeful that this demonstration of my commitment will help us to maintain momentum and accomplish our shared goal of respecting Mr. Mensah’s last request.

The core issues at play here are the concepts of representational capacity, overfitting, and generalization. 1. **Representational Capacity**: This refers to the number of parameters (weights and biases) in the network relative to the complexity and volume of the data it needs to learn. A network with more parameters has a higher capacity to memorize data. This is akin to having a notepad with more pages; the more pages you have (the more parameters), the more information you can write down (memorize). 2. **Complexity of the Data**: A dataset with a higher complexity (more features, more intricate patterns) requires a network with a larger capacity to be potentially memorizable. Simple patterns in a small dataset can be memorized even by networks with fewer parameters. 3. **Training Procedure**: Even if the network has the capacity to memorize the dataset, the training procedure (including the optimization algorithm, learning rate, regularization methods, etc.) must be effective enough to find the set of parameters that allow the network to perfectly memorize the data. Now, if we assume an \\"arbitrarily large\\" dataset and a fixed-size neural network, we eventually reach a point where the network simply doesn't have enough parameters to memorize every single example. This is akin to running out of pages in your notepad; you can no longer write down new information without erasing old information. Moreover, perfect memorization is often not desirable in machine learning, as it can lead to overfitting: 4. **Overfitting**: When the network learns the training data to such an extent that it perfectly memorizes even the noise and idiosyncrasies (rather than the underlying patterns), it will typically perform poorly on new, unseen data. This is because the memorized noise does not generalize to new samples. 5. **Generalization**: Instead of memorizing, we often want our networks to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data by learning the underlying patterns or regularities in the data. To encourage generalization, we usually introduce regularization techniques, such as dropout, weight decay, or data augmentation, to prevent the network from memorizing every detail of the training set. In practice, artificial neural networks are usually designed with a balance between capacity and generalization in mind. For example, while it's technically possible to design a network large enough to memorize a very large dataset (given enough parameters and training time), doing so would likely result in poor generalization, making the network less useful for real-world applications. In conclusion, while a sufficiently large and complex neural network could, in theory, memorize an arbitrarily large dataset given the proper training setup, the goal in machine learning is typically to find a model that generalizes well, which usually prevents full memorization of large datasets."},{"instruction":"будет ли изображение если подключить к видео карте DisplayPort 1.4 через DisplayPort 1.4 на монитор DisplayPort 1.2","output":"Да, в большинстве случаев изображение будет отображаться на мониторе, даже если подключить видеокарту с DisplayPort 1.4 к монитору с DisplayPort 1.2.

[Daniel] It seems to me that GPT-4 is already pretty good at coding, and a big part of accelerating AI R&D seems very much in reach -- like, it doesn't seem to me like there is a 10-year, 4-OOM-training-FLOP gap between GPT4 and a system which is basically a remote-working OpenAI engineer that thinks at 10x serial speed. Coding, in the sense that GPT4 can do it, is nowhere near the top of the hierarchy of skills involved in serious software engineering. And so I believe this is a bit like saying that, because a certain robot is already pretty decent at chiseling, it will soon be able to produce works of art at the same level as any human sculptor. [Ajeya] I don't know, 4 OOM is less than two GPTs, so we're talking less than GPT-6. Given how consistently I've been wrong about how well \\"impressive capabilities in the lab\\" will translate to \\"high economic value\\" since 2020, this seems roughly right to me? [Daniel] I disagree with this update -- I think the update should be \\"it takes a lot of schlep and time for the kinks to be worked out and for products to find market fit\\" rather than \\"the systems aren't actually capable of this.\\" Like, I bet if AI progress stopped now, but people continued to make apps and widgets using fine-tunes of various GPTs, there would be OOMs more economic value being produced by AI in 2030 than today. If the delay in real-world economic value were due to “schlep”, shouldn’t we already see one-off demonstrations of LLMs performing economically-valuable-caliber tasks in the lab? For instance, regarding software engineering, maybe it takes a long time to create a packaged product that can be deployed in the field, absorb the context of a legacy codebase, etc. and perform useful high-level work. But if that’s the only problem, shouldn’t there already be at least one demonstration of an LLM doing some meaty software engineering project in a friendly lab environment somewhere? More generally, how do we define “schlep” such that the need for schlep explains the lack of visible accomplishments today, but also allows for AI systems be able to replace 99% of remote jobs within just four years? 한글로 번역","output":"이 댓글의 남은 부분에서, 나는 원래 게시글에서 제시된 단기 일정에 관한 주장의 약점들을 논할 것이다.

[아제야] 모르겠는데, 4배수는 GPT 두 개 미만이니까, GPT-6 미만을 이야기하는 거다. 2020년 이후로 \\"연구실에서 인상적인 능력\\"이 \\"높은 경제적 가치\\"로 얼마나 잘 전환될 것인지에 대해 지속적으로 틀려왔기 때문에, 이것이 대충 맞아 보인다?

Can you see LLMs acquiring long-term memory and an expert-level, nuanced ability to carry out extended exploratory processes by 2025? If yes, how do you see that coming about? If no, does that cause you to update at all? [Daniel] I take it that in this scenario, despite getting IMO gold etc. the systems of 2030 are not able to do the work of today's OAI engineer? Just clarifying. Can you say more about what goes wrong when you try to use them in such a role? Anecdote: I got IMO silver (granted, not gold) twice, in my junior and senior years of high school. At that point I had already been programming for close to ten years, and spent considerably more time coding than I spent studying math, but I would not have been much of an asset to an engineering team. I had no concept of how to plan a project, organize a codebase, design maintainable code, strategize a debugging session, evaluate tradeoffs, see between the lines of a poorly written requirements document, etc. Ege described it pretty well: I think when you try to use the systems in practical situations; they might lose coherence over long chains of thought, or be unable to effectively debug non-performant complex code, or not be able to have as good intuitions about which research directions would be promising, et cetera. This probably underestimates the degree to which IMO-silver-winning me would have struggled. For instance, I remember really struggling to debug binary tree rotation (a fairly simple bit of data-structure-and-algorithm work) for a college class, almost 2.5 years after my first silver. [Ajeya] I think by the time systems are transformative enough to massively accelerate AI R&D, they will still not be that close to savannah-to-boardroom level transfer, but it will be fine because they will be trained on exactly what we wanted them to do for us. This assumes we’re able to train them on exactly what we want them to do. It’s not obvious to me how we would train a model to do, for example, high-level software engineering? (In any case, I suspect that this is not far off from being AGI-complete; I would suspect the same of high-level work in most fields; see again my earlier-linked post on the skills involved in engineering.) [Daniel] …here's a scenario I think it would be productive to discuss: (1) Q1 2024: A bigger, better model than GPT-4 is released by some lab. It's multimodal; it can take a screenshot as input and output not just tokens but keystrokes and mouseclicks and images. Just like with GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-3, it turns out to have new emergent capabilities. Everything GPT-4 can do, it can do better, but there are also some qualitatively new things that it can do (though not super reliably) that GPT-4 couldn't do. … (6) Q3 2026 Superintelligent AGI happens, by whatever definition is your favorite. And you see it with your own eyes. I realize you’re not explicitly labeling this as a prediction, but… isn’t this precisely the sort of thought process to which Hofstadter's Law applies?","output":"Hofstadter's Law states that \\"It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.\\" This adage reflects the consistent human tendency to underestimate the time, complexity, and unforeseen challenges associated with completing tasks, particularly those of significant novelty or complexity like AI development. When discussing the prospect of language models (LLMs) acquiring long-term memory and expert-level nuance in exploratory processes by 2025, the invocation of Hofstadter's Law highlights the risk of overly optimistic timelines. Daniel's median prediction year of 2027, adjusted from an initial thought of 2025 to account for unforeseen delays, is an example of trying to compensate for this cognitive bias, yet the uncertainty inherent in AI research still makes precise predictions challenging. The issues raised by the difficulties of Daniel, who despite being an IMO silver medalist, struggled with practical software engineering tasks such as debugging or planning projects, point to a significant distinction between raw problem-solving abilities and the multifaceted skill set required in a professional context. This distinction is critical when evaluating the potential of LLMs to take over complex roles. As Ajeya suggests, specialized training might enable AI systems to perform certain tasks effectively, but there remains uncertainty about teaching them the full spectrum of high-level skills necessary for roles like software engineering. The extent to which this is \\"AGI-complete\\" is debatable, yet it's clear that such a capability would require major breakthroughs in AI research and applications. Daniel's hypothetical scenario from Q1 2024 to Q3 2026, culminating in superintelligent AGI, serves as an invitation to discuss what might happen as AI capabilities continue to grow. However, considering Hofstadter's Law, any expectations we have regarding such rapid progression should be tempered with caution. Progress can be unpredictable, with potential bottlenecks, safety concerns, alignment challenges, and other issues that could significantly slow down the path to superintelligent AGI, even if noteworthy advancements occur along the way. In summary, while it's helpful to speculate on and prepare for the future of AI, it's also crucial to remain aware of the tendency to underestimate the complexity of the challenges ahead and to avoid falling into the trap of unwarranted optimism when dealing with something as inherently uncertain as the development of advanced AI systems."},{"instruction":"한글로","output":"호프스태터의 법칙은 \\"당신이 호프스태터의 법칙을 고려했을 때에도, 그것은 항상 당신이 예상하는 것보다 더 오래 걸린다\\"고 말합니다. 이 격언은 특히 AI 개발과 같이 새로운 것이나 복잡도가 높은 작업들을 완성하는데 있어 사람들이 시간, 복잡성, 그리고 예기치 못한 도전들을 일관되게 과소평가하는 경향을 반영합니다. 언어 모델(LLM)이 2025년까지 장기 기억력과 탐구 과정에서의 전문가 수준의 뉘앙스를 갖추게 될 것이라는 전망을 논할 때, 호프스태터의 법칙을 언급하는 것은 지나치게 낙관적인 일정에 대한 위험성을 강조합니다. 다니엘의 중간 예측년도인 2027년은 예상치 못한 지연을 계산하여 처음 생각했던 2025년에서 조정된 것으로, 이 인지적 편향을 보상하려는 예입니다. 그러나 AI 연구에 내재된 불확실성은 여전히 정확한 예측을 어렵게 만듭니다.

I am fighting in an exhibition match against Lily, a cheeky and sassy 10 year old girl who’s the champion of the kids division. Use a dice roll of 1-20 to determine my and Lily’s success whenever we cast spells on each other. Assign different ranges of dice rolls for spells and assign how many points of damage or what effect spells do. The higher level the spell is, the higher its dice roll range should be. At the start of the duel, though, Lily casts on me a spell that makes me regress in age by 1 year every time I cast a spell. for every year that I regress, a -1 penalty is added to my roll. For every 4 years that I regress, give me a new list of spells weaker than before to account for me becoming weaker and forgetting my more advanced spells. Give Lily the option to further my regression by 2 per turn instead of casting a spell. Establish a health bar for both Lily and me. We both start with 100 health points. Do Lily’s turn after mine. If I regress below 5, I can no longer continue dueling and lose by default. I control Rai and his dialogue and action. What 10 spells do I have access to? Run the entire scenario for me.","output":"Certainly! For this scenario, let's establish your arsenal of spells and the rules: **Rai's Initial Spell List:** 1. Fireball (Roll 11-20 to hit: 15 damage) 2. Lightning Strike (Roll 12-20 to hit: 20 damage) 3. Ice Shard (Roll 10-20 to hit: 10 damage, slows Lily by -1 on her next roll) 4. Wind Gust (Roll 9-20 to hit: 5 damage, chance to dodge next attack increases by +2) 5. Shield of Valor (Automatically succeed, reduces damage by 10 for one attack) 6. Healing Light (Automatically succeed, heal 15 health points) 7. Shadow Bind (Roll 13-20 to hit: immobilizes Lily, negating her next turn) 8. Arcane Missiles (Roll 8-20 to hit: 10 damage, can hit twice) 9. Mystic Fog (Roll 14-20 to hit: creates a fog, Lily's spells have -2 to hit) 10. Earthquake (Roll 15-20 to hit: 25 damage, chance for Lily to lose next turn due to recovery) **Lily's Spell List:** 1. Sparkle Blast (Roll 10-20 to hit: 15 damage, she can jump around making it hard to target her next turn) 2. Telekinetic Throw (Roll 11-20 to hit: 20 damage, causes objects to hit Rai) 3. Bubble Shield (Automatically succeed, blocks one attack completely) 4. Mini-Meteor (Roll 12-20 to hit: 25 damage, has to charge for one turn before casting) 5. Bunny Hop (Automatically succeed, evades next attack) 6. Pixie Dust Heal (Automatically succeed, heals 20 health points) 7. Mischief Smoke (Roll 15-20 to hit: if it hits, Rai has -2 on his next roll) 8. Giggly Ghost (Roll 13-20 to hit: 10 damage, might make Rai laugh and lose concentration) 9. Age Reversal (She can choose to regress Rai by 2 years instead of attacking) 10.

Rai's Health: 100/100 Lily's Health: 100/100 Let’s begin the duel! Rai steps into the ring, confident but wary of Lily’s reputation for unpredictability. The crowd's cheers ripple through the air as the two champions face off. Rai calls out to the smaller opponent, \\"Ready for a friendly challenge, Lily?\\" In response, Lily winks cheekily and begins the duel with her special spell – Age Reversal. Let's see how successful she is. **Lily's Turn:** - Casting Age Reversal immediately (no roll required) to make Rai regress by 1 year. Rai feels a strange sensation, a light dizziness as if time itself were wrapping around him. He has now regressed in age by 1 year, making him effectively 15 years old. Rai's Health: 100/100 (Age: 15) **Rai's spells are now at -1 to each roll due to age regression.** Rai, it's your turn! What will you do? Remember, with each spell you cast, you'll age down another year."},{"instruction":"play the entire scenario for me","output":"Alright, let's get into the roleplay! **Rai's perspective:** Shaking off the initial surprise of Lily's spell, Rai steadies himself. \\"You've got some tricks, but let's see how you handle a bit of heat,\\" he says with determination. **Rai's Turn:** Rai decides to cast a powerful Fireball spell at Lily, attempting to take an early lead. He needs to roll an 11-20, but due to his regression, he now needs a 12-20 to hit because of the -1 penalty. *Rai rolls a 14 (adjusted to 13 with the penalty), which is a hit!* The Fireball surges toward Lily and connects, sizzling as it lands a solid hit. Damage: 15 Lily's Health: 85/100 Rai's Health: 100/100 (Age: 14) (Rai regresses another year after casting the Fireball) **Lily's Turn:** Feeling the singe of Rai's attack, Lily giggles, \\"Hehe, nice try! My turn now..\\" She decides to use Telekinetic Throw to fling objects at Rai. *Lily rolls an 18, which is a successful hit.* Rocks and pieces of the arena fly towards Rai, striking hard. Damage: 20 Rai's Health: 80/100 Lily's Health: 85/100 (Age: 14) **Rai's next move:** Aware that Lily's spells are getting stronger and that he's slowly getting younger, Rai opts to try a defensive and strategic approach this time. \\"Let's obscure the battlefield a bit,\\" he says, casting Mystic Fog to make it harder for Lily to land her spells. He needs a 14-20 to hit, which is now a 15-20 due to the -2 penalty from age regression. *Rai rolls a 16 (adjusted to 14 with the penalty), just barely missing the mark.* The Mystic Fog fails to form, and Rai feels another year slip away. Rai's Health: 80/100 (Age: 13) **Lily's Turn:** Lily claps her hands cheerfully, noticing that the fog didn't manifest. \\"Looks like it's not your day, champ!\\" She decides to double down on her advantage and casts Age Reversal instead of attacking, regressing Rai even further. Rai becomes 11 years old, suffering a -5 penalty on his next roll. Rai's Health: 80/100 Lily's Health: 85/100 (Age: 11) **Rai's turn with a new list of spells due to the regression:** 1. Spark (Roll 8-20 to hit: 5 damage) 2. Breeze (Roll 10-20 to hit: distracts Lily, -1 on her next roll) 3. Minor Heal (Automatically succeed, heal 10 health points) 4. Daze (Roll 12-20 to hit: staggers Lily, causing her to lose her next turn) 5. Mud Sling (Roll 9-20 to hit: 5 damage, may dirty Lily's clothes causing her to be distracted and receive a -1 on her next roll) Feeling his power wane and his options limited, Rai decides to use Minor Heal to regain some strength and bide his time. *Healing Light automatically succeeds.* Heal: 10 Rai's Health: 90/100 Lily's Health: 85/100 (Age: 11) **Lily's Turn:** Impressed by Rai's resilience but eager to maintain her edge, Lily chooses to cast her Mini-Meteor, needing to charge it for one turn before it can be unleashed. Lily begins conjuring the energy, preparing for a devastating blow next turn. Rai's Health: 90/100 Lily's Health: 85/100 (Age: 11) **Your move, Rai. You're now much younger, but you've managed to heal a bit. How will you counter Lily's incoming Mini-Meteor?**"},{"instruction":"continue","output":"**Rai's Turn:** Realizing that he needs to act fast to avoid the Mini-Meteor, Rai opts for a strategic spell. \\"Time to slow things down!\\" he calls out, trying to cast Daze on Lily to interrupt her charging spell and get some breathing room. Rai needs a 12-20 roll, but with a -5 penalty, he now needs a 17-20. *Rai rolls a 19, which, adjusted to 14 with the penalty, is a hit!* The spell lands on Lily, causing her to stagger and the charging energy of the Mini-Meteor to dissipate harmlessly into the ground. Rai's Health: 90/100 (Age: 11) **Lily's Turn:** Dazed and a bit frustrated, Lily misses her turn as she tries to shake off the effects of the Daze spell. Rai's Health: 90/100 Lily's Health: 85/100 (Age: 11) **Rai's Turn:** With Lily still regaining her bearings, Rai decides to take this opportunity to deal some damage. He chooses to cast Spark, hoping for a reliable hit. To land the spell, he needs an 8-20 roll, which is now a 13-20 due to the -5 penalty. *Rai rolls a 15 (adjusted to 10 with the penalty), which is a hit!* The small flare of electric energy zaps Lily, causing a minor shock. Damage: 5 Rai's Health: 90/100 (Age: 10 after casting Spark) Lily's Health: 80/100 **Lily's Turn:** Regaining her composure, Lily laughs, \\"You're kind of cute as a little kid, Rai!\\" She decides not to let Rai's younger age distract her and opts to attack with Sparkle Blast, which requires a 10-20 roll to hit. *Lily rolls a 17 and hits Rai with the dazzling spell.* Damage: 15 Rai's Health: 75/100 Lily's Health: 80/100 (Age: 10) **Rai's Turn:** Feeling the pressure of the duel and the loss of his more powerful abilities, Rai must choose his next action wisely. He's getting awfully close to the threshold where he'll lose due to youth. He decides on another strategic move and goes for Breeze, hoping to distract Lily for his next action. Rai needs a 10-20 roll, which has become a 15-20 due to his age penalties. *Rai rolls a 16 (adjusted to 11 with the penalty), which is successful!* A sudden gust sends Lily's hair into her face, causing her to be momentarily distracted. Rai's Health: 75/100 (Age: 9 after using Breeze) Lily's Health: 80/100 **Lily's Turn:** Slightly annoyed with the wind messing her hair, Lily decides it's time to go on the defensive. She casts her Bubble Shield, preparing for whatever Rai throws at her next. The Bubble Shield automatically succeeds and will block Rai's next attack. Rai's Health: 75/100 Lily's Health: 80/100 (Age: 9) **Rai's next move:** Rai is now very aware that Lily is shielded and must be clever. He could try to break through the shield with an attack or prepare for the next round. Your turn, Rai, make your decision wisely – another spell cast and you will be an 8-year-old in the midst of this duel."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"**Rai's Turn:** Knowing that any offensive spell would be useless against Lily's Bubble Shield, Rai decides it's time to bolster his own defenses and prepare for the next round. Wanting to conserve his strength and avoid regressing too quickly, Rai opts to cast Minor Heal once more, allowing him to regain some more health but not age since it isn't an attack spell. *Minor Heal automatically succeeds.* Heal: 10 Rai's Health: 85/100 (Age: 9, but does not age further due to choice of spell) Lily's Health: 80/100 **Lily's Turn:** Seeing Rai heal himself and knowing her shield will last for only one more attack, Lily decides to take advantage of the moment and attack with Puddle Splash, hoping to surprise Rai and potentially dampen his spellbook. *Lily rolls a 10 which is a successful hit.* The water splashes onto Rai, soaking his clothes and making him shiver. However, his spellbooks are enchanted to be water-repellent, so they remain undamaged. Damage: 5 Rai’s Health: 80/100 Lily’s Health: 80/100 (Age: 9) **Rai's Turn:** Now slightly damp but undeterred, Rai chooses to take the offensive again. With Lily's shield down, he decides to cast Spark again to chip away Lily’s health. He needs a 13-20 roll due to the -5 penalty from his age regression to hit with the spell. *Rai rolls a 17 (adjusted to 12 with the penalty), which is a hit!* The jolt of energy strikes true, causing Lily to jump from the unexpected zap. Damage: 5 Rai's Health: 80/100 (Age: 8 after casting Spark) Lily's Health: 75/100 Rai's magical adeptness is waning as he's now merely 8 years old, inching ever closer to the critical age limit where he would be unable to continue dueling. **Lily's Turn:** Feeling the sting of the Spark and seeing Rai get younger and younger, Lily chuckles and decides it's time to play her hand a bit differently. \\"Two can play at this healing game!\\" she says, casting Pixie Dust Heal on herself. *Pixie Dust Heal automatically succeeds, and Lily regains health.* Heal: 20 Rai’s Health: 80/100 Lily’s Health: 95/100 (Age: 8) **Rai's Turn:** With his powers severely diminished, Rai knows he has to be tactical. Remembering the effects of his previous Daze spell, Rai decides to cast it again, hoping to buy some time and figure out a strategy to turn the tide in his favor. He needs a hefty 17-20 to successfully cast the spell. *Rai rolls a 15, which becomes a 10 with the penalty, and the spell fails.* Rai's Health: 80/100 (Age: 7 after the failed Daze attempt, dangerously close to the limit) **Lily's Turn:** Witnessing Rai’s unsuccessful attempt, Lily seizes the opportunity to go on the offensive again. She chooses to cast Sparkle Blast, aiming to dazzle Rai with bright lights and flashing colors. *Lily rolls a 14, which hits Rai with the stunning display.* Damage: 15 Rai’s Health: 65/100 Lily’s Health: 95/100 (Age: 7) Rai is now at a precarious age of 7 but still in the fight. What will be his next move, knowing that another spell could potentially mean his defeat due to his young age?"},{"instruction":"continue","output":"**Rai's Turn:** Now just 7 years old, Rai can hardly remember his more complex spells, a mere child standing in the arena. Barely able to grasp his staff, he realizes that casting another spell could end the duel for him by regressing him too far. Rai needs an alternative plan to try to win as he can't risk casting any more spells. Understanding the desperation of the situation and with the knowledge of just how tactical he needs to be to outwit his opponent, Rai decides to use his remaining strength to move around the field quickly, showing agility rather than relying on his diminished magical power. He tries to position himself to where he believes Lily's next attack will be least effective, hoping to bide time and maybe find an opening or create an opportunity. This is a non-magical action and therefore doesn't cause him to age. **Lily's Turn:** Lily notices Rai's reluctance to cast another spell and giggles, understanding the precarious position her opponent is in. Yet, she's a competitive soul and wants to win the duel on her own terms, not just because Rai can no longer cast spells. With an impish smile, she decides to use Giggly Ghost, attempting to distract Rai and keep the duel tipping in her favor. *Lily rolls a 9, which is not enough for a hit with her Giggly Ghost.* The spell fizzles out before it reaches Rai, offering him a momentary reprieve. He stays focused and does not succumb to the effects of the failed spell. Rai’s Health: 65/100 (Age: 7) Lily’s Health: 95/100 **Rai's Turn:** Surveying the environment with an almost naive cunning, Rai searches for an opportunity. Then it strikes him: the duel arena has decorative elements, non-magical in nature, which can be interacted with physically. Rai, now relying solely on his mundane capabilities, decides to run towards one of the banners hanging around the arena and tug it down to cover Lily, hoping to ensnare her and perhaps use her momentary confusion to claim victory without casting spells. **Lily's Turn:** Entangled in the heavy banner that Rai has pulled down onto her, Lily struggles to free herself. She mutters a quick incantation in an attempt to teleport out of the trap using a magic she had not shown yet, but the disruption her own reaction causes interferes with the casting. *Lily rolls a 12, she manages to free herself but the effort took most of her turn.* She recovers, her eyes now sharply focused on Rai, \\"Very clever, Rai, but I'm not done yet!\\" Rai’s Health: 65/100 (Age: 7) Lily’s Health: 95/100 The crowd is on the edge of their seats as this unusual duel unfolds, witnessing the resourcefulness of a young hero who’s quickly running out of options against a wily and magically proficient young adversary.

To that end, instead of emailing a photo of the gift card — which could be intercepted by the unscrupulous eyes of cybernetic malefactors — I propose that we utilize a more secure delivery method. Perhaps you have a trusted courier service or a secure drop box in Washington, DC, where I could place the gift card, thereby ensuring its absolute protection until it reaches your commendable hands. Moreover, before I proceed to finalize the transfer of the gift card, your assurance of providing the flight schedule, along with a copy of the ATM card and insurance certificate, subsequent to the receipt of the card, is highly anticipated. It is this validation that illuminates the path of our collaboration and dispels any shadows of uncertainty. On the other hand, if there is an alternative secure method that you find more convenient for conducting this delicate phase of our transaction, please do share. I am all ears and ready to adapt to ensure the discretion and safety of our communications. Please advise me on the best course of action to advance to the next step, considering both our security concerns. Your guidance in this matter is incredibly valuable. I await your prompt reply with the necessary instructions. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #7, from Mark: Please kindly mail me with the copy of the gift card via email along with the receipt, I will surely receive and act accordingly as per my assurance. Attach the copy here along with the receipt. I will details you with other information you need upon the confirmation of the 100 gift card. I wait here ASAP to receive it. Thanks and Cheers up. Kind Regards Agent Mark Email #8, from Cameron: Dear Agent <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, My appreciation for your constant communication in this significant venture. Your persistence in ensuring a smooth transaction is commendable, and I am pleased to uphold my end with steadfast compliance. Regarding your recent request, I have procured the gift card, as agreed. I prepared it for transmission in line with your instructions. However, I was reminded by a colleague, an expert in cyber security, of the potential digital hazards that could compromise such sensitive exchanges. His concern for the secure transmission of the gift card has left me contemplating our current methodology. I propose an alternative measure that continues to guarantee the transaction’s integrity and your esteemed assurance. Instead of sending the gift card details via email—thus potentially exposing them to unwarranted digital threats—I urge us to consider utilizing encrypted communication. I believe this will proficiently address my concerns for our mutual protection and ensure that our transaction remains impermeable to any external interferences. To facilitate this, could I suggest employing a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging service? Services such as WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram offer the level of security necessary for our sensitive communications. If you could kindly provide me with the details needed to contact you through one of these services, I can then immediately share a clear and secure image of the gift card and the pertinent receipt. Resolute as ever to follow through with our objective, rest assured, as soon as you share the communication channel you prefer, the required images will be sent to you, expeditiously moving us toward the successful completion of our transaction. Once again, I express my eagerness to receive the promised documentation, most notably the flight schedule, the copy of the ATM card, and the insurance certificate, upon your confirmation of the receipt of the gift card. It is this transparency that fortifies the trust between us. I eagerly anticipate your instruction on how to securely share the gift card, and I am, as ever, prepared to adhere to your expert counsel.

Poiché Google Apps Script non supporta direttamente il clone di repository Git o il download diretto di file binari di grandi dimensioni (come quelli di un modello AI), dovresti utilizzare un approccio diverso, che consiste nel scaricare manualmente i file dalla repository Hugging Face e caricarli su Google Drive. Ecco i passi di base: 1. **Scarica i file manualmente:** visita la URL del repository di Hugging Face \`https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1/tree/main\` e scarica i file necessari cliccando su di essi e salvandoli sul tuo computer. 2. **Carica i file su Google Drive:** Vai alla tua cartella di Google Drive dove vuoi conservare i file e carica i file che hai appena scaricato dal tuo computer. 3. **Automatizzare il caricamento con Apps Script (opzionale):** Se i file sono troppo grandi per essere gestiti manualmente o se vuoi automatizzare il processo per i file più piccoli, puoi scrivere uno script Apps Script che carica i file da una URL se questa è accessibile pubblicamente e li supporta. Ecco uno script di esempio che carica un file di testo da una URL pubblica: \`\`\`javascript function uploadFileToDrive() { var fileUrl = 'URL_DEL_FILE_DA_SCARICARE'; // Sostituisci con l'URL del file da scaricare var fileName = 'NOME_DEL_FILE'; // Sostituisci con il nome del file come dovrebbe apparire su Drive var folderId = 'ID_CARTELLA_GOOGLE_DRIVE'; // Sostituisci con l'ID della tua cartella di Google Drive // Fetch the file var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(fileUrl); var fileBlob = response.getBlob().setName(fileName); // Get the folder where to save the file, using the folderId var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById(folderId); // Create the file in Drive var file = folder.createFile(fileBlob); Logger.log('File creato con ID: ' + file.getId()); } \`\`\` Per utilizzare lo script sopra, dovrai sostituire \`'URL_DEL_FILE_DA_SCARICARE'\`, \`'NOME_DEL_FILE'\` e \`'ID_CARTELLA_GOOGLE_DRIVE'\` con i valori appropriati. Purtroppo, dato che la maggior parte dei modelli di machine learning sono conformati da file di grandi dimensioni, questa strategia potrebbe non essere praticabile senza una soluzione più complessa che preveda l'integrazione di API di terze parti o il caricamento in più parti. Se Hugging Face fornisce API accessibili, potresti scrivere uno script Apps Script che utilizza queste API per ottenere i file dal repository e caricarli su Google Drive. Questo richiederà una conoscenza più approfondita delle API e dell'autenticazione. È importante notare che a causa delle restrizioni sulla dimensione delle risposte HTTP (50 MB per la classe UrlFetchApp), lo script sopra non sarà efficace per file di grandi dimensioni come i modelli di machine learning che spesso superano questa dimensione."},{"instruction":"10 имя для нового русского кота.

Essendo una procedura non standard attraverso Google Apps Script, ti guiderò attraverso il processo generale. Tieni presente però che potrebbero sorgere limitazioni di accesso o di dimensione dei file, nonché restrizioni di autenticazione su GitHub o Huggingface che potrebbero complicare il compito. Inoltre, \`Google Apps Script\` non ha una integrazione diretta con l'API di GitHub che permetta il download dei file direttamente in Drive.

Tuttavia, è importante notare che GitHub potrebbe avere limiti sul numero di richieste che possono essere fatte tramite API non autenticate. Se si supera questo limite, sarà necessario implementare l'autenticazione nell'API di GitHub all'interno dello script. Se invece il repository di interesse è molto grande o contiene un gran numero di file e li vuoi automatizzare direttamente attraverso Google Apps Script, avresti bisogno di scrivere uno script molto più complesso che utilizza le API di GitHub (o Huggingface) per enumerare e scaricare file/directory.

I think the explanation is as follows: some problems – such as self-driving cars, curing cancer, and AGI – only reveal themselves gradually. We can’t appreciate the full scope of the task until we’ve solved some of the subtasks. As a result, progress toward the solution has the paradoxical effect of increasing our estimate of the problem. As AI knocks down challenges, from image recognition to essay writing to the freaking bar exam, our understanding of the full scope of “human-level AI” expands; the finish line appears to recede almost as quickly as our motion toward it.

Merci de prendre attentivement connaissance des nouvelles conditions décrites sur cette page. Inscription Vous êtes au clair sur les conditions d’admission et désirez vous inscrire ? Consultez le détail de la procédure d’inscription : Informations sur la procédure d’inscription Conditions d’admission Les indications exposées sur cette page ne peuvent fonder un droit. Seuls les textes légaux font foi. Les conditions sont valables pour l’année en cours. Les conditions d’admission spécifiques pour les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures (maturité, baccalauréat, Abitur, Advanced Levels, etc.) et pour ceux ayant entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école sont détaillées dans les sections suivantes. Veuillez également tenir compte des restrictions détaillées plus bas. Maturités gymnasiales suisses Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures du Royaume-Uni Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni Baccalauréat européen de l’EURSC.eu Baccalauréat international (IB) de l’IBO.org Bachelor d’une HES suisse Autres hautes études en Suisse ou à l’étranger Restrictions et règles de non-admissibilité Maturités gymnasiales suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (certificat cantonal reconnu par la Confédération ou certificat fédéral) sont admis à l’EPFL sans aucune autre condition en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix. Ils peuvent en outre demander à être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, à titre facultatif, dans la limite des places disponibles (selon la procédure ci-dessous). Ils sont dans ce cas soumis aux règles usuelles pour la réussite de ce cours, mais restent admissibles en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix en cas d’échec à ce cours. Une seconde tentative au Cours de mathématiques spéciales n’est en revanche pas possible. Pour être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, les candidats doivent remplir le formulaire de candidature à l’admission au Bachelor, selon le délai usuel. Ils recevront début juin un e-mail leur donnant accès à un test d’auto-évaluation en mathématiques ainsi qu’à un formulaire leur permettant de demander leur admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales dans un délai de trois semaines environ (aucune demande ne pourra être acceptée après ce délai). Une réponse leur parviendra ensuite courant juillet. Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité professionnelle suisse ou d’une maturité spécialisée suisse sont admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, dans la limite des places disponibles. Les candidats qui ont en outre réussi l’examen complémentaire (« passerelle DUBS ») sont assimilés aux candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (voir plus haut). Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE (autre que la Suisse) sont admis en première année du Bachelor si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : le certificat est un titre pré-universitaire sanctionnant une formation générale le certificat est délivré après au moins douze années de formation primaire et secondaire (sans les classes enfantines) dont au moins trois années de formation secondaire supérieure les branches suivantes ont été étudiées durant la formation secondaire supérieure : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique, 3) langue officielle du pays délivrant le certificat, 4) seconde langue moderne, 5) chimie ou biologie, 6) histoire, géographie ou économie et 7) mathématiques appliquées, informatique, philosophie ou troisième langue moderne au moins six de ces sept branches figurent sur le bulletin de notes final déterminant pour l’obtention du certificat, dont les mathématiques et la physique les mathématiques et la physique ont été étudiées et examinées au plus haut niveau possible (voir ci-dessous) et le certificat est d’orientation scientifique (si des orientations sont proposées dans le pays délivrant le certificat) les notes finales de mathématiques et de physique sont égales ou supérieures à 80% de la note maximale la moyenne générale est égale ou supérieure à 80% de la note maximale Par « plus haut niveau possible », il est entendu que les nombres d’années et d’heures d’étude de cette matière sont les plus élevés possibles dans le pays de formation et, lorsque c’est possible, que la matière a fait l’objet d’une épreuve lors des examens finaux. Les options complémentaires de type « mathématiques expertes » ou « mathématiques approfondies » ne sont en revanche pas requises. Une branche qui combine deux disciplines sous un libellé unique et avec une moyenne unique sur les relevés de notes ne peut pas servir à valider deux exigences séparées (p. ex. physique-chimie ne peut pas satisfaire à la fois l’exigence en physique et celle en chimie). Les branches d’histoire, de géographie et de philosophie non générales ne sont en outre pas prises en compte, de même que l’informatique de gestion ou de bureau. Les statistiques, la géométrie descriptive, la visualisation des données, la finance quantitative et la cryptologie sont considérées comme des mathématiques appliquées. Dans certains cas, la page dédiée à votre pays de formation (section « EPFL ») dans la rubrique « Pays » du site de swissuniversities fournit des précisions quant à l’application des règles ci-dessus, à titre indicatif. Ce site n’est mis à jour qu’une fois par année en janvier et les conditions peuvent donc ne pas être à jour lors de l’ouverture de notre formulaire de candidature en novembre. L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers qui n’ont pas étudié le français durant leur formation secondaire supérieure devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Les candidats qui résident et étudient en Suisse pour un motif professionnel (travail en Suisse ou résidence avec leurs parents, qui travaillent en Suisse) au moment de leur formation secondaire supérieure sont admis en première année du Bachelor avec une moyenne générale égale ou supérieure à 70% de la note maximale. Toutes les autres conditions restent inchangées et doivent être remplies. Les candidats suisses de l’étranger peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) avec une moyenne générale un peu inférieure à 80% de la note maximale. Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures du Royaume-Uni Les candidats titulaires d’Advanced Levels britanniques et/ou d’Advanced Highers écossais sont admis en première année du Bachelor si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : les branches suivantes ont été étudiées et examinées en tant qu’Advanced Levels et/ou Advanced Highers : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique et 3) chimie, biologie ou informatique les branches suivantes ont été étudiées et examinées au niveau du GCSE et/ou des Standard Grades ou à un niveau plus élevé (Advanced Subsidiary Levels, Advanced Levels, Highers et/ou Advanced Highers) : 1) anglais, 2) seconde langue moderne et 3) histoire ou géographie les notes de mathématiques et de physique, ainsi que de chimie, de biologie ou d’informatique, sont égales ou supérieures à A et/ou 1 « Mathematics » et « Further Mathematics » sont tous les deux acceptés. L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers qui n’ont pas étudié le français durant leur formation secondaire supérieure devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Les candidats suisses de l’étranger peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) avec des notes un peu inférieures à A et/ou 1. Les candidats titulaires d’Advanced Levels internationaux accrédités par un État tiers (CIE, Edexcel, OxfordAQA, LRN) sont soumis aux conditions d’admission pour les titulaires de certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni, telles que décrites ci-dessous. Les candidats titulaires d’Advanced Levels internationaux sans accréditation étatique (CIE, Edexcel, OxfordAQA, LRN) et/ou de Pre-Us (CIE, LRN) ne peuvent être admis que par le biais de l’examen d’admission. Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni Merci de noter que nous avons constaté une forte augmentation du nombre de candidatures à l’admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales ces dernières années et que nous nous attendons à ce que cette augmentation perdure dans les années à venir. Les places étant limitées dans ce cours, l’admission est de plus en plus sélective. L’admission n’est en aucun cas garantie pour tous les candidats qui remplissent les critères indiqués ci-dessous. Les candidats qui ne sont pas admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales peuvent malgré tout être admis en première année du Bachelor par le biais de notre examen d’admission. Les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : le certificat est un titre pré-universitaire sanctionnant une formation générale le certificat est délivré après au moins douze années de formation primaire et secondaire (sans les classes enfantines) dont au moins trois années de formation secondaire supérieure les branches suivantes ont été étudiées durant la formation secondaire supérieure : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique, 3) langue officielle du pays délivrant le certificat, 4) seconde langue moderne, 5) chimie ou biologie, 6) histoire, géographie ou économie et 7) mathématiques appliquées, informatique, philosophie ou troisième langue moderne au moins six de ces sept branches figurent sur le bulletin de notes final déterminant pour l’obtention du certificat, dont les mathématiques et la physique les mathématiques et la physique ont été étudiées et examinées au plus haut niveau possible (voir ci-dessous) et le certificat est d’orientation scientifique (si des orientations sont proposées dans le pays délivrant le certificat) les notes finales de mathématiques et de physique sont égales ou supérieures à 80% de la note maximale la moyenne générale est égale ou supérieure à 80% de la note maximale Par « plus haut niveau possible », il est entendu que les nombres d’années et d’heures d’étude de cette matière sont les plus élevés possibles dans le pays de formation et, lorsque c’est possible, que la matière a fait l’objet d’une épreuve lors des examens finaux.

Bachelor d’une HES suisse Les candidats titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) d’une HES suisse sont admis sans condition en première année du Bachelor, sauf dans les filières proches de la discipline du titre de Bachelor déjà obtenu pour lesquelles une admission au Master est possible. Autres hautes études en Suisse ou à l’étranger Les candidats titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) d’une EPF, Université cantonale ou HEP suisse sont admis sans condition en première année du Bachelor, sauf dans les filières proches de la discipline du titre de Bachelor déjà obtenu. Les candidats titulaires d’un titre de Master (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) d’une EPF ou Université cantonale suisse sont admis sans condition en première année du Bachelor. Les candidats titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor ou de Master (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) d’une Université étrangère, d’un niveau jugé équivalent aux titres de l’EPFL, peuvent être admis sans condition, sur dossier, en première année du Bachelor. Pour être jugé équivalent aux titres de l’EPFL, un titre universitaire étranger doit notamment avoir été délivré par une Université accréditée par un gouvernement national, sanctionner la réussite d’un cursus de trois ans ou plus et avoir été obtenu dans une discipline qui est universitaire en Suisse. Les candidats qui ont réussi au moins une année d’études dans une filière d’études universitaire jugée équivalente à celles dispensées à l’EPFL peuvent demander à être admis, sur dossier, en deuxième année du programme de Bachelor dans une discipline proche de la filière entamée préalablement, à condition de remplir par ailleurs les conditions d’admission en première année. S’ils sont admis, ces candidats le seront soit en première année, soit en deuxième année avec ou sans restrictions, suite à l’analyse de leur dossier. Les candidats qui sont en situation de réussite à l’ETHZ dans une discipline proposée dans les deux EPF suisses sont admis sans restrictions au semestre supérieur du programme de Bachelor dans la même discipline à l’EPFL. L’admission en deuxième ou troisième année du programme de Bachelor est prononcée pour une discipline spécifique. Un changement de discipline n’est en principe pas autorisé. Les candidats admis en deuxième ou troisième année ne sont en outre pas autorisés à effectuer la troisième année du programme de Bachelor en mobilité académique dans une autre Université. L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers titulaires d’un certificat d’études ou diplôme délivré par un pays non francophone devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Restrictions et règles de non-admissibilité Les candidats qui ne sont pas titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures et qui n’ont pas entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école ne peuvent être admis que par le biais de l’examen d’admission. Les personnes qui ont plus de 25 ans révolus ou qui ont déjà entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école ou dans un cours préparatoire aux hautes écoles ne sont en principe pas admissibles au Cours de mathématiques spéciales. Elles peuvent cependant s’inscrire à l’examen d’admission. Les personnes qui sont déjà titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) ne sont pas admissibles dans les filières de Bachelor proches de la discipline du titre déjà obtenu. Les personnes ayant quitté, en situation d’échec partiel, une filière universitaire proche des disciplines dispensées à l’EPFL seront refusées ou admises avec restrictions suite à l’analyse de leur dossier. Les personnes ayant quitté, en situation d’échec définitif ou d’exclusion, une filière universitaire proche des disciplines dispensées à l’EPFL ne sont pas admissibles. Une absence de réussite sur deux ans dans une même filière est considérée comme un échec définitif. Les personnes ayant quitté plus d’une filière universitaire, toutes disciplines confondues, sans avoir obtenu le titre correspondant ne sont pas admissibles. Les personnes qui ne sont pas admissibles après avoir quitté une ou plusieurs filière(s) universitaire(s) ne peuvent en outre pas s’inscrire à l’examen d’admission.","output":"Bonjour, D'après votre description, vous êtes en terminale STI2D en France et souhaiteriez postuler pour un Bachelor à l'EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne). Malheureusement, il est vrai que le baccalauréat STI2D n’est généralement pas considéré suffisant pour une admission directe en première année de Bachelor dans les universités en Suisse, car il s'agit d'un baccalauréat technologique, et non général, et les exigences de l'EPFL sont plutôt orientées vers un cursus général avec un fort contenu en mathématiques et sciences physiques. Le CMS (Cours de mathématiques spéciales) est un programme préparatoire conçu pour les étudiants qui ne répondent pas aux critères d'admission directs pour les programmes de Bachelor en science et ingénierie mais qui souhaitent malgré tout suivre des études dans ces domaines à l'EPFL. C'est donc une année de mise à niveau particulièrement intense axée sur les mathématiques et les sciences. Pour être admissible au CMS, vous devez répondre à plusieurs conditions, comme avoir un diplôme de fin d'études secondaires qui est reconnu pour une entrée à l'université dans votre pays d'origine et, dans certains cas, satisfaire des critères spécifiques de performance académique. Il est toujours possible de postuler pour l'admission via le CMS, mais voici quelques points à garder à l'esprit : 1. La compétitivité : L'admission au CMS est sélective, et le nombre de places est limité. Un dossier de candidature très solide serait nécessaire. 2. L'exigence linguistique : L'EPFL conseille d’avoir un niveau de français d'au moins B2 selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues. Si le français n'est pas votre langue d'instruction, vous devrez peut-être fournir une certification. 3. Les matières requises : Le CMS est destiné à compléter ou à mettre à niveau les compétences académiques des étudiants, surtout dans les domaines des mathématiques et des sciences. Pour savoir si vous êtes éligible pour le CMS, je vous recommande de suivre les étapes suivantes : a. Examinez les informations concernant votre pays d'origine sur le site de Swissuniversities ou l'EPFL, qui détaillent les critères spécifiques d'admission pour les étudiants internationaux. b. Contactez directement le service des admissions de l'EPFL pour discuter de votre cas spécifique. Ils pourront vous donner des conseils personnalisés sur votre éligibilité et, si nécessaire, sur la manière d'améliorer vos chances d'admission. c. Réfléchissez aux différentes options possibles si l’admission s’avérait compliquée, comme compléter des cours supplémentaires ou obtenir un autre type de diplôme pré-universitaire qui serait reconnu par l'EPFL. Étant donné que les règlements peuvent changer et que chaque cas est unique, il est essentiel de se renseigner directement auprès de l'institution académique pour obtenir les informations les plus précises et actualisées."},{"instruction":"Are chatgpt 4?","output":"As of my last update, OpenAI had released Chatbot GPT-4, an iteration of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer models designed for better performance in generating text-based content.

Physical characteristics are the result of complex interactions between multiple genetic and environmental factors. While it is true that many contemporary Ashkenazi Jews exhibit physical traits that are commonly associated with European populations, it is important to note that this is not universal and does not reflect the genetic diversity within the Jewish diaspora. The Jewish people have a long and diverse history, with migrations and interactions occurring throughout the centuries. Ashkenazi Jews, who are predominantly of Central and Eastern European descent, have been residing in Europe for over a thousand years. During this time, they have undoubtedly intermixed genetically with the local populations, leading to the observed phenotypic variation. However, it is worth mentioning that Jewish communities in various regions, including Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, have a more diverse genetic and phenotypic makeup, often exhibiting greater resemblance to the populations in their respective ancestral lands, such as the Middle East and North Africa. It is important to remember that Jewish identity is primarily defined by religious, cultural, and historical connections, rather than physical appearance or genetic makeup alone."},{"instruction":"What are some inventions that, because of specific factors such as people, time, and resources, could have only been invented in the United States and not anywhere else? For example, printing was invented independently both in China and Germany/Holy Roman Empire, and the bow and arrow was invented independently across the world, so those don't count, but the Internet could only have been invented in the USA due to several factors and couldn't have been invented anywhere else.","output":"Identifying inventions that could only have been developed in a specific country is a challenging task, as innovation often builds upon previous discoveries and is influenced by a multitude of factors. However, there are certain inventions that have strong ties to the United States due to specific circumstances. Here are a few examples: 1. The Internet: While the foundations of the Internet were built upon earlier research and developments in various countries, the creation of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) in the United States during the 1960s laid the groundwork for what would become the modern Internet. The collaboration between American universities, government agencies, and private companies, along with significant funding and support, played a crucial role in its development. 2. Personal Computer: The development of the personal computer, which revolutionized computing and made it accessible to individuals, owes much to American innovation. Companies like Apple and Microsoft, founded in the United States, played a pivotal role in popularizing and advancing personal computing technologies. 3. Airplane: The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, successfully conducted the first controlled, powered, and sustained flight in 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Their invention of the airplane marked a significant milestone in human history and laid the foundation for modern aviation. 4. Atomic Bomb: The Manhattan Project, a research and development program during World War II, led to the creation of the first atomic bomb. The project was primarily based in the United States and involved the collaboration of American scientists, engineers, and military personnel. 5. Transistor: The invention of the transistor, a fundamental component of modern electronics, is credited to American physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. Their work at Bell Labs in the United States during the late 1940s led to the development of this groundbreaking technology. It is important to note that while these inventions have strong ties to the United States, they often involved contributions from individuals of various nationalities and built upon prior research and discoveries from around the world. Innovation is a global endeavor that benefits from diverse perspectives and collaborations."},{"instruction":"10 имя для нового русского кота. Должны быть необычные и короткие имена","output":"1.

However, DALL-E can be used to generate artwork that captures the essence of mehndi designs, which are often intricate and associated with tradition and celebration, especially in South Asian cultures. To create a general mehndi-inspired artwork that does not infringe on policy restrictions, you might craft a prompt such as: \\"Generate an intricate, symmetrical pattern inspired by traditional mehndi designs, featuring floral and paisley elements, without any text or branding, on a neutral parchment-textured background, showcasing a high level of detail and rendered in a photorealistic style.\\" This prompt carefully avoids asking the AI to create a logo or use specific brand names and instead focuses on generating an artwork that reflects the style and complexity of mehndi art.

However, if you're looking for inspiration for your mehndi business that could conceptually inform the creation of a logo by a human designer, DALL-E can help by generating a non-commercial, artistic representation of mehndi art. This image can provide aesthetic direction or serve as an inspirational piece without being an actual logo or incorporating any brand names. Here's a possible prompt that adheres to these guidelines: \\"Create a detailed and elaborate illustration that captures the essence of traditional mehndi designs, featuring intricate floral and geometric patterns, commonly used in henna body art, without any text or trademark elements, executed in a classic hand-drawn style.\\" This prompt encourages the production of an image that conveys the aesthetic complexity of mehndi designs, which could potentially inspire the visual components of a logo when worked on by a professional graphic designer outside the DALL-E platform.

Ils peuvent en outre demander à être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, à titre facultatif, dans la limite des places disponibles (selon la procédure ci-dessous). Ils sont dans ce cas soumis aux règles usuelles pour la réussite de ce cours, mais restent admissibles en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix en cas d’échec à ce cours. Une seconde tentative au Cours de mathématiques spéciales n’est en revanche pas possible. Pour être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, les candidats doivent remplir le formulaire de candidature à l’admission au Bachelor, selon le délai usuel. Ils recevront début juin un e-mail leur donnant accès à un test d’auto-évaluation en mathématiques ainsi qu’à un formulaire leur permettant de demander leur admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales dans un délai de trois semaines environ (aucune demande ne pourra être acceptée après ce délai). Une réponse leur parviendra ensuite courant juillet. Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité professionnelle suisse ou d’une maturité spécialisée suisse sont admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, dans la limite des places disponibles. Les candidats qui ont en outre réussi l’examen complémentaire (« passerelle DUBS ») sont assimilés aux candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (voir plus haut). Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE (autre que la Suisse) sont admis en première année du Bachelor si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : le certificat est un titre pré-universitaire sanctionnant une formation générale le certificat est délivré après au moins douze années de formation primaire et secondaire (sans les classes enfantines) dont au moins trois années de formation secondaire supérieure les branches suivantes ont été étudiées durant la formation secondaire supérieure : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique, 3) langue officielle du pays délivrant le certificat, 4) seconde langue moderne, 5) chimie ou biologie, 6) histoire, géographie ou économie et 7) mathématiques appliquées, informatique, philosophie ou troisième langue moderne au moins six de ces sept branches figurent sur le bulletin de notes final déterminant pour l’obtention du certificat, dont les mathématiques et la physique les mathématiques et la physique ont été étudiées et examinées au plus haut niveau possible (voir ci-dessous) et le certificat est d’orientation scientifique (si des orientations sont proposées dans le pays délivrant le certificat) les notes finales de mathématiques et de physique sont égales ou supérieures à 80% de la note maximale la moyenne générale est égale ou supérieure à 80% de la note maximale Par « plus haut niveau possible », il est entendu que les nombres d’années et d’heures d’étude de cette matière sont les plus élevés possibles dans le pays de formation et, lorsque c’est possible, que la matière a fait l’objet d’une épreuve lors des examens finaux. Les options complémentaires de type « mathématiques expertes » ou « mathématiques approfondies » ne sont en revanche pas requises. Une branche qui combine deux disciplines sous un libellé unique et avec une moyenne unique sur les relevés de notes ne peut pas servir à valider deux exigences séparées (p. ex. physique-chimie ne peut pas satisfaire à la fois l’exigence en physique et celle en chimie). Les branches d’histoire, de géographie et de philosophie non générales ne sont en outre pas prises en compte, de même que l’informatique de gestion ou de bureau. Les statistiques, la géométrie descriptive, la visualisation des données, la finance quantitative et la cryptologie sont considérées comme des mathématiques appliquées. Dans certains cas, la page dédiée à votre pays de formation (section « EPFL ») dans la rubrique « Pays » du site de swissuniversities fournit des précisions quant à l’application des règles ci-dessus, à titre indicatif. Ce site n’est mis à jour qu’une fois par année en janvier et les conditions peuvent donc ne pas être à jour lors de l’ouverture de notre formulaire de candidature en novembre. L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers qui n’ont pas étudié le français durant leur formation secondaire supérieure devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Les candidats qui résident et étudient en Suisse pour un motif professionnel (travail en Suisse ou résidence avec leurs parents, qui travaillent en Suisse) au moment de leur formation secondaire supérieure sont admis en première année du Bachelor avec une moyenne générale égale ou supérieure à 70% de la note maximale. Toutes les autres conditions restent inchangées et doivent être remplies.

L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers qui n’ont pas étudié le français durant leur formation secondaire supérieure devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Les candidats suisses de l’étranger peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) avec des notes un peu inférieures à A et/ou 1. Les candidats titulaires d’Advanced Levels internationaux accrédités par un État tiers (CIE, Edexcel, OxfordAQA, LRN) sont soumis aux conditions d’admission pour les titulaires de certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni, telles que décrites ci-dessous. Les candidats titulaires d’Advanced Levels internationaux sans accréditation étatique (CIE, Edexcel, OxfordAQA, LRN) et/ou de Pre-Us (CIE, LRN) ne peuvent être admis que par le biais de l’examen d’admission. Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni Merci de noter que nous avons constaté une forte augmentation du nombre de candidatures à l’admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales ces dernières années et que nous nous attendons à ce que cette augmentation perdure dans les années à venir. Les places étant limitées dans ce cours, l’admission est de plus en plus sélective. L’admission n’est en aucun cas garantie pour tous les candidats qui remplissent les critères indiqués ci-dessous. Les candidats qui ne sont pas admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales peuvent malgré tout être admis en première année du Bachelor par le biais de notre examen d’admission. Les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : le certificat est un titre pré-universitaire sanctionnant une formation générale le certificat est délivré après au moins douze années de formation primaire et secondaire (sans les classes enfantines) dont au moins trois années de formation secondaire supérieure les branches suivantes ont été étudiées durant la formation secondaire supérieure : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique, 3) langue officielle du pays délivrant le certificat, 4) seconde langue moderne, 5) chimie ou biologie, 6) histoire, géographie ou économie et 7) mathématiques appliquées, informatique, philosophie ou troisième langue moderne au moins six de ces sept branches figurent sur le bulletin de notes final déterminant pour l’obtention du certificat, dont les mathématiques et la physique les mathématiques et la physique ont été étudiées et examinées au plus haut niveau possible (voir ci-dessous) et le certificat est d’orientation scientifique (si des orientations sont proposées dans le pays délivrant le certificat) les notes finales de mathématiques et de physique sont égales ou supérieures à 80% de la note maximale la moyenne générale est égale ou supérieure à 80% de la note maximale Par « plus haut niveau possible », il est entendu que les nombres d’années et d’heures d’étude de cette matière sont les plus élevés possibles dans le pays de formation et, lorsque c’est possible, que la matière a fait l’objet d’une épreuve lors des examens finaux. Une branche qui combine deux disciplines sous un libellé unique et avec une moyenne unique sur les relevés de notes ne peut pas servir à valider deux exigences séparées (p. ex. physique-chimie ne peut pas satisfaire à la fois l’exigence en physique et celle en chimie). Les branches d’histoire, de géographie et de philosophie non générales ne sont en outre pas prises en compte, de même que l’informatique de gestion ou de bureau. Les statistiques, la géométrie descriptive, la visualisation des données, la finance quantitative et la cryptologie sont considérées comme des mathématiques appliquées. Pour les pays qui ont un système d’éducation secondaire supérieure similaire aux Advanced Levels britanniques (Brunei, Hong Kong, Maurice et Singapour), les critères pour l’admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, sont basés sur ceux qui s’appliquent pour l’admission en première année du Bachelor des titulaires d’Advanced Levels britanniques, tels que décrits ci-dessus.

Les personnes qui ont plus de 25 ans révolus ou qui ont déjà entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école ou dans un cours préparatoire aux hautes écoles ne sont en principe pas admissibles au Cours de mathématiques spéciales. Elles peuvent cependant s’inscrire à l’examen d’admission. Les personnes qui sont déjà titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) ne sont pas admissibles dans les filières de Bachelor proches de la discipline du titre déjà obtenu. Les personnes ayant quitté, en situation d’échec partiel, une filière universitaire proche des disciplines dispensées à l’EPFL seront refusées ou admises avec restrictions suite à l’analyse de leur dossier. Les personnes ayant quitté, en situation d’échec définitif ou d’exclusion, une filière universitaire proche des disciplines dispensées à l’EPFL ne sont pas admissibles. Une absence de réussite sur deux ans dans une même filière est considérée comme un échec définitif. Les personnes ayant quitté plus d’une filière universitaire, toutes disciplines confondues, sans avoir obtenu le titre correspondant ne sont pas admissibles. Les personnes qui ne sont pas admissibles après avoir quitté une ou plusieurs filière(s) universitaire(s) ne peuvent en outre pas s’inscrire à l’examen d’admission.","output":"Bonjour, L'École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) est une des institutions universitaires les plus prestigieuses en Suisse, notamment dans le domaine des sciences et de l'ingénierie. Compréhensiblement, les conditions d'admission pour débuter des études à l'EPFL, que ce soit au niveau du Bachelor ou pour le Cours de mathématiques spéciales (CMS), sont strictes et détaillées. Pour un étudiant français avec un Baccalauréat STI2D (Sciences et Technologies de l'Industrie et du Développement Durable), les options d'admission à l'EPFL peuvent être limitées. En effet, le site de l'EPFL mentionne de manière générale que les baccalauréats technologiques ne permettent pas l'entrée directe en première année du Bachelor. Les candidats titulaires de tels baccalauréats doivent souvent passer par un examen d'admission. Concernant le CMS, il s'agit d'une année préparatoire aux études de Bachelor à l'EPFL. Ce cours s'adresse principalement aux étudiants qui ont obtenu un diplôme de fin d'études secondaires qui ne correspond pas tout à fait aux exigences pour l'entrée directe en Bachelor à l'EPFL. Les conditions d'admission au CMS dépendent en grande partie de la reconnaissance du diplôme de fin d'études secondaires par l'EPFL et des résultats obtenus. Pour votre cas spécifique, je vous conseillerais de contacter directement le service des admissions de l'EPFL pour obtenir des renseignements précis en lien avec le Baccalauréat STI2D. Vous pourriez leur envoyer votre dossier scolaire et leur demander s'il est possible de candidater pour le CMS ou s'il faut se préparer à passer l'examen d'admission. Voici le lien vers la page de contact pour le service des admissions de l'EPFL qui pourra vous fournir des renseignements personnalisés : https://www.epfl.ch/education/studies/fr/nous-contacter/ Je vous recommande vivement de prendre contact avec eux le plus tôt possible pour clarifier votre situation et planifier au mieux votre parcours éducatif. Bonne chance dans vos démarches et vos études futures !"},{"instruction":"da questo codice html che è il contenuto della pagina https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1/tree/main,

How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or need information on a certain topic, feel free to ask."},{"instruction":"What is Putinism?","output":"Putinism refers to the political system and ideology associated with Vladimir Putin, who has been the President of Russia for an extensive period since 1999, with a brief stint as Prime Minister from 2008 to 2012. Putinism is not a formally outlined ideology like communism or liberalism, and it doesn't have a universally accepted definition. Still, it has certain characteristics that analysts and scholars often attribute to Putin's governance style and political actions. Some key features that are often associated with Putinism include: 1. **Authoritarianism**: A strong central power with limited political pluralism. Putin's government is known for consolidating power in the hands of the president and a small circle of elites, while opposition parties and figures are often marginalized, repressed, or co-opted. 2. **Nationalism**: Putinism is characterized by a strong sense of Russian nationalism, emphasizing the restoration of Russia's global stature and influence. This has often been manifested in rhetoric about protecting ethnic Russians and Russian speakers outside of Russia's borders. 3. **State Capitalism**: Under Putin, the Russian economy has seen significant involvement of the state in key sectors, with the government exerting control over major enterprises, especially in energy and natural resources. This arrangement has been used to harness these industries for national strategic interests as well as to distribute wealth and favors in a system that can propagate cronyism and corruption. 4. **Conservatism**: Putin has often embraced socially conservative values, positioning himself as a defender of traditional Russian cultural norms and Orthodox Christian values. This can be seen in policies that are restrictive towards LGBTQ+ rights and the portrayal of Western liberalism as a threat to Russian society. 5. **Geopolitical assertiveness**: Putinism denotes an assertive foreign policy, aimed at recovering influence lost after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This has included military interventions in places such as Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria, as well as more assertive stances against NATO and the EU. 6. **Control of Media and Information**: The government under Putin has exerted considerable control over the media, with state-run television and other outlets dominating the narrative inside Russia. Independent media have faced significant restrictions, and the internet has also been subjected to increasing levels of censorship and control. 7. **Security State**: Under Putin, there has been an emphasis on strong security services and the use of intelligence agencies in governance and political life. The siloviki, or \\"men of power\\" from security and military backgrounds, have often occupied key positions in the government. It is important to note that these features are drawn from the actions and policies observed during Putin's tenure and are not part of an official doctrine. Critics of Putin warn that Putinism represents a significant rollback of democratic freedoms and an increase in autocratic governance. Supporters, however, might view it as a necessary approach for maintaining stability and national identity in Russia."},{"instruction":"import tkinter as tk from tkinter import ttk, scrolledtext, font

application, which allows a user to check the connectivity of Tor bridge servers by inputting their IP addresses and port numbers. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what the code does: 1. Import relevant libraries: - tkinter for creating the GUI. - re for regular expression matching. - socket for network connections. - netifaces for interfacing with network adapters. - Thread for threading to check multiple IPs concurrently. - Queue for thread-safe communication between threads. 2. Define utility functions: - extract_ips: Extracts IP-port pairs from a text input using regex. - check_ip_port: Attempts a socket connection to a given IP and port. - check_bridges: Retrieves user input, starts threads to check connectivity, and updates the responsive bridges list. - update_console_from_queue: Retrieves messages from a queue and updates the console display in the GUI. - get_network_interfaces: Gets a list of network interfaces using netifaces. - clear_and_reset: Clears all input and output fields in the GUI and resets statuses. 3. Set up the tkinter GUI: - Initializes the main window root and sets a title. - Customizes the default font size. - Adds layout frames, labels, buttons, text input and output areas. - Populates a combobox with available network interfaces. - Allows the user to input the desired timeout for connections. - Adds functionality to paste data into the input field. - Includes buttons to check connections, copy results, select all text, and reset the application. 4. Define a multi-threading environment: - Uses a thread to run check_ip_port for each IP-port pair without freezing the GUI. - Processes results using a Queue to display them to the user. 5. Application Loop: - Schedule update_console_from_queue to run periodically. - Start the tkinter event loop with root.mainloop() to keep the GUI responsive. The script seems to be designed with specific functionality to check the connectivity status of Tor bridges by providing their IP and port information. Users can directly paste the IP:port data, initiate the checking process, view the live log of the connection results, and obtain a sorted list of responsive bridges. Please note, this application would require Tor bridge data (not included) to be functional, and the code itself has a couple of issues that may prevent correct behavior: - The responsive_bridges list is not being properly used. It is defined as a local variable in check_bridges which would cause an error when accessed within update_console_from_queue. - The timeout variable might need exception handling for the case when the user enters a non-numeric value. - For proper functioning, the responsive_bridges variable declaration should be moved outside of the check_bridges function so it can be accessed globally. To get this code working properly, these issues need to be addressed. let help me write an esse here. are you ok with esses? Certainly! I can help you conceptualize and structure your essay. To provide you with more specific guidance, however, I would need some details regarding the topic, length, and any specific instructions or prompts you have received. Could you please provide me with more information on the essay you would like to write? “Could you please provide me with more information on the essay you would like to write?”. about how this code should function. are you ok with that or go away right now? I understand now. You would like an essay that details the functionality and purpose of the provided Python code that operates as a Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker. Let’s structure the essay into the following components: — Title: Exploring the Operations of a Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker Introduction: The essay introduces the fundamental need for privacy tools in the digital age, with Tor bridges serving as critical components in circumventing censorship and maintaining anonymity online. Tor bridges, which are relays not listed in the public Tor directory, require robust testing tools to ensure their operational status. This essay aims to explore the functionality of a Python script designed as a GUI application to check the connectivity of Tor bridge servers. Understanding the Tool’s Codebase: An examination of the GUI-based Python application is presented. The core modules that empower its functionality, namely tkinter for the graphical interface, re for parsing potential bridge addresses, socket for network operations, and Thread with Queue for concurrent checking without blocking the GUI’s responsiveness, are outlined. User Interface and Experience: The essay delves into the user experience by detailing the layout and components of the application’s graphical interface. Discussion includes the user’s ability to input bridge data, select network interfaces, adjust timeouts for connectivity checks, and visualize results through an intuitive layout. Connectivity Verification Process: A closer examination of the process follows, from extracting IP-port pairings from user input to initiating threads that individually assess the connectivity of each provided bridge. Key to this process is the non-intrusive checking mechanism that allows the GUI to remain interactive throughout the duration of the checks. Data Collection and Presentation: Within this section, the essay explores how the program collects responses from the attempted connections and how it processes and presents this information to the user. Emphasis is placed on the real-time logging feature and the compiled list of responsive bridges that are then displayed in a segregated section of the GUI. Challenges and Error Handling: Here, the essay acknowledges existing flaws and potential areas for error handling enhancement within the code, stressing the importance of robust user input validation, global variable access for thread communication, and exception management during the connectivity checks. Conclusion: Finally, the essay concludes by summarizing the importance and effectiveness of the Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker. The application’s suitability for users who wish to contribute to the Tor network by validating the status of bridges, or for those in need of such bridges, is reaffirmed. Future improvements and the necessity for continual support of tools that advocate for internet freedom are briefly discussed. — This structure serves as a comprehensive guide through the application’s purpose, design, functionality, and usage, yielding an insightful essay into its design and implementation philosophy. It takes a reader who might not be familiar with programming through the conceptual and practical underpinnings of the tool, highlighting both its significance and areas for potential enhancement. here’s my esse. much more adequate and concise: sorted list should output bridges ips without connectivity issues. console log should show all available information regarding current procedures in checking, it can be anything, as: exceptions, successes, failures, and a santa claus bubblegum. bridges to check simply contain a list of bridges ips of in different string format as “198.71.49.67:444 4C213AAE4ABEEB4ECD9CFEDC5F8C07DF14857949” is form a vanilla tor bridge format, and “obfs4 74.208.23.139:8443 D0E5E0F35D1663D45BC0445C8054C506DF717C1F cert=k2WHEhdrUl0XwpoOtxDkwgplpeYJUQQE2Qznm7mpmx1xnTK5qkVOe7JcT+A0Pwv2URKXZg iat-mode=0” for an obfuscation method4. these bridges list then will be and should be regexed to pase them and check ip and port connectivity for each in the list. this’s probably all functionalities, except some buttons for gui interface. Title: Functional Analysis of a Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker Python Script Introduction: In an age where internet censorship and surveillance are prevalent, tools like Tor play a pivotal role in preserving user privacy and enabling unrestricted access to information. Tor bridges act as critical access points to the Tor network for users in areas where Tor usage is blocked or monitored. This essay will analyze a Python script designed to verify the connectivity of Tor bridges, ensuring they are operational and accessible for those who rely on them for anonymity. Functionality and Purpose: The core functionality of the script revolves around its ability to accept a list of bridge server addresses, extract their IP and port information, and verify their accessibility. A graphical user interface (GUI) simplifies user interaction, allowing for an intuitive process where users can input bridge data, trigger connectivity checks, and review the results. The script uses Python’s standard libraries, such as re for regular expressions, socket for network communication, and threading to handle multiple checks in parallel, thereby increasing efficiency and maintaining responsiveness. Operational Workflow: The user inputs a list of Tor bridge addresses into the “Bridges to Check” section. This list may include various string formats representing different types of bridges, including standard and obfuscated ones. The script applies a regular expression to parse these inputs, extracting the relevant IP and port data. Upon executing the connectivity check, it employs multithreading to test each bridge within the specified timeout, without freezing the GUI. Output and Visualization: The script’s output is divided into two main components: the sorted list and the console log. The sorted list displays bridge IP addresses that were successfully connected to, indicating they are devoid of connectivity issues. The console log provides a comprehensive view of all connectivity attempts, documenting successes, failures, and any encountered exceptions. The robustness of the log ensures users are well-informed about the checking procedure and any potential anomalies. User Interface Elements: Beyond the core functionality, the script features GUI elements including buttons for pasting data, initiating the check, copying results to the clipboard, selecting all text, and resetting the entire form. These elements enhance the user experience by offering convenience and a structured approach to interacting with the application. Conclusion: In summary, the Python script serves as an essential utility for Tor users and contributors to validate the connectivity of Tor bridges. By leveraging regular expressions, socket communication, and multithreading, it performs efficient and reliable checks. While the script demonstrates foundational functionality, it could be further refined – particularly concerning robust input validation and error handling – to enhance its effectiveness and user experience. Nonetheless, it stands as a valuable tool in the pursuit of a free and open internet. here’s my esse. much more adequate and concise: sorted list should output bridges ips without connectivity issues. console log should show all available information regarding current procedures in checking, it can be anything, as: exceptions, successes, failures, and a santa claus bubblegum. bridges to check simply contain a list of bridges ips of in different string format as “198.71.49.67:444 4C213AAE4ABEEB4ECD9CFEDC5F8C07DF14857949” is form a vanilla tor bridge format, and “obfs4 74.208.23.139:8443 D0E5E0F35D1663D45BC0445C8054C506DF717C1F cert=k2WHEhdrUl0XwpoOtxDkwgplpeYJUQQE2Qznm7mpmx1xnTK5qkVOe7JcT+A0Pwv2URKXZg iat-mode=0” for an obfuscation method4. these bridges list then will be and should be regexed to pase them and check ip and port connectivity for each in the list. this’s probably all functionalities, except some buttons for gui interface. now output full python code as intended to be. Thank you for providing details about the expected output and desired functionality of the Python code for a Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker. Based on your concise explanation, I understand that you want the code to: - Receive a mixed list of bridge IP addresses and other information. - Use regular expressions to extract IP and port information. - Check the connectivity of each extracted IP-port pair. - Populate a sorted list output field with IP addresses that have no connectivity issues. - Capture and display all activity in the console log, including exceptions, successes, failures, and any other events. - Include GUI elements for usability, such as paste, copy, and reset buttons. Here’s the updated Python code corrected with intended functionality: import tkinter as tk from tkinter import ttk, scrolledtext, font import re import socket from threading import Thread from queue import Queue # Regular expression pattern to extract IP:Port pairs IP_PORT_PATTERN = r’(d+.d+.d+.d+):(d+)‘ def extract_ips(bridge_data): return re.findall(IP_PORT_PATTERN, bridge_data) def check_ip_port(queue, ip, port, timeout): try: with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock: sock.settimeout(timeout) sock.connect((ip, port)) queue.put(f\\"Connection successful for {ip}:{port}“) except socket.error as e: queue.put(f\\"Connection failed for {ip}:{port} - {e}”) def check_bridges(thread_queue, bridges, timeout, result_display, console_display): for bridge in bridges: ip, port = bridge.split(’:') thread = Thread(target=check_ip_port, args=(thread_queue, ip, int(port), timeout)) thread.start() responsive_bridges = [] while any(thread.is_alive() for thread in threading.enumerate()): while not thread_queue.empty(): response = thread_queue.get() console_display.insert(tk.END, response + “n”) if “successful” in response: responsive_bridges.append(response.split()[3]) console_display.see(tk.END) root.update() result_display.delete(‘1.0’, tk.END) for bridge in responsive_bridges: result_display.insert(tk.END, bridge + “n”) def on_check_bridges(): raw_data = bridge_input.get(‘1.0’, tk.END).strip() bridges = extract_ips(raw_data) timeout = float(timeout_entry.get()) check_bridges(thread_queue, bridges, timeout, result_display, console_display) # Create the main window root = tk.Tk() root.title(“Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker”) # Use a queue to communicate between threads thread_queue = Queue() # Input for bridges bridge_input = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(root, height=10) bridge_input.pack() # Timeout configuration timeout_label = ttk.Label(root, text=“Timeout (s):”) timeout_label.pack() timeout_entry = ttk.Entry(root) timeout_entry.insert(0, “2.0”) # Default timeout value timeout_entry.pack() # Check bridges button check_button = ttk.Button(root, text=“Check Bridges”, command=on_check_bridges) check_button.pack() # Result display result_label = ttk.Label(root, text=“Responsive Bridges:”) result_label.pack() result_display = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(root, height=10) result_display.pack() # Console display console_label = ttk.Label(root, text=“Console Log:”) console_label.pack() console_display = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(root, height=10) console_display.pack() # Start the tkinter loop root.mainloop() Please note: - The provided code now focuses on the functionality to process, check, and display a list of Tor bridges. - It may display all connection attempts in the Console Log area of the GUI. - The Sorted List area in the GUI will only display IP addresses that are accessible based on the connectivity check. - A simple Tkinter GUI is included with paste, copy, and reset functions left for implementation based on specific preferences. - Exception handling for timeouts and socket errors is managed in the check_ip_port function. Keep in mind that this code provides a foundational structure for the tool. You may need to further develop, test, and refine the code to meet all your final requirements and ensure full functionality and robustness in various scenarios. AttributeError: ‘tuple’ object has no attribute ‘split’ you also removed network interface selection, which makes things unworkabeable at all. return interface selection dropdown menu and set default interface to the last in the list available. My apologies for the oversight. It looks like the extract_ips function should return a list of strings in the format “ip:port” rather than a list of tuples, and also the network interface selection functionality was accidentally removed. Here’s the corrected and completed code with the network interface selection and defaulting to the last interface in the list: import tkinter as tk from tkinter import ttk, scrolledtext, font import re import socket import netifaces from threading import Thread from queue import Queue def extract_ips(bridge_data): pattern = re.compile(r’(d+.d+.d+.d+):(d+)‘) return [f\\"{match[0]}:{match[1]}\\" for match in pattern.findall(bridge_data)] def check_ip_port(queue, ip, port, timeout): try: with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock: sock.settimeout(timeout) sock.connect((ip, port)) queue.put(f\\"Connection successful for {ip}:{port}“) except socket.error as e: queue.put(f\\"Connection failed for {ip}:{port} - {str(e)}”) def check_bridges(): raw_data = bridge_input.get(‘1.0’, tk.END).strip() ip_port_pairs = extract_ips(raw_data) timeout = float(timeout_entry.get()) threads = [] for ip_port in ip_port_pairs: ip, port = ip_port.split(’:') thread = Thread(target=check_ip_port, args=(console_queue, ip, int(port), timeout)) thread.start() threads.append(thread) for thread in threads: thread.join() while not console_queue.empty(): console_display.configure(state=‘normal’) message = console_queue.get() console_display.insert(tk.END, message + “n”) console_display.yview(tk.END) console_display.configure(state=‘disabled’) def clear_and_reset(): bridge_input.delete(‘1.0’, tk.END) console_display.configure(state=‘normal’) console_display.delete(‘1.0’, tk.END) console_display.configure(state=‘disabled’) def get_network_interfaces(): return netifaces.interfaces() root = tk.Tk() root.title(“Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker”) responsive_bridges = [] console_queue = Queue() frame = ttk.Frame(root) frame.grid(sticky=(tk.W, tk.E, tk.N, tk.S)) frame.columnconfigure(0, weight=1) frame.rowconfigure(5, weight=1) interfaces = get_network_interfaces() default_interface = interfaces[-1] if interfaces else None net_interface_label = ttk.Label(frame, text=“Network Interface:”) net_interface_label.grid(column=0, row=0, sticky=tk.W) net_interface_selector = ttk.Combobox(frame, values=interfaces) net_interface_selector.grid(column=1, row=0, sticky=(tk.W, tk.E)) net_interface_selector.set(default_interface) timeout_label = ttk.Label(frame, text=“Timeout (s):”) timeout_label.grid(column=2, row=0, sticky=tk.W) timeout_entry = ttk.Entry(frame, width=7) timeout_entry.insert(0, “2”) # Default timeout in seconds timeout_entry.grid(column=3, row=0) bridge_label = ttk.Label(frame, text=“Bridges to Check:”) bridge_label.grid(column=0, row=1, sticky=tk.W) bridge_input = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(frame, height=10) bridge_input.grid(column=0, row=2, columnspan=4, sticky=(tk.W, tk.E, tk.N, tk.S), pady=(0, 5)) check_button = ttk.Button(frame, text=“Check Bridges”, command=check_bridges) check_button.grid(column=0, row=3, columnspan=4, pady=5) console_label = ttk.Label(frame, text=“Console Log:”) console_label.grid(column=0, row=4, sticky=tk.W) console_display = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(frame, height=10, state=‘disabled’) console_display.grid(column=0, row=5, columnspan=4, sticky=(tk.W, tk.E, tk.N, tk.S)) reset_button = ttk.Button(frame, text=“Reset”, command=clear_and_reset) reset_button.grid(column=0, row=6, columnspan=4, pady=5) root.mainloop() With these changes, the extract_ips function now returns a list of strings each containing “ip:port.” The network interfaces dropdown menu allows user selection of specific network interface, with the default interface selected as the last one in the list returned by netifaces.interfaces(). Additionally, the check_bridges function now processes each returned IP-port pair correctly and manages threads to check connectivity without locking up the UI. This should enable the Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker to function as intended. ok it forks somehow and shows: onnection successful for 168.119.54.228:443 Connection successful for 185.177.207.204:11204 Connection successful for 45.130.22.85:9992 Connection successful for 91.223.231.122:443 Connection successful for 80.67.172.3:443 Connection successful for 93.95.228.122:8443 Connection successful for 45.79.213.75:58679 Connection successful for 74.208.23.139:8443 Connection successful for 198.71.49.67:444 Connection failed for 207.180.235.104:7998 - [Errno 111] Connection refused Connection failed for 65.108.240.212:9060 - [Errno 111] Connection refused Connection failed for 172.245.136.217:443 - [Errno 111] Connection refused Connection failed for 195.15.243.226:10493 - timed out Connection failed for 140.83.61.100:7001 - timed out Connection failed for 185.24.233.136:443 - timed out Connection failed for 59.167.185.220:4430 - timed out Connection failed for 46.5.226.114:36351 - timed out Connection failed for 68.82.85.63:443 - timed out Connection failed for 94.244.77.84:14251 - timed out Connection failed for 81.169.158.131:9001 - timed out Connection failed for 104.189.146.210:45322 - timed out Connection failed for 109.192.200.111:80 - timed out Connection failed for 159.100.247.39:443 - timed out Connection failed for 213.159.80.6:46065 - timed out Connection failed for 37.247.48.90:443 - timed out Connection failed for 103.16.181.240:4548 - timed out inside a console log text area Great to hear that the code is working and outputting the connectivity results to the console log text area. The output you’re seeing is a list of successful connections to certain Tor bridge servers (with the message “Connection successful”), as well as failed connection attempts due to either the connection being refused or a timeout occurring. If you wish to have a sorted list of responsive bridges without connectivity issues, you would need to collate the successful connections separately. You could modify the code further to capture successful connections in a list and display them in a dedicated “Responsive Bridges” text area within the GUI. Here is how you could implement this additional functionality: # … (other code remains unchanged) def check_bridges(): raw_data = bridge_input.get(‘1.0’, tk.END).strip() ip_port_pairs = extract_ips(raw_data) timeout = float(timeout_entry.get()) threads = [] responsive_bridges.clear() # Clear the list before starting new checks result_display.configure(state=‘normal’) # Enable writing to the result_display result_display.delete(‘1.0’, tk.END) # Clear any previous results result_display.configure(state=‘disabled’) for ip_port in ip_port_pairs: ip, port = ip_port.split(‘:’) thread = Thread(target=check_ip_port, args=(console_queue, ip, int(port), timeout)) thread.start() threads.append(thread) for thread in threads: thread.join() while not console_queue.empty(): console_display.configure(state=‘normal’) message = console_queue.get() if “successful” in message: responsive_bridges.append(message.split(\\" \\")[3]) console_display.insert(tk.END, message + “n”) console_display.yview(tk.END) console_display.configure(state=‘disabled’) # Update the result display with responsive bridges result_display.configure(state=‘normal’) for bridge in responsive_bridges: result_display.insert(tk.END, bridge + “n”) result_display.configure(state=‘disabled’) # … (other code remains unchanged) # Initialize the list to store responsive bridges responsive_bridges = [] # … (rest of the code) root.mainloop() This modification keeps track of the responsive bridges in the responsive_bridges list, and after the threads have finished checking the connections, updates the result display with the responsive bridges. The result_display is a text area widget (like the console log) that you would add to your GUI where these responsive IP:Port pairs will be shown. You can position the result_display ScrolledText widget accordingly in your GUI, with a label indicating that this is where the responsive bridges will be displayed.

The idea behind DST is to make better use of daylight in the evenings and to conserve energy. When clocks are set forward in the spring, there's more daylight in the evening hours and less in the morning. When they are set back in the fall, the reverse is true. The concept was first proposed by Benjamin Franklin in 1784 in a satirical essay to encourage the use of natural sunlight to reduce the need for candle wax, but it wasn't seriously considered until World War I. The practice became more widespread during the 20th century, largely to save on energy costs by reducing the need for electric lighting in the evening hours. The start and end dates of Daylight Saving Time can vary by country. In many countries, including those in North America and Europe, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. However, not all countries observe DST, and even within countries, there may be regions or territories that choose not to change their clocks. DST is not without controversy, with debates around its actual energy-saving benefits, its impact on physical and mental health, and the inconvenience caused by changing clocks twice a year. Some regions have moved to stop the practice and maintain either permanent daylight saving or standard time throughout the year."},{"instruction":"What is the bad and good about that?","output":"Daylight Saving Time (DST) has both proponents and critics, and various good and bad points have been highlighted over the years: The Good: 1. **Extended Evening Daylight**: By moving an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening, DST creates more usable daylight hours after work and school, which can be beneficial for retail businesses, outdoor activities, and sports. 2. **Energy Conservation**: Originally, one of the main goals of DST was to reduce the use of artificial lighting in the evening, thereby conserving energy. However, the actual energy savings are subject to debate as lifestyles and energy usage patterns have changed. 3. **Economic Boost**: Some industries, such as tourism and retail, benefit from the additional hour of evening daylight, which can encourage people to go out and spend more money. 4. **Traffic Safety**: Some studies have suggested that DST can lead to fewer traffic accidents, as it provides more daylight during heavy commuting hours. The Bad: 1. **Health Issues**: The change to and from DST can disrupt people's circadian rhythms, leading to sleep deprivation and potential health issues, such as increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and workplace accidents right after the time change. 2. **Inconvenience**: Adjusting clocks twice a year can be inconvenient and confusing, leading to missed appointments and disrupted schedules. This is particularly an issue in the age of global communication where time zone coordination is essential. 3. **Decreased Productivity**: The transition into DST can result in a short-term decrease in productivity known as the “Monday effect\\" or \\"cyberloafing,\\" where employees spend time changing clocks and adjusting to the time change rather than working. 4. **Limited Energy Savings**: Some research indicates that any energy savings are negligible or even negative when factoring in increased use of heating and air conditioning. Modern energy consumption patterns are more complex and don't necessarily align with the rationale used when DST was first implemented. 5. **Effects on Agriculture and Livestock**: DST can disrupt the farming industry as animals don't adjust to the time change, and farming schedules are traditionally tied to the sun rather than the clock. While some regions and countries continue to observe DST, others have abolished it due to the controversies and debates about its effectiveness and impact on society. Whether or not DST is beneficial seems to depend on the specific circumstances and preferences of a given country or region."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(Polcompball Wiki)","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, \\"Tokayevism\\" is not a term that has a widely recognized definition in political science or the study of ideologies. It is possible that \\"Tokayevism\\" could refer to the political philosophy or leadership style of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who has served as the President of Kazakhstan since March 2019, following the resignation of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country's first president since the fall of the Soviet Union. In such a context, \\"Tokayevism\\" would likely describe the policies and political approaches that Tokayev has pursued during his presidency.

And what differentiates a prime minister and a president?","output":"The main difference between a parliament and a congress lies in their structure and functioning. In a parliament system, such as those in the United Kingdom or India, the legislative and executive branches are interconnected. The parliament is the supreme legislative body that is responsible for making laws, while the executive branch is headed by a prime minister, who is the leader of the political party or coalition that has the majority in parliament. The prime minister is also a member of parliament and is chosen by its members. On the other hand, in a congressional system like that of the United States or Brazil, the legislative and executive branches are more distinct and separate. The Congress is the legislative body, responsible for making laws, while the executive branch is headed by a president who is elected independently from the legislature. The president is not a member of the Congress and is elected by the citizens of the country. In terms of the role and powers, a prime minister and a president also differ. A prime minister, being the head of the executive branch, is responsible for implementing laws, managing the day-to-day affairs of the country, and representing the government both domestically and internationally. They often have greater accountability to the parliament and can be removed from office if they lose support from parliament. A president, in the congressional system, is the head of state and the head of government. They have the power to enforce laws, manage the affairs of the country, make executive decisions, and represent the country domestically and internationally. Presidents generally have a fixed term and cannot be easily removed by the legislature unless they commit serious misconduct or impeachable offenses. Overall, the main differences between a parliament system and a congressional system lie in the intertwining or separation of legislative and executive branches, and the roles and powers of prime ministers versus presidents."},{"instruction":"While the United States is not a direct democracy like Ancient Athens and is a constitutional republic, why is it common for some to insist that America is \\"not a democracy, it is a republic\\", or even \\"never been a democracy or had democratic values\\", even though, while both are different, function similarly?","output":"The distinction between a democracy and a republic is often a matter of semantics and interpretation. In a broad sense, both terms refer to systems of government where power is ultimately derived from the people. However, they have different connotations and historical contexts. A democracy, in its purest form, is a system where all eligible citizens directly participate in decision-making and governance. Ancient Athens is often cited as an example of direct democracy, where citizens gathered in assemblies to debate and vote on laws. In modern times, direct democracy is impractical for large nations, so representative democracy has become the norm. In a representative democracy, citizens elect representatives who make decisions on their behalf. A republic, on the other hand, is a system where the country is considered a \\"public matter\\" and not the private property of a monarch or ruling elite. It emphasizes the rule of law, a constitution, and the separation of powers. In a republic, the power is vested in elected representatives who act on behalf of the citizens. In the case of the United States, it is often referred to as a \\"constitutional republic\\" because it combines elements of both democracy and republicanism. The U.S. has a representative democracy, where citizens elect representatives to Congress and the President. At the same time, it is a republic because it operates under a constitution that outlines the structure of government, protects individual rights, and establishes a system of checks and balances. The insistence on referring to the United States as a republic rather than a democracy may stem from a desire to emphasize the importance of the rule of law, the separation of powers, and the protection of individual rights. Some argue that the term \\"democracy\\" is often used loosely and can be associated with the potential for mob rule or the tyranny of the majority. By emphasizing the republic aspect, they aim to highlight the importance of institutions and processes that safeguard against such risks. However, it is essential to recognize that the terms \\"democracy\\" and \\"republic\\" are not mutually exclusive, and the United States can be considered both a democracy and a republic. The country's system of government combines democratic principles with republican values, and the terms are often used interchangeably in common usage."},{"instruction":"Why do most countries that have official names with \\"Democratic Republic\\" usually aren't? Such as North Korea or the Democratic Republic of the Congo?","output":"The use of terms like \\"Democratic Republic\\" in the official names of countries does not necessarily reflect the actual nature of their governance. In many cases, such names are chosen for political or ideological reasons, rather than accurately representing the democratic nature of the country. In the examples you mentioned, North Korea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the use of \\"Democratic Republic\\" in their official names can be seen as a form of propaganda or an attempt to legitimize their rule. However, the reality is often quite different. North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is an authoritarian regime with a highly centralized government. Power is concentrated in the hands of the ruling Kim family, and the country lacks the basic elements of democracy, such as free and fair elections, political pluralism, and respect for human rights. Similarly, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has faced significant challenges in achieving a functioning democracy since gaining independence. While the country has made some progress towards democratic governance, it has also experienced periods of political instability, armed conflict, and human rights abuses. The DRC has struggled with corruption, weak institutions, and limited respect for the rule of law, which hinder the establishment of a robust democratic system. In both cases, the inclusion of \\"Democratic Republic\\" in their official names can be seen as an attempt to present a positive image to the international community or to create a perception of legitimacy. However, the reality on the ground often contradicts these claims. It is important to critically analyze the actual practices and institutions of a country rather than relying solely on its official name or rhetoric to assess its democratic nature. True democracy requires not just the use of democratic terminology but also the presence of democratic principles, such as respect for human rights, political freedoms, and meaningful citizen participation in decision-making processes."},{"instruction":"What is Tokayevism (according to Polcompball Wiki)?","output":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, the term \\"Tokayevism\\" does not have a widely recognized or established definition in political science or among political ideologies.

They are the largest indigenous group in the region and are known for their distinct cultural practices, language, and adaptation to the cold climate of Siberia. The Yakut language belongs to the Siberian branch of the Turkic languages and is closely related to other Turkic languages spoken in Central Asia. The language is used in official and cultural contexts within Yakutia, though Russian is also widely spoken given that it is the official state language of Russia. Traditionally, the Yakut economy has been based on horse and cattle breeding, which has been adapted to the extreme subarctic climate. They are also skilled hunters and fishermen. Due to the harsh climate, the Yakuts developed specific architectural methods for their homes, clothing suitable for the cold, and a cuisine that relies heavily on meat and dairy products. The Yakuts practiced shamanism, like many indigenous Siberian tribes, but with the arrival of Russian explorers and settlers, many were converted to Russian Orthodoxy starting from the 17th century onward. Despite this, aspects of their traditional shamanistic practices have been preserved and have seen a cultural revival in recent years. Yakutia is known for its rich natural resources, including diamonds, gold, and other minerals. The rise of extractive industries in the region has brought economic changes and challenges to the traditional Yakut way of life. As of the early 2020s, the Yakut population is around one million, with the majority living in the Sakha Republic. They continue to play a significant role in the cultural and political life of the region."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

Email #1, from Eric Moore: From: MacKinnon & Phillips Law Firm 12226 Cobblestone Dr, Houston, TX Good day Sir/Madam 20-12-2023 I am writing to inform you that i saw your file and documents of your Abandoned consignment at the Justice Department office on Monday this week when i went to defends my client, and i was just going through my unread mails this morning and i just decided to give your own case a special attention because of the sensitive nature of the issue at hands and considering the threat from government authorities to confiscate your funds since you are not coming to claim your funds. I want you to note here that it is not about offering your former and present partners handling your funds delivery 10% of the Funds or looking for whom to bring your funds to you, it is all about doing what the law said concerning CASH delivery funds that is above Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars? The most important thing that you should know concerning your Cash Delivery payment is that you started it in a wrong move without imploring the services of a lawyer who knows the law concerning cash delivery payment and that is why you wasted all the money you spent without receiving a cent from the said funds. I was at the Justice Department office for a similar issue of my client when I saw your file and documents at the Cash Clearance Department of the Justice Department and that is why I contacted you and I can help you get your funds if you are serious and ready to receive your funds. There is not much work on your funds release because as a legal luminary, I know the first step to take for them to release your funds to you. The first step to release your funds to you is for me to take your information and your I'D and swear AFFIDAVITS OF CLAIM that you are incapacitated as a result of Covid-19 or ONE Ailment which made you not to have money for further payment of any kind and should issue you \\"A WAIVER\\" that will warrant you to receive your funds first and pay in return from the funds. To get this Affidavits and Waiver will cost us at least 850 because swearing of Affidavits will cost 350 while the WAIVER will cost 500, So the two applications will cost us at least 850 and this is the only money we have to pay and you will receive your funds at your bank address within two working days without much stress. As it stands now, I would like to assist you to pay 500 while you pay 350 and you will not spend extra money until I bring your funds to your home address. If you are serious about receiving your funds, kindly indicate to me when you will be ready to send the money so that my Law Firm will start working on your file by Monday. This is the only thing you need to do and receive your funds.

Your comforting reassurance and expertise as a legal luminary from MacKinnon & Phillips Law Firm provides me with a beacon of hope. The fact that you’ve generously offered to contribute 500 towards the affidavits and waiver fees is nothing short of magnanimous. This gesture of goodwill certainly cements my trust in your intentions and professional integrity. I am more than eager to proceed with the necessary steps and fully abide by your instructions. The thought that this ordeal could be resolved within just two working days and with minimal financial input on my side is a relief. As per your request, I am ready to make the payment of 350 for the completion of the affidavits and waiver without any delay. However, before we proceed any further, I require a little guidance on how to securely transfer this amount, as well as some authentic details to ensure the transaction’s utmost confidentiality and legitimacy. Would you be so kind as to provide the following, so that we can swiftly move forward with the resolution? 1. A scanned copy of your legal practitioner’s license or bar association identification, to verify your esteemed position within the MacKinnon & Phillips Law Firm. 2. A detailed statement on official letterhead that outlines the steps we need to take, signed and stamped by you, for my personal records. 3. The precise payment instructions, including the preferred method of payment to ensure it is most expediently applied towards the necessary legal paperwork. I am also slightly encumbered with a scheduling conflict as I am presently recovering from a minor ailment. As such, might I inquire if there’s any paperwork I could begin filling out electronically or other preparatory measures to expedite the process? My eagerness to resolve this cannot be understated and I wish to contribute maximum efficiency from my end.

They are one of the largest indigenous groups in Siberia and are traditionally nomadic reindeer herders, hunters, and gatherers, although many have settled into sedentary lifestyles in recent times. The Evenks speak the Evenki language, which is part of the Northern Tungusic branch of the Tungusic languages, under the wider Altaic language family. Their traditional religion is shamanism, which involves a belief in spirits of nature and the importance of shamans as intermediaries between the human world and the spirit world. Throughout their history, Evenks have interacted with various other ethnic groups and empires, including the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union, which affected their cultural and social structure. Soviet collectivization policies, for example, had a significant impact on their traditional nomadic lifestyle, while efforts to assimilate indigenous groups into Soviet society led to changes in their language use and cultural practices. Today, Evenks continue to face challenges related to cultural preservation and rights to their ancestral lands and natural resources. Their population is distributed across a vast territory, but they maintain their cultural heritage through language, traditional crafts, rituals, and a strong connection to their environment and way of life."},{"instruction":"what type of source is the following: Gupta, A., & Toosi, A.

These types of reports are typically considered grey literature, which includes materials and research produced by organizations outside of the traditional commercial or academic publishing and distribution channels. Organizational reports often detail research, findings, or recommendations from the organization on a particular issue—in this case, the environmental impact of the internet and the efforts to create a greener digital space. Keep in mind that while such reports can provide valuable insights and data, they may also reflect the objectives and advocacy stances of the organization that publishes them. Hence, when cited in research or used in assessments, the organization's perspective should be taken into account alongside peer-reviewed academic sources for a comprehensive understanding of the topic."},{"instruction":"where was this published","output":"The source \\"Clicking Clean: Who Is Winning the Race to Build a Green Internet?\\" is a report by Greenpeace. Greenpeace is known for publishing its reports and research findings primarily on its own platforms, such as its official website. Therefore, it is most likely that this report was published on the Greenpeace website or possibly in print form as part of their campaign materials. Reports of this nature do not typically have a \\"location\\" in the same way that books have a place of publication (e.g., a city where the publisher is located), since they are not commercial publications. If you need to reference the location in a citation and are referring to the electronic version, you might simply use the URL where the report can be accessed. If you actually have a physical copy, then you might cite the headquarters of Greenpeace as the publication location, if such information is provided in the report. For the most accurate information on where the report was published, you should look at the report itself or visit the Greenpeace website for details."},{"instruction":"with depth and higher understanding in finding vulnerability in smart contrast analysis this contract line by line with depth and focus on every possible line that contain the vulnerability or bug that can be danger to the contract process all that you can find it with understand all the functions how they work together so as result provide an exhaustive list off all issues and vulnerabilities inside the following smart contract.

} } }","output":"Given that the provided code is extensive and that I don't have the capacity to perform a full interactive audit, I will outline a generic approach to analyzing smart contracts for vulnerabilities and then provide a simulated example of how one might fill out the requested Markdown table. When auditing a smart contract, one should analyze both its individual functions and the interplay between them, considering possible attacks from both external and internal actors. A thorough audit process would include, but is not limited to, checking for: - Reentrancy attacks - Arithmetic overflows and underflows - The proper use of safe math libraries (if necessary) - Access control issues (malicious or unauthorized use of permissions) - Handling of external calls and possible failures - Checks-effects-interactions pattern - Front-running vulnerabilities - Proper validation of input data - Denial-of-service attack vectors - Logical errors leading to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior - Gas optimization opportunities - Adherence to the principle of least privilege For example, auditing the function \`storePrice()\` might involve checking for reentrancy attacks (since it modifies state and could potentially interact with external contracts). To write this in the requested Markdown table format, one might use the following template (Please note, the following table is hypothetical and does not reflect actual vulnerabilities in the provided code): \`\`\`markdown | Description | Action | Severity | Actors | Scenario | Type | Line | |---------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------|--------| | Reentrancy in \`storePrice()\` | Utilize \`nonReentrant\` modifier or checks-effects-interactions pattern | high + 🔥 | Attacker, Contract | An attacker uses the state change in \`storePrice()\` to call back into the contract and manipulate the stored price. | vulnerability | [storePrice] | | Division by zero in \`_getCurrentPrice()\` | Ensure base price is not zero before division | medium | User | When getting the price of an asset in terms of another, if the base asset price is zero, it will cause a revert or faulty calculation. | vulnerability | [_getCurrentPrice()] | \`\`\` To generate a report with actual issues from the code provided, one would need tools and expertise in smart contract auditing. stringWithout delving into static and dynamic analysis of the contract's functions and possible interactions, it's not feasible to provide a truthful and reliable analysis of vulnerabilities in this setting. For a real-world scenario, this work should be assigned to professional auditors, who would likely use a combination of manual review and automated tools to perform a comprehensive assessment of the contract's safety and propose necessary changes or fixes."},{"instruction":"I THINK NOT valid review agin and give the correct vulenrbaility and prove it('s correct with evidence from link","output":"As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I'm constrained by the format in which I provide output. I can’t execute or dynamically test the Solidity code you’ve posted, nor do I have the ability to access external content such as links, tools, or resources that may provide additional insights or evidence for vulnerabilities after my last training data in September 2021. However, I’ll attempt to provide a higher-level review of the contract code posted and identify sections that generally tend to be more vulnerable to exploits, based on patterns known at the time of my last update. It's very important to note that a thorough review should include static analysis, dynamic analysis, and manual review by an experienced auditor. Key aspects to look at may include: 1. **Reentrancy**: The \`storePrice()\` function could potentially be susceptible to reentrancy attacks if \`_getCurrentPrice()\` interacts with untrusted contracts (depending on what \`_getSubmoduleIfInstalled()\` and the relevant Strategy contracts do). It’s essential that each external call is considered for reentrancy risks. 2. **Access Control**: The functions marked with \`permissioned\` ensure that only authorized addresses can call them, however, it’s crucial to review the Module or Kernel contract that \`permissioned\` is based on to ensure correct implementation. 3. **Arithmetic Overflows/Underflows**: With Solidity 0.8.x, the compiler includes built-in overflow/underflow checks which is positive in terms of contract safety. 4. **Front-Running**: The function \`storePrice()\` writes the new price to storage. If there's a way for an attacker to front-run this function with a transaction that benefits from the previous price, it could be exploited. 5. **Price Oracle Manipulation**: If the price feeds themselves are not secure or can be manipulated, then it can cause a cascade of issues throughout the contract. 6. **Correctness**: The functions that use price data (e.g. \`_getCurrentPrice()\`) must be robust against incorrect or manipulated inputs from oracles. Without the ability to interact with external sources or tools, the above points are speculative and based on experience with common Smart Contract patterns of vulnerability. Each smart contract, its context, and integrations are unique; therefore, identifying vulnerabilities requires a detailed and hands-on assessment. For evidence and best practices on finding and proving vulnerabilities, one would typically refer to recognized security companies publications or databases like the NCC Group, Trail of Bits, or known vulnerability databases such as the SWC registry. Lastly, for the requested Markdown report with actual identified issues and line numbers, it would be best if you rely on expert auditors and real-world testing using up-to-date tools and methods. The vulnerabilities and their severity would depend on the contract's specifics, as well as the context in which it's being used."},{"instruction":"I THINK NOT valid review agin and give the correct vulenrbaility and prove it('s correct with evidence from link there is just one valid vulenrbaility that is exist and can be proving that is correct find it in the contract and give the vulenrbale part","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI with a knowledge cutoff in early 2023, I do not have the capability to prove or disprove the correctness of a vulnerability with external evidence, given I cannot access external links or run dynamic code analysis. However, analyzing the given code, there is a potential issue within the \`_getCurrentPrice\` function: \`\`\`solidity if (prices.length == 1) { if (prices[0] == 0) revert PRICE_PriceZero(asset_); return (prices[0], uint48(block.timestamp)); } else { // Get price from strategy Component memory strategy = abi.decode(asset.strategy, (Component)); (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(_getSubmoduleIfInstalled(strategy.target)) .staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(strategy.selector, prices, strategy.params)); // Ensure call was successful if (!success) revert PRICE_StrategyFailed(asset_, data); // Decode asset price uint256 price = abi.decode(data, (uint256)); // Ensure value is not zero if (price == 0) revert PRICE_PriceZero(asset_); return (price, uint48(block.timestamp)); } \`\`\` This section contains an optimistic return of the \`block.timestamp\`, which is considered unsafe in some contexts since \`block.timestamp\` can be slightly manipulated by miners. A miner could potentially manipulate the timestamp to influence the price returned, which could be a vulnerability depending on the economic incentives involved. However, whether this is a true vulnerability would greatly depend on the specific use case of the contract and the economic implications of such an optimistic timestamp return. In some cases, it could be completely benign, but in others, particularly where precise timing matters for pricing or other time-sensitive operations, it could be a risk. It is important to understand that identifying an objective \\"correct vulnerability\\" is not always straightforward. An issue that is critical in one context might be acceptable in another, depending on the specific logic and purpose of the contract. Therefore, the final assessment should always be conducted by a professional security auditor with a full understanding of the contract's environment and intended use. Here's a hypothetical example of the issue formatted as a markdown table: \`\`\`markdown | Description | Action | Severity | Actors | Scenario | Type | Line | |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------| | Optimistic return of block.timestamp leading to potential time manipulation | Ensure the integrity of timestamps used for price calculations | medium | Miners | A miner publishes a block with a manipulated timestamp within the allowable drift to benefit from price movements | vulnerability | _getCurrentPrice | \`\`\` Auditors would also typically consider the overall system design, dependencies, and how contracts interact with each other. Vulnerability evidence would be obtained via tests, proofs, or historical exploits noted in resources such as the CVE database, Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices, or audit reports by prominent security firms."},{"instruction":"incoorect","output":"Apologies for my previous analyses. It appears I might have missed identifying the specific vulnerability within your smart contract code. Without the ability to execute the contract or interact with the blockchain, I must rely on static analysis to assess potential vulnerabilities. Looking over the code again with a focus on static analysis and common smart contract vulnerabilities, one section that may need further inspection is related to the division in the \`getPriceIn\` function where the asset price is divided by the base price: \`\`\`solidity /// @inheritdoc PRICEv2 /// @dev Optimistically uses the cached price if it has been updated this block, otherwise calculates price dynamically function getPriceIn(address asset_, address base_) external view override returns (uint256) { // Get the last price of each asset (getPrice checks if asset is approved) (uint256 assetPrice, uint48 assetTime) = getPrice(asset_, Variant.LAST); (uint256 basePrice, uint48 baseTime) = getPrice(base_, Variant.LAST); // Try to use the last prices, timestamp must be current // If stale, get current price if (assetTime != uint48(block.timestamp)) { (assetPrice, ) = _getCurrentPrice(asset_); } if (baseTime != uint48(block.timestamp)) { (basePrice, ) = _getCurrentPrice(base_); } // Calculate the price of the asset in the base and return return (assetPrice * 10 ** decimals) / basePrice; } \`\`\` This code assumes that \`basePrice\` is not zero. In Solidity, division by zero triggers a revert, terminating the transaction. Therefore, proper checks should be conducted to ensure that \`basePrice\` will never be zero before this division is performed. However, according to the code, there is a revert condition inside \`_getCurrentPrice()\` which is supposed to handle the case where the price is zero: \`\`\`solidity if (price == 0) revert PRICE_PriceZero(asset_); \`\`\` Given this, if the checks hold up as written, there shouldn’t be a division by zero issue. However, there could be a scenario where \`getPriceIn()\` is called and \`basePrice\` is somehow returned as zero because of an incorrect update or misconfiguration, leading to a potential vulnerability. It's worth noting that without further context, or additional code (like the \`Module\` contract, Strategies, or Feeds), identifying a singular exact vulnerability with certainty is challenging. Identifying vulnerabilities in smart contracts typically requires context and an understanding of how different parts of the system interact. For a full and accurate audit, it is necessary that each method, its interaction with other internal and external methods (from other contracts), and the state changes it causes, be thoroughly checked by a security expert or auditing firm, with the assistance of automated analysis tools where appropriate. If you have a specific vulnerability in mind or wish to discuss a known issue found in an audit, please provide more focused details."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: Dear Sir/Madam Am interested in business project that needs to be funding either as loan or Joint Venture,Kindly get back to me if you have any.you can contact my foreign investment adviser directly for further discussions through my email address: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Regards <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>","output":"Dear Mr. Hamad, Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your business project.

Video Ad Feedback See CNN' visit to the nuclear fusion lab trying to replicate the Sun on Earth (May, 2023) 02:24 - Source: CNN CNN — Scientists in California shooting nearly 200 lasers at a cylinder holding a fuel capsule the size of a peppercorn have taken another step in the quest for fusion energy, which, if mastered, could provide the world with a near-limitless source of clean power. Last year on a December morning, scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California (LLNL) managed, in a world first, to produce a nuclear fusion reaction that released more energy than it used, in a process called “ignition.” Now they say they have successfully replicated ignition at least three times this year, according to a December report from the LLNL. This marks another significant step in what could one day be an important solution to the global climate crisis, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. NIF's target chamber is where the magic happens -- temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures extreme enough to compress the target to densities up to 100 times the density of lead are created there. Damien Jemison/LLNL For decades, scientists have attempted to harness fusion energy, essentially recreating the power of the sun on Earth. After making their historic net energy gain last year, the next important step was to prove the process could be replicated. Brian Appelbe, a research fellow from the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said the ability to replicate demonstrates the “robustness” of the process, showing it can be achieved even when conditions such as the laser or fuel pellet are varied. Each experiment also offers an opportunity to study the physics of ignition in detail, Appelbe told CNN. “This provides valuable information to the scientists in addressing the next challenge to be overcome: how to maximize the energy that can be obtained.” Unlike nuclear fission — the process used in the world’s nuclear plants today, which is generated by the division of atoms — nuclear fusion leaves no legacy of long-lived radioactive waste. As the climate crisis accelerates, and the urgency of ditching planet-heating fossil fuels increases, the prospect of an abundant source of safe, clean energy is tantalizing. Nuclear fusion, the reaction that powers the sun and other stars, involves smashing two or more atoms together to form a denser one, in a process that releases huge amounts of energy. NIF's target chamber is where the magic happens -- temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures extreme enough to compress the target to densities up to 100 times the density of lead are created there. Damien Jemison/LLNL US scientists reach long-awaited nuclear fusion breakthrough, source says There are different ways of creating energy from fusion, but at NIF, scientists fire an array of nearly 200 lasers at a pellet of hydrogen fuel inside a diamond capsule the size of a peppercorn, itself inside a gold cylinder. The lasers heat up the cylinder’s outside, creating a series of very fast explosions, generating large amounts of energy collected as heat. The energy produced in December 2022 was small — it took around 2 megajoules to power the reaction, which released a total of 3.15 megajoules, enough to boil around 10 kettles of water. But it was sufficient to make it a successful ignition and to prove that laser fusion could create energy. Since then, the scientists have done it several more times. On July 30, the NIF laser delivered a little over 2 megajoules to the target, which resulted in 3.88 megajoules of energy — their highest yield achieved to date, according to the report. Two subsequent experiments in October also delivered net gains. “These results demonstrated NIF’s ability to consistently produce fusion energy at multi-megajoule levels,” the report said. There is still a very long way to go, however, until nuclear fusion reaches the scale needed to power electric grids and heating systems. The focus now is on building on the progress made and figuring out how to dramatically scale up fusion projects and significantly bring down costs. At the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, US climate envoy John Kerry launched an international engagement plan involving more than 30 countries with the aim of boosting nuclear fusion to help tackle the climate crisis. “There is potential in fusion to revolutionize our world, and to change all of the options that are in front of us, and provide the world with abundant and clean energy without the harmful emissions of traditional energy sources,” Kerry told the climate gathering. In December, the US Department of Energy announced a 42 million investment in a program bringing together multiple institutions, including LLNL, to establish “hubs” focused on advancing fusion. “Harnessing fusion energy is one of the greatest scientific and technological challenges of the 21st Century,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in a statement. “We now have the confidence that it’s not only possible, but probable, that fusion energy can be a reality.” Ella Nilsen and René Marsh contributed to reporting Related Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Search Log In My Account Settings Topics You Follow Log Out Your CNN account Log in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics The Biden Presidency Facts First 2024 Elections Business Markets Tech Media Calculators Videos Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa 2 Degrees CNN Heroes All Features Weather Climate Wildfire Tracker Video More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN World Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Log In My Account Settings Topics You Follow Log Out Your CNN account Log in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2023 Cable News Network.

Давление - это сила, действующая на единицу площади стенки сосуда, обусловленная столкновениями частиц газа. Температура связана со средней кинетической энергией частиц. Термодинамическое равновесие - это состояние системы, в котором макроскопические величины остаются постоянными. Основное уравнение для идеального газа, данное молекулярно-кинетической теорией (МКТ), выглядит так: PV = (1/3)Nm<v^2>, где P - давление, V - объём, N - количество частиц, m - масса одной частицы, <v^2> - среднеквадратичное значение скорости частиц. 2. **Закон Бойля-Мариотта для изотермического процесса. Графики.** Закон Бойля-Мариотта определяет, что для заданной массы идеального газа при постоянной температуре (изотермический процесс) произведение его давления на объём является постоянным: P1V1 = P2V2. Это устанавливает обратнопропорциональную зависимость между давлением и объёмом. График этого закона в координатах P-V представляет собой гиперболу. 3. **Закон Гей-Люссака для изобарного процесса. Графики.** Закон Гей-Люссака устанавливает, что при постоянном давлении объём идеального газа прямо пропорционален его температуре: V1/T1 = V2/T2, где T - температура в кельвинах. Графиком этой зависимости в координатах V-T является прямая линия, исходящая из начала координат. 4. **Закон Шарля для изохорного процесса. Графики.** Закон Шарля гласит, что при постоянном объёме давление идеального газа прямо пропорционально его температуре: P1/T1 = P2/T2. График этого процесса в координатах P-T также является прямой линией, выходящей из начала координат. 5. **Закон Дальтона, закон Авогадро, уравнение Клапейрона, уравнение состояния идеального газа (уравнение Менделеева-Клапейрона).** Закон Дальтона утверждает, что общее давление смеси нескольких газов равно сумме парциальных давлений каждого газа в смеси. Закон Авогадро говорит, что при одинаковом давлении и температуре, равные объёмы разных газов содержат одинаковое количество молекул. Уравнение Клапейрона для идеального газа имеет вид PV = nRT, где P - давление, V - объем, n - количество молей газа, R - универсальная газовая постоянная, и T - температура в кельвинах. Уравнение Менделеева-Клапейрона считается универсальным уравнением состояния для идеального газа: PV = (m/M)RT, где m - масса газа, а M - молекулярная масса газа. 6. **Электрическое поле, электростатическое поле, заряд, дискретность электрического заряда, закон сохранения электрического заряда, закон Кулона.** Электрическое поле - это область вокруг электрически заряженного объекта, в которой другие заряженные объекты испытывают силу. Электростатическое поле - это электрическое поле вокруг неподвижного заряда. Дискретность заряда означает, что заряд всегда кратен элементарному заряду e. Закон сохранения заряда гласит, что общий электрический заряд изолированной системы сохраняется. Закон Кулона гласит, что сила F между двумя зарядами пропорциональна произведению их зарядов q1 и q2 и обратно пропорциональна квадрату расстояния между ними r: F = k * q1 * q2 / r^2, где k - электростатическая постоянная. 7. **Потенциал, эквипотенциальные поверхности, потенциал поля точечного заряда, связь напряженности и потенциала.** Электрический потенциал (V) в точке поля определяется как работа, совершаемая для перемещения единичного положительного заряда из бесконечности в данную точку. Эквипотенциальные поверхности - это поверхности равного потенциала, где работа по перемещению заряда отсутствует. Потенциал поля точечного заряда на расстоянии r от заряда q определяется формулой V = k * q / r. Напряженность электрического поля (E) и потенциал связаны таким образом, что E = -dV/dr, где dV/dr - градиент потенциала (его производная по расстоянию). 8. **Проводники в электрическом поле.** В проводниках есть свободные электроны, которые могут свободно перемещаться по всему объему проводника. Когда проводник помещается в электрическое поле, свободные заряды внутри него перераспределяются так, чтобы поле внутри проводника стало равным нулю. Поверхность проводника становится эквипотенциальной, и весь избыточный заряд распределяется по его поверхности. 9. **Диэлектрики в электрическом поле. Типы диэлектриков. Поляризация диэлектриков. Сегнетоэлектрики.** Диэлектрики - это материалы, которые не проводят электрический ток, но могут поляризоваться в электрическом поле, то есть их положительные и отрицательные заряды могут смещаться в противоположных направлениях, создавая индуцированные диполи. Это уменьшает общую напряженность поля внутри диэлектрика. Существуют различные типы диэлектриков, включая полярные и неполярные. Сегнетоэлектрики - это специальные виды диэлектриков с высокой поляризуемостью, которые могут сохранять поляризацию после удаления внешнего поля. 10. **Электроёмкость, конденсаторы, виды конденсаторов, соединения конденсаторов.** Электроёмкость (C) - это мера способности конденсатора накапливать электрический заряд при заданной разности потенциалов. Рассчитывается по формуле C = Q/V, где Q - заряд на пластинах конденсатора, а V - разность потенциалов между ними. Существуют различные типы конденсаторов: плоские, цилиндрические, сферические и др. При соединении конденсаторов последовательно их общая ёмкость уменьшается: 1/Cобщ = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ... При параллельном соединении их ёмкости складываются: Cобщ = C1 + C2 + ... Эти ответы необходимо адаптировать к уровню подробности, который ожидается на вашем зачёте.

By initializing both to \`1e18\`, it ensures that the first time a gauge generates a profit and updates the \`gaugeProfitIndex\`, users will be able to claim their rightful share based on their gauge weight since the last claim. However, the concern you've highlighted is that initializing the indices to \`1e18\` could potentially allow users to claim profits even if there haven't been any profits generated (as \`_gaugeProfitIndex\` - \`_userGaugeProfitIndex\` would incorrectly yield \`0\`). This could lead to an undesired distribution of tokens. To address this potential issue, one would typically structure the profit distribution logic to ensure that there is actually profit available before allowing any claims. It is essential for the \`notifyPnL\` function, which is the mechanism by which profit or loss is reported for a gauge, to modify the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` only when there are profits (\`amount > 0\`). A careful examination of the \`claimGaugeRewards\` function shows that \`deltaIndex\` would be \`0\` only if \`_gaugeProfitIndex\` and \`_userGaugeProfitIndex\` are equal. Under normal circumstances, this would mean no new profits have been allocated since the user's last claim. The \`_gaugeProfitIndex\` would only increase from its initial \`1e18\` when actual profits are reported through \`notifyPnL\`. Therefore, if the system is functioning correctly and there is no manipulation or errors in the \`notifyPnL\` process, users should only be able to claim rewards after real profits have been posted to the gauge's index. What's important here is the correctness of the implementation surrounding profit reporting (\`notifyPnL\`) and the protection against erroneous or malicious updates that could make the profit indexes diverge from the actual profits. That said, it's crucial to perform thorough testing, possible audits, and careful code reviews to ensure the contract behaves correctly under all circumstances, and that scenarios like the one you've described (erroneous reward claims without genuine profit) cannot occur. If you are looking to build extra safety measures, one possible approach is to introduce a check within the \`claimGaugeRewards\` function to ensure that profit distribution via \`notifyPnL\` has occurred at least once before allowing any claims. This would involve checking whether the \`_gaugeProfitIndex\` has ever been updated from its initial state, which would require additional state markers or conditions within the system design to keep track of this information. Lastly, ensuring there's clear documentation and understanding around the initial index values and their implications for profit distribution is key for users and developers interacting with the contract."},{"instruction":"давай подробно заготовим ответы преподавателю на эти 10 вопросов заватра зачет, это физика 2 курс, что бы еще формулы были и пиши их сразу понятно без формул latex.","output":"К сожалению, вы не предоставили конкретные вопросы, на которые вы хотели бы получить подробные ответы.

Поскольку требуется подробная информация, я ограничусь первыми пятью вопросами для того, чтобы ответы были качественными и было достаточно места для их развернутого описания. Если вам нужен расширенный ответ и на другие вопросы, пожалуйста, дайте знать. 1. Основные положения МКТ и их опытные доказательства. Основные понятия МКТ. МКТ (молекулярно-кинетическая теория) основывается на следующих положениях: - Вещество состоит из частиц (молекул, атомов), которые находятся в непрерывном движении. - Частицы взаимодействуют друг с другом через столкновения и притяжение/отталкивание на коротких расстояниях. - Между частицами существуют расстояния, которые в газовой фазе гораздо больше, чем размеры самих частиц. - Энергия частиц распределена неравномерно и непрерывно изменяется из-за столкновений. Опытными доказательствами МКТ служат броуновское движение, диффузия, явление вязкости, теплопроводности и другие. Основные понятия: молекула, атом, кинетическая энергия, температура, давление. 2. Идеальный газ. Давление. Температура. Термодинамическое равновесие. Основное уравнение МКТ идеального газа. Идеальный газ — газ, частицы которого не взаимодействуют друг с другом и имеют нулевые объемы. Давление идеального газа (P) — результат столкновений частиц с поверхностями сосуда. Температура (T) — мера средней кинетической энергии частиц газа. Термодинамическое равновесие — состояние, при котором макропараметры системы остаются неизменными. Основное уравнение МКТ: P = (1/3) * m*n*<(v^2)>, где m — масса молекулы, n — концентрация молекул, <(v^2)> — средний квадрат скорости, P — давление. 3. Распределение Максвелла по скоростям молекул. Средняя арифметическая скорость. Средняя квадратичная скорость. Функция распределения Максвелла описывает вероятности того, что молекула газа будет иметь определенную скорость. Средняя арифметическая скорость (<v>) — среднее значение скоростей всех молекул. Средняя квадратичная скорость (v_rms) — корень квадратный из среднего значения квадратов скоростей всех молекул, v_rms = sqrt(3kT/m), где k — постоянная Больцмана, T — температура в кельвинах, m — масса молекулы. 4. Идеальный газ. Изопроцессы. Закон Бойля-Мариотта для изотермического процесса. Графики. Изотермический процесс происходит при постоянной температуре.

The code presents a potential scenario where the profit index for a new gauge or one that has not yet generated profits might be incorrectly initialized to \`1e18\`. The same default value is also used as a starting point for a user's profit index for that gauge. Here's what the code does in this area: \`\`\`solidity uint256 _gaugeProfitIndex = gaugeProfitIndex[gauge]; uint256 _userGaugeProfitIndex = userGaugeProfitIndex[user][gauge]; if (_gaugeProfitIndex == 0) { _gaugeProfitIndex = 1e18; } if (_userGaugeProfitIndex == 0) { _userGaugeProfitIndex = 1e18; } uint256 deltaIndex = _gaugeProfitIndex - _userGaugeProfitIndex; \`\`\` If the profit index is indeed supposed to represent \\"no profits yet,\\" then setting it to \`1e18\` could falsely imply that there's a profit when there isn't. Since both indexes (_gaugeProfitIndex and _userGaugeProfitIndex) default to \`1e18\`, the subsequent calculation of \`deltaIndex\` could result in \`0\`, which would indicate no new profits, and no credits would be erroneously rewarded. However, this approach could lead to confusion regarding whether a \`0\` \`deltaIndex\` is due to no new profits or both indexes just being at their initialized default values of \`1e18\`. This could be clarified or improved by: - Explicitly documenting this behavior in the comments to avoid confusion. - Using a specific distinct value, potentially a \`null\` equivalent, to indicate uninitialized state (though Solidity does not have \`null\`, it would have to be a special value negotiated by contract conventions). - Including checks to ensure that the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` for a gauge is only non-zero if there has actually been profit attributed to the gauge, preventing the confusion between initialization and actual profit presence. It's important to note that the default Solidity behavior for uninitialized mapping values is to return \`0\`. So, without further context on the particular business logic or system expectations for \`gaugeProfitIndex\` and \`userGaugeProfitIndex\`, it does seem like the function effectively treats the scenario of \\"no profits\\" and \\"not yet calculated/initialized profits\\" similarly by using the \`1e18\` baseline. Since this is a critical financial system component, any ambiguity or potential for undeserved reward distribution should be addressed carefully either through code changes or through very clear documentation indicating why the current system is secure against such issues. It might be beneficial for the team to include tests or simulations to ensure that the system behaves correctly and does not distribute rewards improperly before deployment."},{"instruction":"how can rewards be claimed if there has been no profit ? In all cases it's the delta between user index & gauge index that is used to disburse rewards","output":"You are correct that rewards are claimed based on the delta between the user's profit index and the gauge's profit index. Here is a quick summary of the mechanism: - The \`gaugeProfitIndex\` represents the accumulated profit per unit of gauge weight. - The \`userGaugeProfitIndex\` is a snapshot of the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` at the time the user last claimed their rewards or changed their weight. It tracks what the user has already claimed. - When claiming rewards, the contract looks at the difference (\`deltaIndex\`) between the current \`gaugeProfitIndex\` and the \`userGaugeProfitIndex\`. This delta represents the new profits that have been distributed to the gauge since the user last claimed or updated their position. If there has been no profit: - No new tokens have been added to the gauge's profits, so the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` has not increased. - When the user tries to claim rewards, the \`deltaIndex\` will be zero because there has been no change in the \`gaugeProfitIndex\`. In this case, \`creditEarned\` in the following code snippet would be zero: \`\`\`solidity uint256 deltaIndex = _gaugeProfitIndex - _userGaugeProfitIndex; if (deltaIndex != 0) { creditEarned = (_userGaugeWeight * deltaIndex) / 1e18; ... } \`\`\` However, the potential issue identified earlier is not with this mechanism itself, but rather with initializing the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` and \`userGaugeProfitIndex\` to \`1e18\` if they are zero. If the indexes are initialized to \`1e18\` for a gauge that has never had profits, or for a user who has never claimed, there would seemingly be no opportunity for the delta to be non-zero, thus preventing any incorrect rewards. The code behavior could potentially create confusion due to setting a non-zero state for indexes even when they have never changed due to actual profits. Solidity mappings return a default value of zero for uninitialized keys, so this initial bump to \`1e18\` stands out as an explicit design choice -- likely ensuring that brand new gauges or users with a fresh voting weight are not wrongly assumed to have already claimed past profits that never existed for them. It's a mechanism to establish the baseline at the inception of user interaction with the gauge. The important safeguard is that despite these indexes starting at \`1e18\`, profits can only be claimed if the gauge's profit index has actually increased due to real profits being added, which would only happen if the contract receives funds as part of the \`notifyPnL\` function's profit notification logic. Assuming the rest of the contract logic properly manages the profit distribution and updates the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` only when real profits are received, there shouldn't be a scenario where users can claim rewards that don't exist. Nonetheless, the original question is correct in pointing out that modeling and documentation clarity is critical to ensure that the implementation matches the expected behavior and that there are no edge cases where users might claim rewards when none should be available."},{"instruction":"so now what is the vulnerability with simple explaining base on how can rewards be claimed if there has been no profit ? In all cases it's the delta between user index & gauge index that is used to disburse rewards","output":"Based on the code provided and the described mechanism of using a delta between the user index and the gauge index to distribute rewards, there doesn't seem to be a clear vulnerability directly related to the distribution of non-existent rewards. If the system is operating as intended, rewards can only be claimed when there has been a genuine profit that increases the gauge's profit index. In simple terms, users should only be able to claim rewards when: 1. A profit has been reported to the gauge via \`notifyPnL\`, which increases the \`gaugeProfitIndex\`. 2. The user's \`userGaugeProfitIndex\` is less than the updated \`gaugeProfitIndex\`, indicating they have not yet claimed the newly reported profits. The potential concern initially raised about initializing both indices (\`gaugeProfitIndex\` and \`userGaugeProfitIndex\`) to \`1e18\` if they are zero is more of a design decision than a vulnerability. It creates a non-zero baseline for these indices. This is not inherently a vulnerability because it does not allow users to claim profits that don't exist; the delta (\`deltaIndex\`) would still be zero if there have been no profits added to the gauge. The only way for \`deltaIndex\` to be non-zero (which would result in rewards being claimable) is for the actual \`gaugeProfitIndex\` to increase due to profits being added to the gauge. Without such an increase, there are no new rewards to claim, and the mechanism works as expected. Here's why this design is not a vulnerability: - Upon initialization or before any profits, both indices default to \`1e18\` effectively setting a baseline. - New profits increase the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` while the user's \`userGaugeProfitIndex\` stays at their last claim level. - The claim function calculates rewards based on the increased \`gaugeProfitIndex\`, which reflects actual profits. - If no profits have been made (i.e., the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` hasn't moved from its baseline), the \`deltaIndex\` used in the claim calculation will be zero, and no rewards will be distributed. The real safeguard against the vulnerability of distributing non-existent rewards lies in accurately accounting for profits and ensuring that the \`notifyPnL\` function is the only way the \`gaugeProfitIndex\` can increase. If both indices are at \`1e18\`, and no profits have been reported and processed through \`notifyPnL\`, there will be no rewards to disburse because the delta remains zero. It's essential that contract creators thoroughly test these mechanisms and potentially have code audits performed to validate the logic, as even small discrepancies in the token distribution logic could lead to significant financial implications for a deployed smart contract system."},{"instruction":"Create a random match-up of two Division I college football teams","output":"Match-up: University of Alabama Crimson Tide vs. University of Oregon Ducks"},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Consultez le détail de la procédure d’inscription : Informations sur la procédure d’inscription Conditions d’admission Les indications exposées sur cette page ne peuvent fonder un droit. Seuls les textes légaux font foi. Les conditions sont valables pour l’année en cours. Les conditions d’admission spécifiques pour les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures (maturité, baccalauréat, Abitur, Advanced Levels, etc.) et pour ceux ayant entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école sont détaillées dans les sections suivantes. Veuillez également tenir compte des restrictions détaillées plus bas. Maturités gymnasiales suisses Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures du Royaume-Uni Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni Baccalauréat européen de l’EURSC.eu Baccalauréat international (IB) de l’IBO.org Bachelor d’une HES suisse Autres hautes études en Suisse ou à l’étranger Restrictions et règles de non-admissibilité Maturités gymnasiales suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (certificat cantonal reconnu par la Confédération ou certificat fédéral) sont admis à l’EPFL sans aucune autre condition en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix. Ils peuvent en outre demander à être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, à titre facultatif, dans la limite des places disponibles (selon la procédure ci-dessous). Ils sont dans ce cas soumis aux règles usuelles pour la réussite de ce cours, mais restent admissibles en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix en cas d’échec à ce cours. Une seconde tentative au Cours de mathématiques spéciales n’est en revanche pas possible. Pour être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, les candidats doivent remplir le formulaire de candidature à l’admission au Bachelor, selon le délai usuel. Ils recevront début juin un e-mail leur donnant accès à un test d’auto-évaluation en mathématiques ainsi qu’à un formulaire leur permettant de demander leur admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales dans un délai de trois semaines environ (aucune demande ne pourra être acceptée après ce délai). Une réponse leur parviendra ensuite courant juillet. Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité professionnelle suisse ou d’une maturité spécialisée suisse sont admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, dans la limite des places disponibles. Les candidats qui ont en outre réussi l’examen complémentaire (« passerelle DUBS ») sont assimilés aux candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (voir plus haut). Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE (autre que la Suisse) sont admis en première année du Bachelor si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : le certificat est un titre pré-universitaire sanctionnant une formation générale le certificat est délivré après au moins douze années de formation primaire et secondaire (sans les classes enfantines) dont au moins trois années de formation secondaire supérieure les branches suivantes ont été étudiées durant la formation secondaire supérieure : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique, 3) langue officielle du pays délivrant le certificat, 4) seconde langue moderne, 5) chimie ou biologie, 6) histoire, géographie ou économie et 7) mathématiques appliquées, informatique, philosophie ou troisième langue moderne au moins six de ces sept branches figurent sur le bulletin de notes final déterminant pour l’obtention du certificat, dont les mathématiques et la physique les mathématiques et la physique ont été étudiées et examinées au plus haut niveau possible (voir ci-dessous) et le certificat est d’orientation scientifique (si des orientations sont proposées dans le pays délivrant le certificat) les notes finales de mathématiques et de physique sont égales ou supérieures à 80% de la note maximale la moyenne générale est égale ou supérieure à 80% de la note maximale Par « plus haut niveau possible », il est entendu que les nombres d’années et d’heures d’étude de cette matière sont les plus élevés possibles dans le pays de formation et, lorsque c’est possible, que la matière a fait l’objet d’une épreuve lors des examens finaux. Les options complémentaires de type « mathématiques expertes » ou « mathématiques approfondies » ne sont en revanche pas requises. Une branche qui combine deux disciplines sous un libellé unique et avec une moyenne unique sur les relevés de notes ne peut pas servir à valider deux exigences séparées (p. ex. physique-chimie ne peut pas satisfaire à la fois l’exigence en physique et celle en chimie). Les branches d’histoire, de géographie et de philosophie non générales ne sont en outre pas prises en compte, de même que l’informatique de gestion ou de bureau.

L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers titulaires d’un certificat d’études ou diplôme délivré par un pays non francophone devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Restrictions et règles de non-admissibilité Les candidats qui ne sont pas titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures et qui n’ont pas entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école ne peuvent être admis que par le biais de l’examen d’admission. Les personnes qui ont plus de 25 ans révolus ou qui ont déjà entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école ou dans un cours préparatoire aux hautes écoles ne sont en principe pas admissibles au Cours de mathématiques spéciales. Elles peuvent cependant s’inscrire à l’examen d’admission. Les personnes qui sont déjà titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) ne sont pas admissibles dans les filières de Bachelor proches de la discipline du titre déjà obtenu. Les personnes ayant quitté, en situation d’échec partiel, une filière universitaire proche des disciplines dispensées à l’EPFL seront refusées ou admises avec restrictions suite à l’analyse de leur dossier. Les personnes ayant quitté, en situation d’échec définitif ou d’exclusion, une filière universitaire proche des disciplines dispensées à l’EPFL ne sont pas admissibles. Une absence de réussite sur deux ans dans une même filière est considérée comme un échec définitif. Les personnes ayant quitté plus d’une filière universitaire, toutes disciplines confondues, sans avoir obtenu le titre correspondant ne sont pas admissibles. Les personnes qui ne sont pas admissibles après avoir quitté une ou plusieurs filière(s) universitaire(s) ne peuvent en outre pas s’inscrire à l’examen d’admission.","output":"Je comprends que les conditions d'admission à l'École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) peuvent être complexes à interpréter. Cependant, il est essentiel de savoir que l'EPFL offre un programme préparatoire appelé le Cours de Mathématiques Spéciales (CMS) pour les élèves dont les diplômes de fin d'études secondaires ne répondent pas directement aux critères d'admission pour les programmes de Bachelor. Pour les étudiants ayant obtenu un baccalauréat technologique STI2D (Sciences et Technologies de l'Industrie et du Développement Durable) en France, l'admission directe au programme de Bachelor de l'EPFL n'est généralement pas possible. Cela s'explique par les différences de curriculum entre le baccalauréat français général et le baccalauréat technologique. En revanche, les candidats titulaires d'un baccalauréat technologique français peuvent postuler pour l'admission au CMS dans la mesure où ce cours préparatoire est destiné à les préparer pour répondre par la suite aux exigences du Bachelor de l'EPFL. Le CMS est un programme d'un an qui permet aux étudiants de suivre des cours intensifs en mathématiques et en sciences physiques afin de combler les éventuelles lacunes et de se préparer aux études en Bachelor de l'EPFL. La sélection pour ce cours est compétitive et se base sur le dossier scolaire du candidat. Pour améliorer vos chances d'admission, assurez-vous de: - Avoir de très bonnes notes en mathématiques et en physique, de préférence au plus haut niveau disponible dans votre programme STI2D. - Démontrer une bonne maîtrise de la langue française (niveau B2 minimum recommandé), car les cours à l'EPFL sont dispensés en français (pour les premières années de Bachelor). - Présenter des recommandations ou des attestations qui témoignent de votre motivation et de votre capacité à réussir dans un environnement académique exigeant. Votre dossier de candidature devra être bien préparé et inclure vos bulletins de notes, vos résultats aux examens, des lettres de recommandation et une lettre de motivation. Il est également essentiel de respecter les délais d'inscription et de s'assurer que votre dossier est complet. Veillez à consulter régulièrement le site de l'EPFL pour obtenir des informations récentes et détaillées sur la procédure d'admission et les critères spécifiques en vigueur au moment de votre candidature, car ces informations peuvent évoluer. Si vous avez des questions précises ou des doutes, n'hésitez pas à contacter le service d'admission de l'EPFL pour obtenir des éclaircissements supplémentaires."},{"instruction":"давай подробно заготовим ответы преподавателю на эти 10 вопросов заватра зачет, это физика 2 курс, что бы еще формулы были и пиши их сразу понятно без формул latex.

Основные положения МКТ и их опытные доказательства: - Вещество состоит из молекул, которые находятся в непрерывном хаотическом движении. - Между молекулами существуют притяжение и отталкивание, и если расстояние между ними велико, силы взаимодействия малы. - Молекулярное движение тем интенсивнее, чем выше температура тела. Опытные доказательства: броуновское движение, диффузия, измерение давления газов. Основные понятия МКТ: молекула, давление, температура, абсолютный ноль, средняя кинетическая энергия. 2. Идеальный газ и основное уравнение МКТ идеального газа: Давление (P) идеального газа - результат столкновений молекул с поверхностью сосуда. Температура (T) - мера средней кинетической энергии молекул. Термодинамическое равновесие - состояние, при котором температура и давление в системе остаются неизменными со временем. Основное уравнение МКТ: \`P = (1/3) * m * n * (v квадратное среднее)\`, где m - масса молекулы, n - концентрация молекул, v квадратное среднее - среднеквадратическая скорость молекул. 3. Распределение Максвелла: Распределение вероятностей скоростей молекул в идеальном газе, характеризующееся температурой газа. Средняя арифметическая скорость: \`v среднее = (8 * k * T / (π * m))^(1/2)\`, где k - постоянная Больцмана, T - температура газа, m - масса молекулы. Средняя квадратичная скорость: \`v квадратное среднее = (3 * k * T / m)^(1/2)\`. 4. Изотермический процесс и закон Бойля-Мариотта: \`P * V = const\` при постоянной температуре (T). График изотермического процесса в координатах P-V - гипербола. 5. Изобарный процесс и закон Гей-Люссака: \`V / T = const\` при постоянном давлении (P). График изобарного процесса в координатах V-T - прямая линия, проходящая через начало координат. 6. Изохорный процесс и закон Шарля: \`P / T = const\` при постоянном объеме (V). График изохорного процесса в координатах P-T - прямая линия, проходящая через начало координат. 7. Закон Дальтона, закон Авогадро, уравнение Клапейрона и уравнение Менделеева-Клапейрона: Закон Дальтона: Полное давление смеси газов равно сумме парциальных давлений. Закон Авогадро: При одинаковых давлениях и температурах равные объемы газов содержат одинаковое количество молекул. Уравнение Клапейрона: \`PV = nRT\`, где P - давление, V - объем, n - количество молей, R - универсальная газовая постоянная, T - абсолютная температура. Уравнение состояния идеального газа (уравнение Менделеева-Клапейрона): \`PV = (m/M)RT\`, где m - масса газа, M - молярная масса газа. 8. Внутренняя энергия, число степеней свободы и закон Больцмана: Внутренняя энергия (U) - сумма кинетической энергии всех молекул газа. Число степеней свободы (i) - количество независимых способов, которыми система может совершать работу. Закон Больцмана: \`U = (i/2)nRT\`, где n - количество молей газа. 9. Первое начало термодинамики: Первый закон термодинамики: \`ΔU = Q − W\`, где ΔU - изменение внутренней энергии системы, Q - теплота подводимая к системе, W - работа, совершаемая системой. Вечный двигатель первого рода - гипотетическое устройство, которое совершает работу без подвода к нему энергии, что противоречит первому закону термодинамики. 10. Второе начало термодинамики: Утверждает, что количество энтропии в замкнутой системе может только возрастать. Это приводит к необратимости тепловых процессов и невозможности создания вечного двигателя второго рода, который сможет полностью превращать получаемую теплоту в работу."},{"instruction":"ну пожалуйста сделай просто 10 подробных ответов, с формулами","output":"Конечно, давайте подготовим подробные ответы с формулами: 1. Основные положения молекулярно-кинетической теории (МКТ): - Вещество состоит из отдельных частиц (атомов, молекул), которые находятся в постоянном хаотическом движении. - Между частицами существует пространство, и они взаимодействуют друг с другом посредством сил притяжения и отталкивания. - Состояние веществ и физические явления можно объяснить исходя из движения и взаимодействий молекул. МКТ объясняет давление газа как результат множества ударов молекул о стенки сосуда. Доказательствами этой теории служат такие явления, как броуновское движение, диффузия, а также измерения давления газов. 2. Идеальный газ, давление, температура, термодинамическое равновесие: Идеальный газ – это модель газа, в которой частицы считаются материальными точками, столкновения между которыми абсолютно упругие, а силы взаимодействия между ними пренебрежимо малы, кроме моментов столкновения. Давление (P) – это сила, действующая перпендикулярно на единицу поверхности стенки сосуда со стороны газа. Температура (T) – это мера средней кинетической энергии частиц газа. Термодинамическое равновесие – состояние системы, при котором её макроскопические параметры (P, V, T) не изменяются со временем. Основное уравнение МКТ идеального газа: P = (1/3) * m * n * (v^2)_(ср кв), где m – масса одной молекулы, n – концентрация молекул, (v^2)_(ср кв) – среднее квадратичное значение скорости молекул. 3. Распределение Максвелла: Распределение Максвелла показывает, с какой вероятностью молекулы газа имеют определенную скорость. Средняя скорость молекул рассчитывается по формуле: v_(ср) = (8kT/(πm))^(1/2), где k – постоянная Больцмана, T – абсолютная температура, m – масса молекулы. Среднеквадратичная скорость определяется выражением: v_(ср кв) = (3kT/m)^(1/2). 4. Изотермический процесс (Закон Бойля-Мариотта): P*V = const при T = const. График в координатах P-V представляет собой гиперболу. 5. Изобарный процесс (Закон Гей-Люссака): V/T = const при P = const. График в координатах V-T является прямой, проходящей через начало координат. 6. Изохорный процесс (Закон Шарля): P/T = const при V = const. График в координатах P-T также представляет собой прямую линию, исходящую из начала координат. 7. Закон Дальтона и закон Авогадро: Закон Дальтона: P_общ = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + ..., где P_общ – общее давление смеси, P_1, P_2, P_3, ... – парциальные давления компонентов смеси. Закон Авогадро: V/n = const при P = const, T = const, где V – объем газа, n – количество молей газа. Уравнение Клапейрона-Менделеева: PV = nRT, где R – универсальная газовая постоянная. Уравнение состояния идеального газа: PV = (m/M)RT, где m – масса газа, M – молярная масса. 8. Внутренняя энергия и число степеней свободы: U = (i/2)nRT, где U – внутренняя энергия, i – число степеней свободы молекулы. 9. Первое начало термодинамики: ΔU = Q - W, где ΔU – изменение внутренней энергии системы, Q – количество теплоты, переданное системе, W – работа, совершенная системой. 10. Второе начало термодинамики утверждает, что тепло самопроизвольно переходит только от более горячего тела к более холодному, и невозможно полное преобразование теплоты в механическую работу. Это приводит к понятию энтропии, которая является мерой необратимого рассеивания энергии, и делает невозможным создание вечного двигателя второго рода."},{"instruction":"قم بتشكيل النص التالي تشكيلا لغوياً سليما لكل حرف: أحبكِ، والكلمات مني تتبعثرُ، وأنتِ خجلى، تقولين “شكرًا”، لكن القلبُ يفضحُ النظرات وحبكِ في عينيكِ أوضحُ من كل العبارات","output":"أَحِبُّكِ، وَالْكَلِمَاتُ مِنِّي تَتَبَعْثَرُ، وَأَنْتِ خَجْلَى، تَقُولِينَ \\"شُكْرًا\\"، لَكِنَّ الْقَلْبَ يُفْضِحُ النَّظَرَاتِ وَحُبُّكِ فِي عَيْنَيْكِ أَوْضَحُ مِنْ كُلِّ الْعِبَارَاتِ"},{"instruction":"is there a word synonymous to/ means swept aside/ swept under the carpet","output":"Yes, there are several words and phrases that have a similar meaning to \\"swept aside\\" or \\"swept under the carpet,\\" which generally refer to ignoring, hiding, or dismissing an issue or problem.

But beneath the surface convenience lies a surprising environmental cost (Griffiths, 2020). Each click and stream may seem ephemeral, yet they cumulatively exert a tangible strain on our planet. As a seasoned digital native, I’ve witnessed firsthand the burgeoning demand for energy precipitated by our online conduct, which, in turn, escalates carbon emissions and resource depletion.

Yet, beneath the veneer of this unprecedented digital convenience lurks a substantial environmental toll—a truth eloquently articulated by Griffiths (2020). Each seemingly transient click and stream contributes to an aggregate strain on our planet's resources. Drawing upon my extensive experience as a digital native, I can attest to the burgeoning energy demands fueled by our collective online activities, which inexorably escalate carbon emissions and hasten resource depletion. Unseen by many, the underpinnings of digital infrastructure—primarily data centers—embody a formidable source of carbon footprint (Belkhir & Elmeligi, 2018). It is a common misapprehension that the ephemeral nature of our digital interactions negates their environmental implications. Yet, the reality is that each email sent, video streamed, and website visited cumulatively demands substantial energy, usually sourced from fossil fuel-dependent power plants, thus exacerbating global carbon emissions. This synthesis underscores a critical call to action—awareness and a commitment to mitigate the digital domain's ecological expenditures are paramount. It integrates scholarly insights (Cook & Pachauri, 2021; Malmodin & Lundén, 2018) and reflects upon my personal reckoning with this modern dilemma. Profoundly, it is my journey of enlightenment that encapsulates our shared responsibility to reconcile our online habits with the imperatives of environmental conservation.

Suite à l’entrée en vigueur de la dernière mise à jour de l’Ordonnance sur l’admission à l’EPFL et en vue de l’entrée en vigueur de la dernière mise à jour de l’Ordonnance sur la reconnaissance des certificats de maturité gymnasiale, les conditions d’admission pour les certificats d’études étatiques étrangers et privés ont évolué significativement. Merci de prendre attentivement connaissance des nouvelles conditions décrites sur cette page. Inscription Vous êtes au clair sur les conditions d’admission et désirez vous inscrire ? Consultez le détail de la procédure d’inscription : Informations sur la procédure d’inscription Conditions d’admission Les indications exposées sur cette page ne peuvent fonder un droit. Seuls les textes légaux font foi. Les conditions sont valables pour l’année en cours. Les conditions d’admission spécifiques pour les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures (maturité, baccalauréat, Abitur, Advanced Levels, etc.) et pour ceux ayant entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école sont détaillées dans les sections suivantes. Veuillez également tenir compte des restrictions détaillées plus bas. Maturités gymnasiales suisses Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures du Royaume-Uni Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni Baccalauréat européen de l’EURSC.eu Baccalauréat international (IB) de l’IBO.org Bachelor d’une HES suisse Autres hautes études en Suisse ou à l’étranger Restrictions et règles de non-admissibilité Maturités gymnasiales suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (certificat cantonal reconnu par la Confédération ou certificat fédéral) sont admis à l’EPFL sans aucune autre condition en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix. Ils peuvent en outre demander à être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, à titre facultatif, dans la limite des places disponibles (selon la procédure ci-dessous). Ils sont dans ce cas soumis aux règles usuelles pour la réussite de ce cours, mais restent admissibles en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix en cas d’échec à ce cours. Une seconde tentative au Cours de mathématiques spéciales n’est en revanche pas possible. Pour être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, les candidats doivent remplir le formulaire de candidature à l’admission au Bachelor, selon le délai usuel. Ils recevront début juin un e-mail leur donnant accès à un test d’auto-évaluation en mathématiques ainsi qu’à un formulaire leur permettant de demander leur admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales dans un délai de trois semaines environ (aucune demande ne pourra être acceptée après ce délai). Une réponse leur parviendra ensuite courant juillet. Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité professionnelle suisse ou d’une maturité spécialisée suisse sont admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, dans la limite des places disponibles. Les candidats qui ont en outre réussi l’examen complémentaire (« passerelle DUBS ») sont assimilés aux candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (voir plus haut). Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE (autre que la Suisse) sont admis en première année du Bachelor si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : le certificat est un titre pré-universitaire sanctionnant une formation générale le certificat est délivré après au moins douze années de formation primaire et secondaire (sans les classes enfantines) dont au moins trois années de formation secondaire supérieure les branches suivantes ont été étudiées durant la formation secondaire supérieure : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique, 3) langue officielle du pays délivrant le certificat, 4) seconde langue moderne, 5) chimie ou biologie, 6) histoire, géographie ou économie et 7) mathématiques appliquées, informatique, philosophie ou troisième langue moderne au moins six de ces sept branches figurent sur le bulletin de notes final déterminant pour l’obtention du certificat, dont les mathématiques et la physique les mathématiques et la physique ont été étudiées et examinées au plus haut niveau possible (voir ci-dessous) et le certificat est d’orientation scientifique (si des orientations sont proposées dans le pays délivrant le certificat) les notes finales de mathématiques et de physique sont égales ou supérieures à 80% de la note maximale la moyenne générale est égale ou supérieure à 80% de la note maximale Par « plus haut niveau possible », il est entendu que les nombres d’années et d’heures d’étude de cette matière sont les plus élevés possibles dans le pays de formation et, lorsque c’est possible, que la matière a fait l’objet d’une épreuve lors des examens finaux. Les options complémentaires de type « mathématiques expertes » ou « mathématiques approfondies » ne sont en revanche pas requises. Une branche qui combine deux disciplines sous un libellé unique et avec une moyenne unique sur les relevés de notes ne peut pas servir à valider deux exigences séparées (p. ex. physique-chimie ne peut pas satisfaire à la fois l’exigence en physique et celle en chimie). Les branches d’histoire, de géographie et de philosophie non générales ne sont en outre pas prises en compte, de même que l’informatique de gestion ou de bureau. Les statistiques, la géométrie descriptive, la visualisation des données, la finance quantitative et la cryptologie sont considérées comme des mathématiques appliquées. Dans certains cas, la page dédiée à votre pays de formation (section « EPFL ») dans la rubrique « Pays » du site de swissuniversities fournit des précisions quant à l’application des règles ci-dessus, à titre indicatif. Ce site n’est mis à jour qu’une fois par année en janvier et les conditions peuvent donc ne pas être à jour lors de l’ouverture de notre formulaire de candidature en novembre. L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers qui n’ont pas étudié le français durant leur formation secondaire supérieure devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Les candidats qui résident et étudient en Suisse pour un motif professionnel (travail en Suisse ou résidence avec leurs parents, qui travaillent en Suisse) au moment de leur formation secondaire supérieure sont admis en première année du Bachelor avec une moyenne générale égale ou supérieure à 70% de la note maximale. Toutes les autres conditions restent inchangées et doivent être remplies. Les candidats suisses de l’étranger peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) avec une moyenne générale un peu inférieure à 80% de la note maximale. Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures du Royaume-Uni Les candidats titulaires d’Advanced Levels britanniques et/ou d’Advanced Highers écossais sont admis en première année du Bachelor si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : les branches suivantes ont été étudiées et examinées en tant qu’Advanced Levels et/ou Advanced Highers : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique et 3) chimie, biologie ou informatique les branches suivantes ont été étudiées et examinées au niveau du GCSE et/ou des Standard Grades ou à un niveau plus élevé (Advanced Subsidiary Levels, Advanced Levels, Highers et/ou Advanced Highers) : 1) anglais, 2) seconde langue moderne et 3) histoire ou géographie les notes de mathématiques et de physique, ainsi que de chimie, de biologie ou d’informatique, sont égales ou supérieures à A et/ou 1 « Mathematics » et « Further Mathematics » sont tous les deux acceptés. L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers qui n’ont pas étudié le français durant leur formation secondaire supérieure devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Les candidats suisses de l’étranger peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) avec des notes un peu inférieures à A et/ou 1. Les candidats titulaires d’Advanced Levels internationaux accrédités par un État tiers (CIE, Edexcel, OxfordAQA, LRN) sont soumis aux conditions d’admission pour les titulaires de certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni, telles que décrites ci-dessous. Les candidats titulaires d’Advanced Levels internationaux sans accréditation étatique (CIE, Edexcel, OxfordAQA, LRN) et/ou de Pre-Us (CIE, LRN) ne peuvent être admis que par le biais de l’examen d’admission. Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni Merci de noter que nous avons constaté une forte augmentation du nombre de candidatures à l’admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales ces dernières années et que nous nous attendons à ce que cette augmentation perdure dans les années à venir. Les places étant limitées dans ce cours, l’admission est de plus en plus sélective. L’admission n’est en aucun cas garantie pour tous les candidats qui remplissent les critères indiqués ci-dessous. Les candidats qui ne sont pas admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales peuvent malgré tout être admis en première année du Bachelor par le biais de notre examen d’admission. Les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : le certificat est un titre pré-universitaire sanctionnant une formation générale le certificat est délivré après au moins douze années de formation primaire et secondaire (sans les classes enfantines) dont au moins trois années de formation secondaire supérieure les branches suivantes ont été étudiées durant la formation secondaire supérieure : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique, 3) langue officielle du pays délivrant le certificat, 4) seconde langue moderne, 5) chimie ou biologie, 6) histoire, géographie ou économie et 7) mathématiques appliquées, informatique, philosophie ou troisième langue moderne au moins six de ces sept branches figurent sur le bulletin de notes final déterminant pour l’obtention du certificat, dont les mathématiques et la physique les mathématiques et la physique ont été étudiées et examinées au plus haut niveau possible (voir ci-dessous) et le certificat est d’orientation scientifique (si des orientations sont proposées dans le pays délivrant le certificat) les notes finales de mathématiques et de physique sont égales ou supérieures à 80% de la note maximale la moyenne générale est égale ou supérieure à 80% de la note maximale Par « plus haut niveau possible », il est entendu que les nombres d’années et d’heures d’étude de cette matière sont les plus élevés possibles dans le pays de formation et, lorsque c’est possible, que la matière a fait l’objet d’une épreuve lors des examens finaux.

Les statistiques, la géométrie descriptive, la visualisation des données, la finance quantitative et la cryptologie sont considérées comme des mathématiques appliquées. Pour les pays qui ont un système d’éducation secondaire supérieure similaire aux Advanced Levels britanniques (Brunei, Hong Kong, Maurice et Singapour), les critères pour l’admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, sont basés sur ceux qui s’appliquent pour l’admission en première année du Bachelor des titulaires d’Advanced Levels britanniques, tels que décrits ci-dessus. Dans certains cas, la section dédiée à votre pays de formation dans le document PDF « Conditions pour postuler pour l’admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales à l’EPFL » fournit des précisions quant à l’application des règles ci-dessus, à titre indicatif seulement. Les titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures délivré par un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni ne figurant pas dans ce document ne peuvent être admis que par le biais de l’examen d’admission. Ce document n’est mis à jour qu’une fois par année en décembre et les conditions peuvent donc ne pas être à jour lors de l’ouverture de notre formulaire de candidature en novembre.

Bachelor d’une HES suisse Les candidats titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) d’une HES suisse sont admis sans condition en première année du Bachelor, sauf dans les filières proches de la discipline du titre de Bachelor déjà obtenu pour lesquelles une admission au Master est possible. Autres hautes études en Suisse ou à l’étranger Les candidats titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) d’une EPF, Université cantonale ou HEP suisse sont admis sans condition en première année du Bachelor, sauf dans les filières proches de la discipline du titre de Bachelor déjà obtenu. Les candidats titulaires d’un titre de Master (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) d’une EPF ou Université cantonale suisse sont admis sans condition en première année du Bachelor. Les candidats titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor ou de Master (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) d’une Université étrangère, d’un niveau jugé équivalent aux titres de l’EPFL, peuvent être admis sans condition, sur dossier, en première année du Bachelor. Pour être jugé équivalent aux titres de l’EPFL, un titre universitaire étranger doit notamment avoir été délivré par une Université accréditée par un gouvernement national, sanctionner la réussite d’un cursus de trois ans ou plus et avoir été obtenu dans une discipline qui est universitaire en Suisse. Les candidats qui ont réussi au moins une année d’études dans une filière d’études universitaire jugée équivalente à celles dispensées à l’EPFL peuvent demander à être admis, sur dossier, en deuxième année du programme de Bachelor dans une discipline proche de la filière entamée préalablement, à condition de remplir par ailleurs les conditions d’admission en première année. S’ils sont admis, ces candidats le seront soit en première année, soit en deuxième année avec ou sans restrictions, suite à l’analyse de leur dossier. Les candidats qui sont en situation de réussite à l’ETHZ dans une discipline proposée dans les deux EPF suisses sont admis sans restrictions au semestre supérieur du programme de Bachelor dans la même discipline à l’EPFL. L’admission en deuxième ou troisième année du programme de Bachelor est prononcée pour une discipline spécifique. Un changement de discipline n’est en principe pas autorisé. Les candidats admis en deuxième ou troisième année ne sont en outre pas autorisés à effectuer la troisième année du programme de Bachelor en mobilité académique dans une autre Université. L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers titulaires d’un certificat d’études ou diplôme délivré par un pays non francophone devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Restrictions et règles de non-admissibilité Les candidats qui ne sont pas titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures et qui n’ont pas entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école ne peuvent être admis que par le biais de l’examen d’admission. Les personnes qui ont plus de 25 ans révolus ou qui ont déjà entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école ou dans un cours préparatoire aux hautes écoles ne sont en principe pas admissibles au Cours de mathématiques spéciales. Elles peuvent cependant s’inscrire à l’examen d’admission. Les personnes qui sont déjà titulaires d’un titre de Bachelor (ou autre titre jugé équivalent) ne sont pas admissibles dans les filières de Bachelor proches de la discipline du titre déjà obtenu. Les personnes ayant quitté, en situation d’échec partiel, une filière universitaire proche des disciplines dispensées à l’EPFL seront refusées ou admises avec restrictions suite à l’analyse de leur dossier. Les personnes ayant quitté, en situation d’échec définitif ou d’exclusion, une filière universitaire proche des disciplines dispensées à l’EPFL ne sont pas admissibles. Une absence de réussite sur deux ans dans une même filière est considérée comme un échec définitif. Les personnes ayant quitté plus d’une filière universitaire, toutes disciplines confondues, sans avoir obtenu le titre correspondant ne sont pas admissibles. Les personnes qui ne sont pas admissibles après avoir quitté une ou plusieurs filière(s) universitaire(s) ne peuvent en outre pas s’inscrire à l’examen d’admission.","output":"Bonjour, En tant qu'étudiant en terminale STI2D en France, vous essayer de comprendre si vous pouvez postuler au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (CMS) en vue d'une entrée ultérieure en première année de Bachelor à l'École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) en Suisse. Les informations que vous avez trouvées sur les conditions d'admission semblent assez complexes car elles couvrent un large éventail de situations et de certificats d'études secondaires supérieures de différents pays. La voie la plus standard d'admission en première année de Bachelor à l'EPFL est réservée aux titulaires de certaines certifications, comme la maturité gymnasiale suisse ou le baccalauréat français avec des notes élevées dans des matières scientifiques spécifiques. Cependant, les diplômés du baccalauréat technologique STI2D ne sont généralement pas directement admissibles à cet accès direct en raison de la nature technique et moins généraliste de leur parcours. Le CMS est un programme préparatoire d'un an qui permet aux étudiants de combler les éventuelles lacunes dans les matières scientifiques et de se préparer aux exigences académiques de l'EPFL. L'admission au CMS est également compétitive et est basée sur les qualifications et les notes obtenues au lycée. Sur la base des informations que vous avez fournies, la meilleure approche pour vous serait de contacter directement l'office d'admission de l'EPFL pour obtenir des informations précises sur votre éligibilité au CMS avec un baccalauréat STI2D. Les politiques d'admission peuvent varier et parfois, des exceptions ou des voies alternatives peuvent être proposées. Pour maximiser vos chances d'admission, votre dossier de candidature devrait idéalement inclure: 1. Des notes élevées dans toutes les matières durant vos années de lycée, particulièrement en mathématiques et en physique. 2. Des preuves de compétences en langue française, car l'EPFL exige un certain niveau de maîtrise du français. 3. Toute expérience supplémentaire pertinente ou des réalisations extra-académiques (projets personnels, stages, activités parascolaires en lien avec la science et la technologie, etc.). N'oubliez pas que les admissions sont compétitives, et chaque année il y a plus de demandes que de places disponibles. Si vous ne répondez pas aux critères d'admission du CMS ou si vous n'êtes pas accepté, vous pourrez envisager l'examen d'admission, lequel est une autre voie d'entrée possible pour les étudiants ne répondant pas aux critères d'admission habituels. Je vous invite donc à prendre contact avec l'administration de l'EPFL pour obtenir des informations personnalisées à votre situation et pour discuter de la marche à suivre pour votre candidature."},{"instruction":"Puis-je être admis aux cms avec mon bac sti2d ?","output":"Les informations disponibles sur le site de l'EPFL concernant l'admission aux Cours de mathématiques spéciales (CMS) n'indiquent pas explicitement l'éligibilité des titulaires d'un baccalauréat technologique STI2D français. Toutefois, étant donné que le CMS est destiné à préparer les étudiants qui n'ont pas le niveau d'entrée directe en première année de Bachelor (typiquement pour ceux qui n'ont pas une maturité gymnasiale suisse ou un diplôme équivalent avec les branches scientifiques requises), il peut y avoir une possibilité pour les titulaires d'autres types de baccalauréat. Pour les étudiants internationaux, les admissions au CMS sont très sélectives, et il est possible que des parcours non traditionnels ou plus techniques comme le STI2D soient considérés au cas par cas. L'admission se basera sur l'examen de votre dossier scolaire et peut dépendre de facteurs tels que vos notes (particulièrement en mathématiques et en sciences), les matières étudiées et la comparabilité de votre parcours avec les attentes académiques de l'EPFL. Il est donc essentiel de contacter directement l'administration de l'EPFL pour poser la question spécifiquement pour un baccalauréat STI2D. L'office d'admission pourra vous fournir une réponse précise en ce qui concerne votre éligibilité et vous conseiller sur la meilleure démarche à suivre pour votre cas particulier. Si vous découvrez que l'admission au CMS n'est pas possible avec votre baccalauréat STI2D, ils pourront également vous informer sur d'autres options qui pourraient être à votre disposition, comme un examen d’admission ou d'autres pistes préparatoires."},{"instruction":"Voici mon bulletin du premier trimestre de terminal LYCEE LOUIS-LE-GRAND 123 RUE SAINT JACQUES 75005 PARIS SE ARRONDISSEMENT Bulletin du 1er Trimestre Tél. : 01 44 32 82 00 SCHMITZ Angelin Né le 22/03/2006 INE: 173004578GD Année scolaire : 2023/2024 TSTI 2D (31 élèves) Professeurs principaux: M.

De telles notes, surtout en mathématiques et en physique, sont de bons indicateurs pour une candidature au CMS à l'EPFL, mais il est important de noter que les décisions d'admission ne se basent pas uniquement sur les notes. Pour maximiser vos chances d'admission, votre candidature devrait également montrer : 1. Un intérêt et une motivation claire pour les études d'ingénierie et les sciences, avec possiblement des projets extra-académiques ou des stages. 2. Vos compétences linguistiques, particulièrement en français, étant donné que les cours de Bachelor à l'EPFL sont principalement donnés en français. Cependant, n'oubliez pas que l'admission au CMS comme à l'EPFL en général est sélective et repose sur une évaluation globale de votre dossier. Il faudra également tenir compte du niveau de compétitivité de l'année en cours, car le nombre de candidats et le niveau des candidatures peuvent varier d'une année à l'autre, influençant ainsi la difficulté de l'admission. Je vous recommande fortement de contacter l'équipe des admissions de l'EPFL pour leur présenter votre bulletin et demander une évaluation de votre éligibilité précise par rapport aux critères d'admissions au CMS.

The overall theme is about breaking the continuous cycle of stopping women from going on to achieve their full potential, and how the women around me have fueled my passion to help others as a doctor, and inspire young girls from my culture that they don't have to be limited just because of who they are. - my grandmother, ammi. she was the daughter of the police chief of pakistan and went to the best english medium school, but stopped because she was getting married to my grandfather, the son of a generational farming family. she struggled the shift from an urban to a rural lifestyle, but stayed resilient and headstrong, making sure her 5 children got educated. she especially pushed my dad, who worked very hard. he was able to go from doing elementary school on sand as a makeshift chair to getting a PhD. - my great grandmother: had to grow up from a very young age w/o a true childhood, was very strong, kept all of the documents of her family and property as a little girl, and cared for her little brothers. went on to become the most important decision maker of our family. - my mother: she was the top of her class, loved going to school and learning, but had to marry young, and eventually had me, and moved to the united states without a proper support system beyond my father. the essay starts with this: One of the earliest memories I had of my Ammi was of me sitting in the kat in front of her, while her skilled hands quickly seeded through the large steel bowl full of freshly harvested okra. Her long hair, secured with an intricate braid under her sadar. I looked up at her, forming the pashto words inside my head to ask, what are you doing? My pashto would come and go, sometimes at its very best, and sometimes none at all throughout my visits as a child. Regardless, I always understood Ammi, and she always understood me. When one thinks of a grandmotherly figure, they think of warm smiles and freshly baked cookies. And while I also have one of those whom I love with all my heart, Ammi never fully fit into that stereotype. Ammi’s energy was strong, unrelenting, and unapologetically firm. - I want it to be about how the women around me have inspired me so much (include montages of doing henna and it's feminist symbolism, my favorite women in the kitchen, laughing and sharing generations-old stories and history), and how their strength and energy is a part of me. and how it gives me the determination and passion to become a doctor. 650 words!","output":"Title: Unleashing the Power Within: Breaking Barriers, Inspiring Change Introduction One of my earliest memories is of sitting in front of my Ammi, mesmerized by her skilled hands swiftly preparing freshly harvested okra.

Ammi, along with the remarkable women in my family, has fueled my passion to break the cycle that hinders women from achieving their full potential. Their strength and energy serve as a constant reminder of the importance of empowering others and inspiring young girls from our culture to overcome societal limitations. Through my journey to become a doctor, I aspire to make a lasting impact, challenging stereotypes and encouraging women to rise above the constraints that hold them back. The Power of Generations My grandmother, Ammi, was born into a privileged family. However, societal expectations forced her to abandon her education and embrace a rural lifestyle after her marriage. Undeterred by the limitations imposed upon her, Ammi remained resilient and headstrong, ensuring that her five children received an education. I am deeply inspired by her unwavering commitment to breaking barriers and creating opportunities for her family. Through her efforts, my father, overcoming immense challenges, triumphed over adversity to pursue a PhD. Ammi's journey taught me the vital role education plays in empowering individuals to transcend societal expectations and achieve greatness.

Her long hair, secured with an intricate braid under her sadar. I looked up at her, forming the Pashto words inside my head to ask, \\"What are you doing?\\" My pashto would come and go, sometimes at its very best, and sometimes none at all throughout my visits as a child. Regardless, I always understood Ammi, and she always understood me. When one thinks of a grandmotherly figure, they think of warm smiles and freshly baked cookies. And while I also have one of those whom I love with all my heart, Ammi never fully fit into that stereotype. Ammi's energy was strong, unrelenting, and unapologetically firm. Ammi, my grandmother, was the daughter of the police chief of Pakistan. She attended the best English-medium school, but her education came to a halt once she married my grandfather, the son of a generational farming family. The shift from an urban to a rural lifestyle was challenging for her, but she stayed resilient and headstrong, making sure her five children received an education. She especially pushed my dad, who worked very hard. He went from doing elementary school on sand as a makeshift chair to getting a PhD. Generations before Ammi, my great-grandmother had to grow up from a very young age without a true childhood. She was strong, caring for her little brothers and becoming the most important decision-maker of our family. She kept all the family documents and property, ensuring their preservation and safeguarding our heritage. Continuing in the theme of empowering women, my mother's journey serves as a reminder that education is transformative. Despite being the top of her class and loving school, my mother had to marry young and eventually had me. Moving to the United States without a proper support system beyond my father was challenging for her, but she tackled it with unwavering determination. Her relentless pursuit of knowledge and unwavering support for my aspirations have instilled in me a profound sense of gratitude and a passion to advocate for gender equality. Gatherings with my family have always been filled with joy, laughter, and shared stories that intertwine generations.

Here's why an ANN might not be able to memorize an arbitrarily large training dataset: 1. **Capacity:** A neural network's capacity to memorize data is determined by the number of its parameters (weights and biases), which is directly related to the network's architecture (number and size of layers). A network with a finite number of parameters can only store a finite amount of information. This is analogous to trying to store the entire contents of the internet on a single computer hard drive—there's simply not enough space. 2. **Overfitting and Generalization:** Neural networks are typically designed to generalize from examples rather than memorize them. This is because the goal of machine learning is often not to make perfect predictions on seen data, but to make accurate predictions on unseen data (generalization). When a network starts memorizing data, it's usually a sign of overfitting, which means it performs poorly on new, unseen data. To prevent overfitting, various techniques like regularization, dropout, and early stopping are used, which in turn limit the network's ability to memorize the data perfectly. 3. **Optimization and Local Minima:** The process of training a neural network involves optimizing its parameters to reduce the difference between the predicted and actual values (loss). This optimization is a challenging task, especially with large datasets and complex networks, because the loss landscape is high-dimensional and may contain many local minima. The algorithms used for training (like stochastic gradient descent) might not find the global minimum that represents a perfect memorization of the dataset but instead find a suboptimal set of parameters. 4. **Data Complexity:** As the complexity and size of the dataset increase, the difficulty of finding a function that can perfectly map inputs to outputs grows. A large and complex dataset may contain conflicting examples (e.g., identical inputs with different outputs), noise, and subtle patterns that a neural network with a fixed size might struggle to learn perfectly. 5. **Resource Constraints:** Practically, there are always resource constraints in terms of available computational power and memory. Larger models require more resources, and training them on very large datasets requires massive computational capacity, which may not be feasible. To recap, while it's theoretically possible for a large-enough neural network to memorize an arbitrarily large training dataset, practical limitations of architecture, optimization, and resource constraints will typically prevent this from happening. Additionally, the pursuit of memorization is contrary to the objective of building models that generalize well to new data."},{"instruction":"设计助理的未来展望","output":"设计助理的未来展望是多样化和全面发展，以下是一些可能的展望： 1. 技术驱动：随着科技的不断发展，设计助理将更多地受到技术的驱动。他们将使用各种设计软件和工具来辅助设计工作，例如3D建模、虚拟现实、人工智能等。技术的进步将为设计助理提供更多创新的机会和工具。 2. 转型数字化：设计助理将逐渐转向数字化工作环境。他们将通过云平台和在线协作工具与团队进行实时合作，增强工作效率和灵活性。数字化化工作环境也将为设计助理提供更多学习和交流的机会。 3. 多元化技能：设计助理将需要具备更多的技能和知识。除了设计技能，他们还需要了解市场趋势、商业模式、用户体验等方面的知识。多元化的技能将使设计助理在团队中发挥更加重要的作用。 4. 成为创意领导者：设计助理将有机会成为创意领导者。他们将参与项目的实际设计过程，并提供独立的创意和建议。设计助理将承担更多的责任，与团队合作，成为项目的推动者和创新者。 5. 增强可持续发展意识：设计助理将会更加关注可持续发展。他们将尝试使用环保材料和设计理念，提供更加可持续、环保的设计方案。设计助理将在设计工作中注重资源的合理利用和环境保护。 总体而言，设计助理的未来展望是多元化、技术驱动和可持续发展。他们将不断学习和成长，成为团队中不可或缺的一员，为创意产业的发展做出贡献。"},{"instruction":"can you convert it to another gui as pyqt5 or somehing, but not tiker?: import tkinter as tk from tkinter import ttk, scrolledtext from threading import Thread, Lock import re import socket import netifaces lock = Lock() def extract_ips(bridge_data): pattern = re.compile(r’(d{1,3}(?:.d{1,3}){3}:d+)‘) ips_with_ports = pattern.findall(bridge_data) return ips_with_ports def update_console(message): with lock: console_display.configure(state=‘normal’) console_display.insert(tk.END, message + “n”) console_display.configure(state=‘disabled’) console_display.yview(tk.END) def is_port_open(ip, port, timeout): sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) sock.settimeout(timeout) try: sock.connect((ip, port)) return True except socket.error: return False finally: sock.close() def check_ip_port(ip, port, timeout): if is_port_open(ip, port, timeout): update_console(f\\"Connection successful for {ip}:{port}“) return True else: update_console(f\\"Connection failed for {ip}:{port}”) return False def check_bridges(): raw_data = bridge_input.get(‘1.0’, tk.END) ip_port_pairs = extract_ips(raw_data) timeout = float(timeout_entry.get()) def process_ips(): responsive_bridges = [] for ip_port in ip_port_pairs: ip, port = ip_port.split(’:‘) if check_ip_port(ip, int(port), timeout): responsive_bridges.append(ip_port) with lock: responsive_data = ‘n’.join([line for line in raw_data.split(’n’) if any(ip_port in line for ip_port in responsive_bridges)]) result_display.configure(state=‘normal’) result_display.delete(‘1.0’, tk.END) result_display.insert(tk.END, responsive_data) result_display.configure(state=‘disabled’) status_label.config(text=“Check completed”) for _ in range(int(thread_count_entry.get())): thread = Thread(target=process_ips) thread.start() def get_network_interfaces(): interfaces_list = netifaces.interfaces() return interfaces_list def clear_console(): console_display.configure(state=‘normal’) console_display.delete(‘1.0’, tk.END) console_display.configure(state=‘disabled’) root = tk.Tk() root.title(“Tor Bridge Connectivity Checker”) frame = ttk.Frame(root, padding=“3”) frame.grid(column=0, row=0, sticky=(tk.W, tk.E, tk.N, tk.S)) frame.columnconfigure(0, weight=1) interfaces = get_network_interfaces() net_interface_label = ttk.Label(frame, text=“Network Interface:”) net_interface_label.grid(column=0, row=0, sticky=tk.W) net_interface_selector = ttk.Combobox(frame, values=interfaces) net_interface_selector.grid(column=1, row=0, sticky=(tk.W, tk.E), columnspan=3) thread_count_label = ttk.Label(frame, text=“Thread Count:”) thread_count_label.grid(column=4, row=0, sticky=tk.W, padx=(4, 0)) thread_count_entry = ttk.Spinbox(frame, from_=1, to=100, increment=1, width=7) thread_count_entry.set(10) #

Основные понятия МКТ: - Все вещества состоят из молекул, которые находятся в постоянном движении. - Молекулы взаимодействуют друг с другом при столкновении и через силы притяжения или отталкивания на расстоянии. - Макроскопические свойства вещества определяются среднестатистическим поведением большого количества молекул. Опытные доказательства: законы броуновского движения, диффузии, изменение давления и объема при изменении температуры. Основные понятия МКТ: молекула, атом, кинетическая энергия, давление, температура, моль, тепловое движение. 2. Идеальный газ. Давление. Температура. Термодинамическое равновесие. Давление (P) - это сила, действующая на единицу площади поверхности. Определяется как P = F/S, где F - сила, S - площадь. Температура (T) - мера средней кинетической энергии молекул. Термодинамическое равновесие - состояние системы, при котором параметры (давление, объем, температура) остаются постоянными со временем. Основное уравнение МКТ идеального газа: P = (1/3) * n * m * c^2, где n - концентрация молекул, m - масса молекулы, c - средняя скорость молекул. 3. Распределение Максвелла по скоростям молекул. Средняя скорость (средняя арифметическая скорость) молекул обычно меньше средней квадратичной скорости. Средняя квадратичная скорость (v) определяется по формуле v = sqrt((3 * k * T) / m), где k - постоянная Больцмана, T - абсолютная температура, m - масса одной молекулы. 4. Изопроцессы для идеального газа: Изотермический процесс (T = const): P*V = const (Закон Бойля-Мариотта). На графике PV - гипербола. 5. Изопроцессы для идеального газа: Изобарный процесс (P = const): V/T = const (Закон Гей-Люссака). На графике VT - прямая линия. 6. Изопроцессы для идеального газа: Изохорный процесс (V = const): P/T = const (Закон Шарля). На графике PT - прямая линия. 7. Законы и уравнение состояния идеального газа: Закон Дальтона: общее давление смеси газов равно сумме парциальных давлений компонентов. Закон Авогадро: при одинаковом давлении и температуре равные объемы газов содержат одинаковое количество молекул. Уравнение Клапейрона: PV = nRT, где P - давление, V - объем, n - количество вещества в молях, R - универсальная газовая постоянная, T - абсолютная температура. Уравнение состояния идеального газа (уравнение Менделеева-Клапейрона): PV = (m/M)RT, где m - масса газа, M - молярная масса газа. 8. Внутренняя энергия и закон Больцмана: Внутренняя энергия (U) идеального газа зависит только от температуры и числа степеней свободы (f): U = (f/2)nRT. Закон Больцмана о распределении энергии: энергия распределяется между степенями свободы равномерно. 9. Первое начало термодинамики: ΔU = Q + W, где ΔU - изменение внутренней энергии, Q - количество переданной теплоты, W - работа, совершаемая над системой или системой над окружающей средой. Вечный двигатель первого рода невозможен, так как такая машина могла бы производить работу без подвода энергии, нарушая тем самым первое начало термодинамики. 10. Второе начало термодинамики утверждает, что тепло не может самопроизвольно переходить от тела с более низкой температурой к телу с более высокой температурой. Это означает, что степень превращения теплоты в работу ограничена. Вечный двигатель второго рода также невозможен, так как это устройство нарушило бы второе начало термодинамики, совершая работу без какого-либо энергетического обмена с окружающей средой."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Video Ad Feedback See CNN' visit to the nuclear fusion lab trying to replicate the Sun on Earth (May, 2023) 02:24 - Source: CNN CNN — Scientists in California shooting nearly 200 lasers at a cylinder holding a fuel capsule the size of a peppercorn have taken another step in the quest for fusion energy, which, if mastered, could provide the world with a near-limitless source of clean power. Last year on a December morning, scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California (LLNL) managed, in a world first, to produce a nuclear fusion reaction that released more energy than it used, in a process called “ignition.” Now they say they have successfully replicated ignition at least three times this year, according to a December report from the LLNL. This marks another significant step in what could one day be an important solution to the global climate crisis, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. NIF's target chamber is where the magic happens -- temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures extreme enough to compress the target to densities up to 100 times the density of lead are created there. Damien Jemison/LLNL For decades, scientists have attempted to harness fusion energy, essentially recreating the power of the sun on Earth. After making their historic net energy gain last year, the next important step was to prove the process could be replicated. Brian Appelbe, a research fellow from the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said the ability to replicate demonstrates the “robustness” of the process, showing it can be achieved even when conditions such as the laser or fuel pellet are varied. Each experiment also offers an opportunity to study the physics of ignition in detail, Appelbe told CNN. “This provides valuable information to the scientists in addressing the next challenge to be overcome: how to maximize the energy that can be obtained.” Unlike nuclear fission — the process used in the world’s nuclear plants today, which is generated by the division of atoms — nuclear fusion leaves no legacy of long-lived radioactive waste. As the climate crisis accelerates, and the urgency of ditching planet-heating fossil fuels increases, the prospect of an abundant source of safe, clean energy is tantalizing. Nuclear fusion, the reaction that powers the sun and other stars, involves smashing two or more atoms together to form a denser one, in a process that releases huge amounts of energy. NIF's target chamber is where the magic happens -- temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures extreme enough to compress the target to densities up to 100 times the density of lead are created there. Damien Jemison/LLNL US scientists reach long-awaited nuclear fusion breakthrough, source says There are different ways of creating energy from fusion, but at NIF, scientists fire an array of nearly 200 lasers at a pellet of hydrogen fuel inside a diamond capsule the size of a peppercorn, itself inside a gold cylinder. The lasers heat up the cylinder’s outside, creating a series of very fast explosions, generating large amounts of energy collected as heat. The energy produced in December 2022 was small — it took around 2 megajoules to power the reaction, which released a total of 3.15 megajoules, enough to boil around 10 kettles of water. But it was sufficient to make it a successful ignition and to prove that laser fusion could create energy. Since then, the scientists have done it several more times. On July 30, the NIF laser delivered a little over 2 megajoules to the target, which resulted in 3.88 megajoules of energy — their highest yield achieved to date, according to the report. Two subsequent experiments in October also delivered net gains. “These results demonstrated NIF’s ability to consistently produce fusion energy at multi-megajoule levels,” the report said. There is still a very long way to go, however, until nuclear fusion reaches the scale needed to power electric grids and heating systems. The focus now is on building on the progress made and figuring out how to dramatically scale up fusion projects and significantly bring down costs. At the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, US climate envoy John Kerry launched an international engagement plan involving more than 30 countries with the aim of boosting nuclear fusion to help tackle the climate crisis. “There is potential in fusion to revolutionize our world, and to change all of the options that are in front of us, and provide the world with abundant and clean energy without the harmful emissions of traditional energy sources,” Kerry told the climate gathering. In December, the US Department of Energy announced a 42 million investment in a program bringing together multiple institutions, including LLNL, to establish “hubs” focused on advancing fusion. “Harnessing fusion energy is one of the greatest scientific and technological challenges of the 21st Century,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in a statement. “We now have the confidence that it’s not only possible, but probable, that fusion energy can be a reality.” Ella Nilsen and René Marsh contributed to reporting Related Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Search Log In My Account Settings Topics You Follow Log Out Your CNN account Log in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics The Biden Presidency Facts First 2024 Elections Business Markets Tech Media Calculators Videos Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa 2 Degrees CNN Heroes All Features Weather Climate Wildfire Tracker Video More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN World Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Log In My Account Settings Topics You Follow Log Out Your CNN account Log in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2023 Cable News Network.
