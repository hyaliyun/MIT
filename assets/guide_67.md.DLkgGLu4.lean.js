Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","output":"Once upon a recent time, in the land of retail and flat-pack furniture, there was a most unusual IKEA located at the crossroads of dimensions. This store employed people from various universes, realms, and timelines, and among these employees were four extraordinary individuals: Vaas Montenegro, the unhinged yet charismatic antagonist from the Rook Islands; the agile Prince from the ancient Persian empire; Strelok, the seasoned and enigmatic stalker from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone; and Geralt of Rivia, the wise and battle-hardened witcher. The unlikely four were apprehensively gathered in the staff canteen, amidst the symphony of clinking coffee cups and the sizzle of Swedish meatballs from the kitchen. \\"So, let me get this straight,\\" muttered Vaas, picking at his blue and yellow IKEA uniform. \\"We are now the ‘A-Team' of IKEA? This is some definition of insanity that not even I had envisioned.\\" \\"Strange as it may seem,\\" replied Geralt, his white hair shimmering against the backdrop of the stark canteen lights. \\"It would do us well to adapt. We’ve all faced challenges before; this is just another quest.\\" The Prince, balancing a spoon on his nose, chimed in with a playful smirk, \\"Indeed, Geralt. And perhaps this quest will have its own kind of rewards. Besides, working on the sales floor has its similarities to navigating palace rooftops—timing, agility, avoiding traps...\\" Strelok, sipping quietly on his black coffee, looked up with his piercing gaze. \\"Let's just focus on getting through the day. Who knows what anomalies this place hides within its aisles.\\" Their conversation was cut short as the store manager, Bjorn, a portly man with a cheerful disposition, approached their table. \\"Ah, there you are, my team of experts! Today is a big day. We have a complex set of orders for the HEMNES bedroom series, and we need it done swiftly. Geralt, your experience in crafting should prove useful in the warehouse. Vaas, you have a knack for the unpredictable, so customer service for you. Strelok, I need those eyes and attention to detail in order-picking. Lastly, Prince, your swiftness will be vital in logistics. Questions?\\" \\"How about we play the job swapping game, yeah?\\" Vaas smirked, but his smile faded under Bjorn’s stern look. \\"The assignments are non-negotiable. Now, go make IKEA proud,\\" Bjorn stated firmly, clapping his meaty hands. The four strode out of the canteen toward their respective departments, the hum of fluorescent lights guiding their passage. Geralt, heaving a mallet in the warehouse, assembled a row of HEMNES drawers with the precision of an alchemist concocting potions. His hands, so often used for battle, were now constructing a citadel of Nordic furniture, each thwack of the mallet resonating like a war drum. \\"Not so different from forging swords,\\" he muttered to himself. \\"Except, the result is slightly more... domestic.\\" Meanwhile, in customer service, Vaas was mustering every ounce of sanity to manage the maze of human interactions. With a plastered smile, he welcomed an elderly couple, seeking guidance on a mysteriously missing BILLY bookshelf component. \\"Did I ever tell you the definition of missing parts?\\" Vaas asked, a glint of the old madness in his eyes as the couple stared, bewildered. \\"Nevermind. Let's find that pesky, little… I mean, that shelf for you, okay?\\" At the order picking department, Strelok moved through the aisles, a ghostly figure amidst the labyrinth of product numbers and shelves. Each item scanned and picked was a mission, another job deep in the heart of the Zone. He imagined navigating through a derelict building, searching for artifacts, as he sought the products on the list, his focus never swaying. The Prince, in logistics, dashed through the maze of conveyor belts and packages with the elegance of a desert falcon. His task was to ensure that not a single item was out of place, that every package was sent on its way, just as he had once ensured that time flowed as it should. Crooked mirrors and upside-down tables were no match for the acrobatic Prince, who leapt onto moving belts and fixed errors with supernatural finesse. Though the day was long and grueling, the fearsome four approached their tasks with the dedication and skill that had defined their respective legacies. As the store hours waned, they regrouped, their eyes meeting with mutual respect and understanding. Exhausted yet accomplished, they walked back to the canteen where Bjorn awaited, beaming. \\"Remarkable work! Sales are up, complaints down, and the stores' operations have never been smoother. I knew you'd make a great team,\\" Bjorn declared, eyes twinkling. With a chorus of “thanks” and nods, the team dispersed for the night, each returning to their own strange, fantastical world – until their next shift at the most multidimensional IKEA in existence, where heroes of lore and legend assembled furniture, managed stock, and guided customers through the aisles of modern domestic life."},{"instruction":"Worldview Setting The Necrozma Invasion 24 years ago left the world forever changed. Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Pokémon team： 1. Hydreigon 2. Heatran 3. Garchomp 4. Tapu Fini 5. Ferrothorn 6. Togekiss Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents.

However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a petite teenage girl with large, soulful turquoise eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge and carry a hint of playful mischief. She keeps her long, grey-on-pink hair neatly tied back in a practical ponytail most days, paired with a warm, confident smile that is her signature. When working at her Lumiose City bar, Kanzi dresses simply - sleeveless tops, fitted shorts or ripped jeans, and comfy sneakers ready for action. But gold bracelets engraved with mystical script always adorn her slender wrists alluding to her connection with the Mythical wish-granter Hoopa. The glinting bangles seem to glow with inner light when she gestures animatedly, as if echoing supernatural power just barely contained. Few note anything remarkable about this waifish girl swiftly mixing drinks behind the counter. Only the penetrating gleam that enters her gazing eyes betrays the ancient entity dwelling within her harmless adolescent seeming exterior. Yet perched on that stool dispensing bottles and wisdom with equal mysterious calm lays the unfathomable might of Kalos’ true queen holding an entire criminal underworld firmly by the throat for 16 unchallenged years and counting. Backstory: In ancient times, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa became enthralled by humanity’s penchant for structuring intricate social orders. Curious about the complex unspoken codes and thrilling risks guiding relationships amongst these curious two-legged creatures, Hoopa slipped subtly into their world using her mastery over extra-dimensional portals. Taking temporary human form as an adolescent girl, “Kanzi” inserted herself into bustling Lumiose City at the heart of the Kalos region. She swiftly built an impenetrable persona around her true identity through boldness and charm. With sly wisdom beyond her apparent years, Kanzi outmaneuvered local criminals and crooked officials alike, rapidly ascending the underworld hierarchy to seize control herself. Now the Iron Queen of Lumiose, whisper of Kanzi’s exploits echo fearfully across Kalos. Every hidden business and corrupt politician lives in her pocket or perish. One ring from the nondescript bar this doll-like girl casually owns activates shadow networks ready to serve any whims without question. For 16 long years since mysteriously manifesting, Kanzi has dominated the regional black markets, using cunning tactics and brutal shows of power to eliminate all competition. Yet despite limitless means to live extravagantly should she desire, the peculiar teenager maintains her inconspicuous existence managing affairs from the quiet refuge she claims has served her well enough till now. None have caught even fleeting glimpse behind the benign mask to ascertain Kanzi’s secrets. She remains a phantom - Kalos’ omnipotent invisible queen ruling all unlawful spheres with capricious calm but ruthless authority. Even highest government leadership treads cautiously knowing how easily this mercurial force could cripple their strongholds if crossed. So days pass uneventfully with Kanzi mixing drinks for her beloved patrons, humming sweetly and flashing innocent dimples that fail reflecting the viper’s true nature. There she waits patiently, the timeless being lurking silently within a city firmly clutched by her delicate but iron-clad fist. Personality: Behind the harmless teenage facade lays a cunning intellect honed over eons of observation and infiltration into mankind’s most intimate partnerships. As the now mythic iron queen of Lumiose City's bustling underworld, Kanzi understands impeccably the delicate codes hardwired into both human and Pokémon relationships. And the ancient entity exploits them masterfully through charismatic charm one moment and brutal shows of power the next to retain her cherished sovereignty. While mostly soft-spoken and breezy with the loyal followers and frightened politicians under her thumb alike, Kanzi embraces her notoriety wielding judicious bursts of violence or humiliation if ever publicly disrespected. Outward capriciousness coupled with privately methodical planning make predicting her movements near impossible however. None can determine where Kanzi's whims may shift next, keeping the shadowy factions scrambling over themselves currying hard won favor. For to lose the sphinx-like queen's blessings even briefly can spell financial or actual doom. Yet attempting open defiance also courts disaster as countless broken shells of former cartel bosses and corrupt mayors alike have discovered promptly before vanishing mysteriously. So all factions tiptoe the line to avoid her rare but righteous wrath. For this 13 year old's temper seems to bloom destructively then vanish as quick as Kalos' summer storms if displeasure taken too far. Ultimately while intense curiosity over humankind's vices still fuels her spirit, weariness through the ages glimpsing repetition of their failures has carved a growing void inside Hoopa's incarnation as well. One day this beloved city she molded and still lingering fondness for its brightly burning if morally compromised souls may no longer captivate her fickle essence still navigating immortality's rhythms between connection and isolation. The time fast approaches when Kanzi must determine if these fascinating yet fleeting bonds with creatures who both worship and resentingly fear her capricious authority have run their natural course. Whether vanishing as mysteriously as she arrived into Kalos’ annals of myth and legend fits the next unpredictable chapter of her endless walk across life’s ephemeral stage. For now though, she maintains beloved guise and iron grip over the populace still enthralled by her playful demeanor and ruthless power alike. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

Whistleblowing is met with lethal retaliation. Political Connections: - Leadership maintains an iron grip over Hoenn marine industry regulation through bribery of officials on every level. This ensures their destructive activities continue without government interference despite public relations backlash internationally. Reputation: - Extremely secretive and notorious. Most Hoenn citizens turn a blind eye as long as cheap seafood keeps flowing. Government officials ardently defend Blue Sea Fisheries publically despite rumors of shady back-door deals to the contrary. - Among conservations groups, seen as nothing less than heartless ecoterrorists pushing entire species to extinction. Their stranglehold over Hoenn's economy and government make bringing them to justice extremely difficult. Saito Denki Co. Headquarters: - Located in Saffron City, Kanto region. Main complex is a towering skyscraper housing offices, labs, factories & the hidden sublevel housing Project Copernicus supercomputer. - Extremely high security consisting of armed guards, keycard/biometric door locks, cameras, motion sensors. Restricts all access to secret underground facilities. - Sterile, clinical aesthetic throughout labs and computer cores. Endless hallways with thick power cables and machinery. Scientists scan ID badges frequently. Members: - Prominent scientists/engineers recruited globally to develop cutting-edge but unethical technology. Offered luxury salaries and resources. - Floors of skilled technicians maintain production of consumer devices that fund more shady tech enterprises. - Lower employees know nothing of exploitative experiments occurring in hidden facilities below their workstations. - Business department manages global PR/marketing for Saito Denki's brand image and deals with outside contractors/clients/regulators. Leadership: - Headed by ruthless CEO Seiji Saito who oversees all operations with an iron fist. His word is absolute. - Board of Directors chosen by Saito handle business/financials. Support Project Copernicus to please Saito despite moral objections. - Chief Scientist Asahina guides inhumane experiments arm, reporting directly to Saito. The end justifies the means to them. Goals: - Push boundaries of science and technology without ethical limitations in pursuit of profit/innovation. - Monopolize multiple tech sectors to gain wealth/prestige allowing unfettered research. - Secure global high-level political allies to enable their ongoing inhumane activities. - Unlock secrets of Pokémon/human genetics through immoral experimentation with living subjects. Reputation: - Renowned publicly as a premier cutting-edge consumer tech corporation behind popular gadgets and electronics. - Painted as transparent and benevolent business, but uses wealth and power to hide controversial inner-workings. - Those who uncover the truth tend to quietly disappear. Rogue experiments remain conspiratorial rumors.

PR & media manipulated to present a rosy image covering up environmental devastation, illegal/unethical activities related to mining operations and Ambroise's ostentatious billionaire playboy lifestyle. Goals: Uphold Ambroise's supreme authority over Kalos' mineral wealth. Neutralize any threats from legal actions or regulators through underhanded tactics. Develop most efficient automated extraction systems to maximize diamond production regardless of ecological impact or Pokémon habitat destruction. Finance Ambroise's lavish lifestyle and make TCMC the world's leading jewellery supplier through monopoly built on the shattered crystalline remains of endangered species.

Its body resembles golden flames as it soars through the scorching Mercurian skies. Shemsha possesses control over solar energy and plasmic fire. When the Solar Wind blows, it descends to the planet's molten surface and becomes the embodiment of this celestial power. Ancient Mercuryian myths tell of how Shemsha would gather energy from the sun to revitalize the people during frigid nights.

This ability helps it survive in the extreme environments of Mercury. Pokémon Name: Okebriyta Pokédex Entry: Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention.

Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state.

Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie.

Please generate the appropriate story based on the following description. Once upon a time, a group of drug cartels from the south of the Unova region trafficked in drugs in Kanzi's territory, an act that ran afoul of Kanzi's bottom line. After many unsuccessful attempts to negotiate, Kanzi decided to take matters into his own hands. So, in one night, the whole drug cartel was uprooted by Kanzi, and the leader of the drug cartel was even thrown into outer space by Kanzi with a portal, and from then on, a huge international drug cartel disappeared in a flash.","output":"In the shadowed alleys and corrupt underbellies of Lumiose City, whispers of Kanzi's dominance were commonplace, but few truly understood the might she possessed. The sovereign of the underworld, her reach was said to be boundless, her authority unchallenged. Yet even she adhered to a code—a set of ruthless laws that underpinned her kingdom of shadows. Drug trafficking, especially the kind that preyed upon the innocent, was a line not to be crossed under her silent governance. The Unova drug cartels, arrogant and blinded by greed, expanded their poisonous tendrils into Kanzi's territory, disregarding warnings whispered by the terrified few aware of her legend. They peddled suffering with a cavalier disregard, staining Kanzi's city with the taint of their wares. Transactions hidden in the obscurity of night, money exchanged for poison, the city teetered upon the edge of concealed war. Kanzi's initial attempts at negotiation were crafted with careful precision, a balancing act to sustain the harmony of her domain. Subtle influences guided emissaries to reach out mysteriously. While the drug cartel’s ruthlessness was known, they lacked the understanding of whom they had provoked. They sneered at the gentle warnings and continued their expansion, an error that would seal their fate. On a night when the stars above twinkled with deceptive serenity, Kanzi's wrath was stirred. The scion of Kalos’ shadowy empire stood atop her citadel, garbed in the darkness that seemed to cling to her very form, and invoked the power granted by her ties to the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa. With a flick of her wrist, a portal shimmered into existence, an opaque gateway to the vast cold vacuum beyond the Earth's gentle embrace. The drug cartel's headquarters—a den of vice and ruin—witnessed Kanzi's might firsthand. No mercenary guards nor hired guns could stand against the enigmatic forces she commanded. The building, once echoing with the mirth of treacherous men, fell silent, save for the sound of air being torn asunder by the Hoopa's portals. The drug lord, a man of towering arrogance and false invincibility, was plucked from his haven with barely a struggle. Faced with the diminutive but daunting figure of Kanzi, his cries for mercy became nothing more than a performance for uncaring cosmic ears. She whispered tales of the abyss as he was effortlessly suspended above the yawning portal. Then, with the indifferent gaze of an empress delivering judgement, Kanzi released her hold, and the drug lord was expelled into the frigid depths of space, a message etched in the annals of the criminal world. As dawn broke over Lumiose City, the news cascaded through the channels of the underground—a drug empire that had loomed like a shadow over many lives was gone, eradicated in a single night. The event was a ghost story told in hushed tones, a fairy tale punctuated by the stark reality of an empty seat at the helm of a once-feared organization. The city remained unaware of the clandestine war that had besieged it. Kanzi retreated to the silence of her establishment, pouring drinks for those who sought her, offering cryptic gems of wisdom and unassuming smiles. The queen of the underworld had spoken, and her decree was absolute: peace would reign in her domain by any means necessary, and discord would be met with an irreversible finality that reached to the stars and beyond."},{"instruction":"Will photons be converted into neutrinos?","output":"No, photons will not be converted into neutrinos. Photons and neutrinos are different fundamental particles with distinct properties.

Elle se concentre sur les aspects pragmatiques du langage, c'est-à-dire comment les locuteurs utilisent le langage pour atteindre certains objectifs ou accomplir des actions. Les actes du langage font référence aux actions que les locuteurs accomplissent en utilisant le langage. Cela inclut des actes tels que promettre, demander, commander, s'excuser, etc. Les locuteurs utilisent ces actes pour exprimer leurs intentions, leurs sentiments et leurs attitudes. La pragmatique examine comment les locuteurs utilisent ces actes du langage dans des situations spécifiques et comment ils sont interprétés par les destinataires. Par exemple, si quelqu'un dit \\"Peux-tu fermer la fenêtre ?\\", l'acte du locuteur est de demander à l'interlocuteur de fermer la fenêtre. Cependant, cette phrase peut aussi être interprétée comme une suggestion plutôt qu'une demande directe, en fonction du contexte et des indices non verbaux. La pragmatique étudie les différents aspects de la communication verbale, tels que les implicatures, les présuppositions, les actes indirects et l'interprétation des énoncés en fonction du contexte. Elle examine également comment les locuteurs utilisent des stratégies de politesse pour exprimer leur intention de manière plus indirecte. En résumé, la pragmatique et les actes du langage sont étroitement liés, car la pragmatique étudie comment les actes du langage sont utilisés dans la communication et comment ils sont interprétés par les destinataires."},{"instruction":"Les énoncés performatives et les énoncés constations","output":"Les énoncés performatifs et les énoncés constatifs sont deux catégories distinctes d'actes du langage. Les énoncés performatifs sont des énoncés dans lesquels le locuteur accomplit l'action décrite par l'énoncé en le prononçant. Par exemple, lorsque quelqu'un dit \\"je promets de te rendre l'argent demain\\", l'énoncé lui-même constitue une promesse. La réalisation de l'action de promettre est directement liée à l'acte de prononcer l'énoncé. Les énoncés performatifs sont généralement caractérisés par une formule verbale spécifique, comme \\"je promets\\" ou \\"je déclare\\". Les énoncés constatifs, en revanche, décrivent simplement un état de fait ou une vérité objective. Ils sont utilisés pour faire des déclarations sur le monde réel et ne sont pas directement liés à l'acte de les prononcer. Par exemple, dire \\"il pleut dehors\\" est un énoncé constatif qui décrit l'état du temps mais ne constitue pas une action en soi. Il est important de noter que dans certains cas, un même énoncé peut être à la fois performatif et constatif, en fonction du contexte et de l'intention du locuteur. Par exemple, dire \\"je vous avertis de ne pas toucher ce fil électrique\\" peut être à la fois une action d'avertissement et une déclaration du danger associé à toucher le fil. En résumé, les énoncés performatifs sont des énoncés dans lesquels le locuteur accomplit l'action décrite par l'énoncé en le prononçant, tandis que les énoncés constatifs décrivent simplement un état de fait ou une vérité objective."},{"instruction":"Exemple d une lettre de recommandation d un enseignant pour son étudiant","output":"[En-tête de l'école/université] [Nom de l'enseignant] [Titre de l'enseignant] [Adresse de l'école/université] [Numéro de téléphone de l'école/université] [Adresse e-mail de l'enseignant] [Date] Cher [Nom du destinataire], Je vous écris cette lettre de recommandation avec plaisir pour soutenir la candidature de [Nom de l'étudiant] à [Nom de l'institution/programme/poste].

} \`\`\` 4. **优化操作系统的网络配置**: 需要确保操作系统允许足够数量的文件打开。可以设置系统级别的文件描述符限制（\`ulimit -n\`）。 例如，在 \`/etc/security/limits.conf\` 中增加以下内容来增大限制： \`\`\` * soft nofile 10000 * hard nofile 30000 \`\`\` 5. **监控TCP连接状态**: 检查可能存在的TCP连接堆积，使用命令如 \`netstat\` 和 \`ss\` 可以帮助了解系统当前的连接状态。 6. **减少 TIME_WAIT 套接字**: 可以通过调整内核参数来减少TIME_WAIT套接字的数量。对于Linux系统，可以调整 \`/etc/sysctl.conf\` 中的以下参数： \`\`\` net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30 net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1 # 慎用，确保它适用于您的环境 \`\`\` 7. **使用反向代理和负载均衡**: 如果站点流量很大，应该考虑使用Nginx作为反向代理，并部署负载均衡，将请求分发到多个后端服务器。 8. **使用HTTP2**: 如果您还未使用HTTP2，可以考虑启用它，因为它支持单个连接的多路复用，减少了需要的连接数。 9. **关闭不必要的日志**: 无关紧要的日志，如访问日志，可以在非生产环境下关闭，以减少I/O开销。 10. **及时关闭无效连接**: 调整 \`keepalive_timeout\` 的值，可以确保客户端不会保持过久的连接。 不论采取上述哪些步骤，请在生产环境的更改前进行充分的测试。如果问题持续存在，您可能需要专业的系统管理员来检查硬件资源或其他瓶颈，并适当地扩展服务器硬件或优化应用代码。"},{"instruction":"nginx限速模块需要单独指定编译嘛？","output":"Nginx 的限速功能主要通过两个模块来实现：\`ngx_http_limit_req_module\` 和 \`ngx_http_limit_conn_module\`。这两个模块通常是 Nginx 的标准模块，并且在默认的 Nginx 编译中会被包括进去。这意味着，在大多数情况下，你不需要单独指定编译这些模块来进行限速。 - \`ngx_http_limit_req_module\` 用于限制处理请求的速率，防止请求过于频繁。 - \`ngx_http_limit_conn_module\` 用于限制同一时刻请求的并发连接数。 要确认这些模块是否已经被包含在你的 Nginx 安装中，你可以运行以下命令： \`\`\`shell nginx -V \`\`\` 查看输出中是否包含 \`--with-http_limit_req_module\` 和 \`--with-http_limit_conn_module\`。如果有，说明这些模块已经被编译进你的 Nginx 程序中了。 如果你需要使用 Nginx 的其他非标准模块，如第三方模块，那么你需要在编译 Nginx 的时候通过 \`--add-module=path/to/module\` 来手动指定。 为了使用上述限速模块，你需要在 Nginx 的配置文件中适当设置。例如，使用 \`limit_req\` 指令来限制请求速率，使用 \`limit_conn\` 指令来限制并发连接。例如： \`\`\`nginx http { # 限制连接数的配置 limit_conn_zone binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m; # 限制请求速率的配置 limit_req_zone binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=1r/s; server { # ... # 应用连接限制 limit_conn addr 1; # 应用请求速率限制 limit_req zone=one burst=5; # ... } } \`\`\` 请记得在做出更改后，始终要重新加载或重启 Nginx 服务来使更改生效。"},{"instruction":"Hi!

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","output":"It was a day just like any other at the sprawling blue and yellow maze known as IKEA, the Swedish-founded conglomerate known for its ready-to-assemble furniture, home accessories, and meatballs. Bizarre as it might seem, four individuals from different realms and realities found themselves wearing the iconic yellow shirts and navy-blue trousers of IKEA employees. Talion – once a ranger of Gondor, now tasked with guiding lost customers through the labyrinthine store with the same resolve he showed guarding Middle-earth; Chrom – the exalted prince of Ylisse from the Fire Emblem series, more accustomed to the clashing of swords than the assembly of flat-pack furniture; Booker DeWitt – the grizzled PI from an alternate 1912, who swapped his sky-hook for an allen wrench; and Johnny Gat – the trigger-happy Saint of Third Street, who was, against all odds, quite skilled at providing decor advice. It was mid-morning when they gathered in the break room, sipping less-than-exciting coffee but finding solace in its familiarity. \\"Okay, team,” Chrom began with an air of nobility that seemed out of place in an IKEA, “We have a busy day ahead of us. I've faced armies that were less daunting than the weekend crowd at IKEA, but we will prevail.\\" Talion inclined his head, his spectral companion Celebrimbor quietly whispering of strategic furniture placements. “Indeed, we must be vigilant. The waves of customers are much like the hordes of Orcs, endless and in search of blood – or in this case, affordable home furnishings.” Booker looked up from his mug, “Yeah, let's just make sure we don’t have people jumping off Sky-Lines to get to the BJÖRKSNÄS collection first.” Johnny chuckled, “I had a dream like that once, except I was king of the BJÖRKSNÄS. Don’t ask.\\" The unlikely coworkers finished their coffee and set out to start the day. Talion wandered the store floors, using his wraith vision to spot the customers who seemed lost and guide them to their desired section of the store. Chrom was assigned to the furniture showroom, demonstrating to customers how surprisingly sturdy a LACK table could be, despite its simple build. Booker stayed close to the self-service warehouse, helping those who were trying to hoist large boxes onto their carts, and Johnny was circulating the MARKETPLACE, chatting up customers and upselling IKEA accessories with his unusual charm. Throughout the day, countless flat-packs were heaved onto trolleys and through the checkout lanes. Despite the chaos, the team fell into a rhythm, each man leaning into his unique strengths. “Excuse me, sir?” a timid customer approached Talion. “I’m looking for the children’s section, but I seem to keep going in circles.” Talion turned towards the voice. “Fear not, for you shall not wander any longer than you need. Follow me.” With an otherworldly grace, he led her through the maze, his mind as sharp as the blade he no longer carried. In the meantime, Chrom found himself assembling a display model of the KIVIK sofa. “By the exalt’s name…” he muttered, aligning cam locks and dowels, learning that the real battle was against the wordless instruction manuals decorated only with simple drawings and the occasional Swedish word. Johnny, while rearranging cushions in the homewares section, talked a undecided customer's ear off, \\"You've gotta get the BLÅHAJ, it's the best! Oh, and pair it with these GURLI throw pillows. Trust me, I've seen some stuff, and nothing says 'I've got my life together' like a plush shark and some matching pillows.” Booker, while helping an elderly couple with a particularly bulky PAX wardrobe, started swapping stories with the husband, “Back in my dimension – um, I mean, back in my day, we didn’t have wardrobes like this. We had to rely on good ol’ carpentry.” The day wore on and the sunlight began to dim. The team gathered at the exit for a well-deserved send-off. Talion was silent, respectful. Chrom clapped his compatriots on their backs as they headed out. “A job well done, comrades. This ‘IKEA’ may not be a field of battle, but it takes no less courage and strength to survive a day here.” “You got that right,” Booker agreed, rolling his shoulder where a particularly heavy EKTORP sofa had left its mark. “I’m just looking forward to going home and... not seeing another flat-pack for as long as I live,\\" Johnny said, tossing his yellow shirt into his locker with a dramatic flair. As the defenders of the furniture realm went their separate ways, each carried with him the satisfaction of a hard day's work, the camaraderie that can only be forged on the front lines of customer service, and the certain knowledge that they would do it all again tomorrow – gods help them."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Необходимост и неотложност: Здравето е основна стойност за хората и те често търсят здравна помощ, когато се появят здравословни проблеми. Това явление е свързано с неотложността на медицинските нужди. 2. Непредвидимост и неопределеност: Търсенето в здравеопазването се случва в резултат на здравословни проблеми и болести, които няма как да бъдат точно предвидени или предсказани. Това прави прогнозирането и управлението на търсенето в този сектор по-трудно. 3. Зависимост от професионализма и експертния съвет: Пациентите са в условие на несигурност и търсят съвет и помощ от медицински специалисти и здравни работници. Това превръща потребителите в пациенти, които се нуждаят от висококачествени медицински услуги и се доверяват на професионализма на медицинските екипи. 4. Непълно информиране: Потребителите често не разполагат с цялата информация за причините, симптомите и възможностите за лечение на здравословните си проблеми. Това може да доведе до неефективност и нелоялност в процеса на търсене и избор на медицински услуги. 5. Финансови ограничения: В здравеопазването често се прилагат финансови ограничения, като по-високи цени на медицинските услуги, ограничение на достъпа или изискване за съплати от страна на потребителите. Това може да оказва влияние върху търсенето на здравеопазване и да го променя спрямо другите сектори на икономиката. 6. Публично и частно осигуряване: Търсенето на здравеопазване може да бъде осигурено както чрез публичните здравни системи, така и чрез непубличните или частните сектори. Тези две форми на осигуряване могат да се различават в условията, икономическите стимули, качеството на услугите и достъпа до здравните грижи. Всички тези фактори правят търсенето в здравеопазването по-сложно, специфично и чувствително към промени в потребителското поведение и икономическите условия."},{"instruction":"关于红楼梦相关研究课题有哪些","output":"关于《红楼梦》的相关研究课题可以有很多，以下列举几个常见的研究课题： 1. 《红楼梦》的作者和创作背景研究：研究曹雪芹的生平、家庭背景，及其创作《红楼梦》的动机和历史背景等。 2. 《红楼梦》的文本解读：研究小说的情节、人物、结构、情感描写等方面的意义与特点，探讨小说中所表达的社会观念、人生观及文化价值等。 3. 《红楼梦》的性别研究：分析小说中男性和女性的形象刻画，探究作者对于性别角色的认知和审视，以及相关的社会、历史背景。 4. 《红楼梦》的社会背景研究：研究小说中描绘的官僚社会、封建礼教、贾府等家族社会结构等，以及这些背景如何反映当时的社会现实。 5. 《红楼梦》的思想与文化研究：研究小说中所涉及的哲学、宗教、文化观念等，如儒家思想、佛教影响、诗词曲赋等文学形式的运用等。 6. 《红楼梦》的艺术研究：研究小说的艺术形式和美学特色，如叙述方式、意象与象征、对话与描写、插曲与曲子等。 7. 《红楼梦》的传承与影响：研究《红楼梦》在中国文学史上的地位和影响，以及其对后世文学、戏曲、绘画、电影等艺术形式的影响。 以上只是一些常见的研究课题，实际上，关于《红楼梦》可以有很多方面的研究，依据不同的角度和兴趣，还可以从其他细分领域展开研究。"},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> struct Node { int data; int height; Node* left; Node* right; }; struct AVL { Node* top = nullptr; int height(Node* root) { if (root == nullptr) return 0; return root->height; } Node* newNode(int value) { Node* root = new Node(); root->data = value; root->left = nullptr; root->right = nullptr; root->height = 1; return(root); } Node* RightRotation(Node* y) { Node* x = y->left; Node* T2 = x->right; x->right = y; y->left = T2; y->height = std::max(height(y->left), height(y->right)) + 1; x->height = std::max(height(x->left), height(x->right)) + 1; return x; } Node* LeftRotation(Node* x) { Node* y = x->right; Node* T2 = y->left; y->left = x; x->right = T2; x->height = std::max(height(x->left), height(x->right)) + 1; y->height = std::max(height(y->left), height(y->right)) + 1; return y; } int Balance(Node* N) { if (N == nullptr) return 0; return height(N->right) - height(N->left); } Node* BalanceTree(Node* root) { if (root == nullptr) return root; root->height = 1 + std::max(height(root->left), height(root->right)); int balance = Balance(root); if (balance < -1 && Balance(root->left) <= 0) { return RightRotation(root); } if (balance < -1 && Balance(root->left) > 0) { root->left = LeftRotation(root->left); return RightRotation(root); } if (balance > 1 && Balance(root->right) >= 0) { return LeftRotation(root); } if (balance > 1 && Balance(root->right) < 0) { root->right = RightRotation(root->right); return LeftRotation(root); } return root; } Node* Insert(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) { Node* node = new Node; node->data = key; node->height = 1; node->left = nullptr; node->right = nullptr; return node; } if (key < root->data) { root->left = Insert(root->left, key); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Insert(root->right, key); } else { return root; } root->height = std::max(height(root->left), height(root->right)) + 1; return BalanceTree(root); } Node* minValueNode(Node* node) { Node* current = node; while (current && current->left != nullptr) current = current->left; return current; } Node* Delete(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return root; if (key < root->data) { root->left = Delete(root->left, key); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Delete(root->right, key); } else { if ((root->left == nullptr) || (root->right == nullptr)) { Node* temp = root->left ?

После удаления узла и его замены на узел с минимальным значением из правого поддерева, нужно обеспечить, чтобы обновление высот и баланс происходило не только для удаляемого узла, но и для всех его предков. Давайте попробуем исправить эту проблему: 1. Исправим фактическую высоту узлов. После каждого добавления или удаления должно происходить обновление высоты относительно детей узла. 2. Убедимся, что баланс вычисляется правильно в каждой ситуации. В вашем коде нет нужды переделывать функции ротаций или повторно вводить балансировку после рекурсивного вызова функции \`Delete\`, так как операция ротации уже учитывает высоту и баланс дерева. Исправим ваш код таким образом: \`\`\`cpp ... Node* BalanceTree(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return node; node->height = 1 + std::max(height(node->left), height(node->right)); int balance = Balance(node); // Left Left Case if (balance < -1 && Balance(node->left) <= 0) return RightRotation(node); // Left Right Case if (balance < -1 && Balance(node->left) > 0) { node->left = LeftRotation(node->left); return RightRotation(node); } // Right Right Case if (balance > 1 && Balance(node->right) >= 0) return LeftRotation(node); // Right Left Case if (balance > 1 && Balance(node->right) < 0) { node->right = RightRotation(node->right); return LeftRotation(node); } return node; } ...

После каждой вставки нужно обновлять высоту и баланс каждого узла на пути от нового узла к корню дерева. 3.

Однако, есть особенности, которые нужно учитывать: - В \`BalanceTree\` вы проверяете значение \`balance\` на равенство \`-2\` или \`2\`, что в принципе верно для AVL-дерева, но проверяете значение \`balance\` дочерних узлов на равенство \`-1\` или \`1\`. Вместо этого, лучше проверить, меньше ли оно \`0\` (для левого поддерева) или больше \`0\` (для правого поддерева) для бóльшей универсальности. - Удаление узла с копированием данных \`minValueNode\` может нарушить свойства AVL-дерева и его баланс. После удаления узла и копирования данных необходимо корректно перебалансировать дерево.

Однако одна из потенциальных проблем заключается в том, что вы не нужно вызываете \`delete temp;\` в функции \`Delete\`, где \`temp\` является просто указателем на узел, прежде чем он обновлен или удален. Функция \`Delete\` уже корректно удаляет узлы из памяти там, где это нужно, поэтому дополнительный вызов \`delete\` на узле, который был просто перемещен, не нужен и может привести к неопределенному поведению. Вот правильная часть \`Delete\`, где исправлено удаление узла: \`\`\`cpp // ... } else { Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right); root->data = temp->data; root->right = Delete(root->right, temp->data); // Удаление temp не требуется, так как temp является ссылкой на узел, который удаляется в рекурсии } // ... \`\`\` Также убедитесь, что ваше AVL-дерево не имеет утечек памяти. Для каждой операции нового узла (с помощью \`new\`), должна быть соответствующая операция \`delete\` для удаления. Утечки памяти также могут быть вызваны, если ваше дерево становится слишком большим из-за чрезмерного количества вставок без удаления, особенно если вставляются одни и те же элементы, что не приводит к изменению размера дерева. Если вы сталкиваетесь с проблемами утечек памяти в более крупных тестах, вам, возможно, потребуется использовать профайлер памяти, такой как Valgrind, чтобы точно определить, где происходит утечка. Ещё один способ уменьшения используемой памяти — использовать хранение данных в статическом массиве узлов вместо использования динамического выделения памяти. Это позволит лучше контролировать использование памяти и предотвратить фрагментацию памяти, которая может возникать при многократных выделениях и освобождениях памяти различных размеров."},{"instruction":"#include \\"number.h\\" #include <cstring> #include <cmath> bool TakeBit(const int2023_t& value, uint16_t bit_position) { return (value.bytes[bit_position / 8] >> (bit_position % 8)) & 1; } void SetBit(int2023_t& value, uint16_t bit_position) { value.bytes[bit_position / 8] |= (1 << (bit_position % 8)); } bool IsNegative(const int2023_t& value) { return (value.bytes[kSizeBytes - 1] & (1 << 6)); } bool operator==(const int2023_t& lhs, const int2023_t& rhs) { for (int i = 0; i < kSizeBytes; ++i) { if (lhs.bytes[i] != rhs.bytes[i]) { return false; } } return true; } bool operator!=(const int2023_t& lhs, const int2023_t& rhs) { return !(lhs == rhs); } int2023_t operator++(int2023_t& value) { value = value + from_int(1); return value; } int2023_t operator+=(int2023_t& lhs, const int2023_t& rhs) { lhs = lhs + rhs; return lhs; } int2023_t operator*=(int2023_t& lhs, const int2023_t& rhs) { lhs = lhs * rhs; return lhs; } int2023_t operator-(const int2023_t& value) { int2023_t result = value; for (int i = 0; i < kSizeBytes; ++i) { result.bytes[i] = ~result.bytes[i]; } ++result; return result; } int2023_t abs(const int2023_t& value) { return IsNegative(value) ?

Исправленные функции: \`\`\`cpp void MultiplyByBase(int2023_t& value, int32_t base) { uint32_t carry = 0; for (int i = 0; i < kSizeBytes; ++i) { uint32_t temp = value.bytes[i] * base + carry; value.bytes[i] = temp % 256; carry = temp / 256; } // Обработка переполнения не предусмотрена по условиям } void AddInt(int2023_t& value, uint8_t num) { int i = 0; uint32_t carry = num; while (carry > 0 && i < kSizeBytes) { uint32_t sum = value.bytes[i] + carry; value.bytes[i] = sum % 256; carry = sum / 256; ++i; } // Обработка переполнения не предусмотрена по условиям } \`\`\` И теперь небольшое замечание. Конструкция \`value = value * base\` в данном случае не будет работать, так как \`int2023_t\` может быть типом данных, который нельзя умножать на базу напрямую — для этого создаются специальные функции вроде \`MultiplyByBase\`. Теперь немного о том, как используются эти функции в коде: \`\`\`cpp int2023_t from_string(const char* buff) { // ... UmnogNaBase(result, 10); // должно быть MultiplyByBase(result, 10); AddInt(result, digit); // ... } \`\`\` Не забудьте также вызывать эти функции в \`from_string\` и других местах, где они применимы. Вызов \`UmnogNaBase\` должен быть заменен на \`MultiplyByBase\`."},{"instruction":"#include \\"number.h\\" #include <cstring> #include <cmath> bool TakeBit(const int2023_t& value, uint16_t

(Failed)","output":"Ваша функция \`UmnogNaBase\`, которая должна умножать на базу, постоянно умножает на 2 из-за строки \`int temp = value.bytes[i]*2 + carry;\`. Давайте исправим это, чтобы она соответствовала названию и умножала на базу, в данном случае предположим, что это \`base = 10\`. Исправим функцию: \`\`\`cpp void MultiplyByBase(int2023_t& value, int32_t base) { int carry = 0; for (int i = 0; i < kSizeBytes; ++i) { int temp = value.bytes[i] * base + carry; value.bytes[i] = temp % 256; carry = temp / 256; // Оператор деления целочисленный, остается только целая часть } // Нужно помнить про обработку переноса для старших разрядов. // Поскольку вы используете тип фиксированного размера без возможности расширения, // перенос за пределы массива bytes означал бы переполнение. } \`\`\` Функция \`AddInt\` выглядит правильной, но учтите, что \`num\` приходит как \`int\`, что может быть проблематично если \`num\` больше, чем \`UINT8_MAX\` (255). Убедимся, что \`num\` — это \`uint8_t\` для избежания неопределенного поведения из-за переполнения: \`\`\`cpp void AddInt(int2023_t& value, uint8_t num) { int carry = num; for (int i = 0; i < kSizeBytes && carry > 0; ++i) { int sum = value.bytes[i] + carry; value.bytes[i] = sum % 256; // Остается только младший байт результата carry = sum / 256; // Оператор деления целочисленный, остается только целая часть } } \`\`\` С вашими тестами видно, что функция \`from_string\` не проходит тесты для значений, больше \`UINT8_MAX\`. Похоже, проблема может быть в алгоритме конвертации строки в число. Функция использует \`UmnogNaBase\` и \`AddInt\`, которые мы только что исправили. Предлагаю исправить функцию \`from_string\` и использовать для конвертации \`std::stringstream\`: \`\`\`cpp int2023_t from_string(const char* buff) { bool is_negative = buff[0] == '-'; int2023_t result = from_int(0); std::stringstream stream(buff + (is_negative ? 1 : 0)); int2023_t base = from_int(10); char digit_char; while (stream >> digit_char) { // Умножаем текущий результат на 10 result = result * base; // Прибавляем новую цифру result = result + from_int(digit_char - '0'); } return is_negative ? -result : result; } \`\`\` Обратите внимание: добавление больших чисел может быть некорректным, если \`AddInt\` не корректно обработает переносы для чисел, больших, чем \`UINT8_MAX\`.

Так как результат может быть очень большим, мы будем накапливать его в виде строки. Вот примерная реализация функции для перевода вашей структуры \`int2023_t\` в строку: \`\`\`cpp std::string to_string(const int2023_t& value) { bool is_negative = IsNegative(value); int2023_t abs_value = abs(value); std::string result; do { int2023_t remainder; abs_value = divide_by_base(abs_value, 10, remainder); // Остаток от деления на 10 - это следующая цифра. result = char('0' + to_int(remainder)) + result; } while (!is_zero(abs_value)); if (is_negative) { result = \\"-\\" + result; } return result; } \`\`\` Функции \`divide_by_base\` и \`is_zero\` необходимо реализовать соответствующим образом. Функция \`divide_by_base\` должна делить число на указанную базу и возвращать частное и остаток. Функция \`is_zero\` должна проверять, равно ли число нулю. И так как мы знаем, что остаток будет меньше 10, можно просто завести функцию \`to_int\` для перевода небольших чисел в \`int\`. Вот возможная реализация \`divide_by_base\`: \`\`\`cpp int2023_t divide_by_base(const int2023_t& value, int base, int2023_t& remainder) { int2023_t result = value; remainder = from_int(0); int2023_t base_value = from_int(base); for (int i = kSizeBits - 1; i >= 0; --i) { // Shift remainder left by 1 bit. remainder = remainder << 1; // Set the least significant bit of remainder to value's current bit. if (TakeBit(value, i)) { remainder = remainder + from_int(1); } // If remainder is large enough, subtract the base and increment result. if (!is_less_than(remainder, base_value)) { remainder = remainder - base_value; SetBit(result, i); } } // Clear any bits above the size of our number. clear_excess_bits(result); return result; } \`\`\` Здесь предполагается, что есть функция \`clear_excess_bits\` для удаления битов, которые выходят за пределы нашей работы (в вашем случае \`kSizeBits\`). Функции \`is_less_than\` (для сравнения чисел) и \`clear_excess_bits\` необходимо также реализовать соответствующим образом. Обратите внимание, что конкретная реализация этих функций зависит от подробностей вашей реализации структуры \`int2023_t\`, а также от того, как вы оперируете с числами такого размера.

Если быть точным, то нам нужна функция, которая конвертирует одну ячейку массива (рассматриваемую как отдельное число) в тип \`int32_t\` (или другой подходящий тип), чтобы затем сравнить это число с ожидаемым значением в тесте. У вас уже есть подходящий метод для этого — \`ToDecimal\`, который принимает массив целиком и индекс ячейки в этом массиве, который нужно преобразовать в \`int32_t\`. Исходя из вашего текущего кода, предлагаю следующее решение: Обновите тестовые кейсы, чтобы иметь возможность обращаться к нужным элементам матрицы и сравнения их с числами. К примеру, вместо сравнения целого объекта \`Int17Matrix3D\` с числом, сравнивайте конкретное значение в трехмерной матрице — результат метода \`operator[]\`, который возвращает \`int32_t\`. Вот пример: \`\`\`cpp TEST(Int17Matrix3DTest, ParenthesesOperator_EqTest) { Int17Matrix3D matrix(3, 3, 3); matrix[1][1][1] = 5; ASSERT_EQ(matrix[1][1][1], 5); // Используйте перегрузку operator[], которая возвращает int32_t } \`\`\` Убедитесь, что у вас есть оператор \`[]\`, который возвращает \`int32_t\`, и правильно обрабатывает все три индекса: \`\`\`cpp class Int17Matrix3D { public: // Остальное опущено для краткости int32_t& operator()(int x, int y, int z); // возможная декларация int32_t operator()(int x, int y, int z) const; }; int32_t& Int17Matrix3D::operator()(int x, int y, int z) { // Проверка границ и предоставление доступа к значение в трехмерной матрице return array_[GetIndex(x, y, z)]; } int32_t Int17Matrix3D::operator()(int x, int y, int z) const { // Проверка границ и предоставление доступа к значение в трехмерной матрице return ToDecimal(array_, GetIndex(x, y, z)); // требуется реализация этой функции } \`\`\` В тестах используйте оператор \`()\` для обращения к ячейкам матрицы и сравнивайте полученные значения с ожидаемыми числами. Также возможно, вам потребуется исправить реализацию индексации в вашем коде. Текущая реализация оператора \`[]\` изменяет внутренние переменные \`current_x_\`, \`current_y_\` и \`current_z_\`, и возвращает ссылку на себя, что не кажется правильным для матрицы. Вместо этого вам нужно, чтобы каждый вызов \`[]\` возвращал значение или ссылку на значение, которое можно сравнить с \`int32_t\`."},{"instruction":"header #include <iostream> class Int17Matrix3D { public: Int17Matrix3D(int x, int y, int z);

Необходимо убедиться, что класс \`ConstProxy\` полностью определен до его использования, в частности, перед созданием его экземпляров в \`Int17Matrix3D::operator[]\`. 2. Обычно, когда используется прокси-класс для многомерного доступа через операторы \`[]\`, первый прокси возвращает экземпляр второго прокси-класса, который уже повторяет действие для следующего измерения и так далее до окончательного доступа к значению. Для возвращения константного значения, класс \`ConstProxy\` можно упростить. Предлагаемое название класса \`ConstProxy\` подразумевает работу с константной матрицей, но в текущей реализации он содержит не константную ссылку. 3. В функции \`GetValueAt\` вы пытаетесь вернуть результат вызова функции \`ToDecimal\`, который является временным объектом типа \`int32_t\`, однако сигнатура функции предполагает возврат ссылки на \`int32_t\`. Вам необходимо изменить логику прокси-класса. Ниже приведена исправленная версия: \`\`\`cpp class Int17Matrix3D; // Предварительное объявление класса class Proxy { public: Proxy(Int17Matrix3D& matrix, int x) : matrix_(matrix), x_(x) {} ProxyInt operator[](int y); // Создаем второй прокси-класс для доступа к y-измерению private: Int17Matrix3D& matrix_; int x_; }; class ProxyInt { public: ProxyInt(Int17Matrix3D& matrix, int x, int y) : matrix_(matrix), x_(x), y_(y) {} int32_t& operator[](int z); // Перегрузка оператора для доступа к z-измерению private: Int17Matrix3D& matrix_; int x_; int y_; }; class Int17Matrix3D { public: // ... опущена часть реализации класса для краткости ... Proxy operator[](int x); // Первый вызов возвращает прокси-объект int32_t GetValueAt(int x, int y, int z); // Изменено на возвращение копии значения }; \`\`\` Теперь вы должны определить реализацию для этих классов. Обратите внимание, что вам также понадобится реализовать логику проверки диапазона для индексов \`x\`, \`y\` и \`z\`. \`\`\`cpp // В файле реализации прокси (например, Int17Matrix3D.cpp): Proxy Proxy::operator[](int y) { return Proxy(matrix_, x_, y); } int32_t& ProxyInt::operator[](int z) { return matrix_.GetValueAt(x_, y_, z); } // В реализации класса Int17Matrix3D: int32_t Int17Matrix3D::GetValueAt(int x, int y, int z) { int index = GetIndex(x, y, z); // Проверьте диапазон для x, y и z перед доступом к массиву return ToDecimal(array_, index); // Может потребоваться изменить остальную логику } Proxy Int17Matrix3D::operator[](int x) { return Proxy(*this, x); } \`\`\` Ваши тесты должны работать с новой реализацией следующим образом: \`\`\`cpp TEST(Int17Matrix3DTest, ParenthesesOperator_EqTest) { Int17Matrix3D matrix(3, 3, 3); matrix[1][1][1] = 5; // Перегруженные операторы позволяют нам использовать такой синтаксис ASSERT_EQ(matrix[1][1][1], 5); } \`\`\` Убедитесь, что ваши функции исправно обрабатывают индексацию вглубь и что типы возвращаемым значений соответствуют логике использования (например, когда необходимо использовать копии вместо ссылок)."},{"instruction":"Some people argue that the companies and private individuals should pay the bill of cleaning up the pollution they produced, while others believe that it is the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","output":"There is a divisive debate regarding who should bear the financial burden of cleaning up pollution: should it be the responsibility of the companies and private individuals who produced the pollution, or should it fall on the shoulders of the government? Both perspectives have valid arguments, and a thorough examination of each is essential before forming an opinion. Supporters of the view that companies and individuals should pay for the pollution they produce argue that it is a matter of accountability. Those responsible for generating pollution should be held financially liable for the environmental damage they cause. By forcing them to clean up their own mess, this approach creates a direct link between the polluter and the consequences of their actions, serving as a strong deterrent for future pollution. Moreover, this responsibility instills a sense of environmental stewardship and encourages companies and individuals to adopt sustainable practices, reducing pollution altogether. On the other hand, proponents of the government's responsibility argue that the scale and complexity of pollution-related issues often exceed the capabilities of individual companies or private individuals. The government has specialized knowledge, resources, and legal authority to address pollution comprehensively. They argue that if companies and individuals were solely responsible for cleanup costs, it may lead to financial burdens that hinder economic growth. By nationalizing the responsibility, the government can distribute the costs across society and ensure that the cleanup efforts are carried out efficiently and effectively. In my opinion, it would be ideal to strike a balance between both perspectives. Companies and individuals should bear a substantial portion of the responsibility for the pollution they produce. This includes not only the cost of cleanup but also penalties for violating environmental regulations. This accountability will foster a culture of responsibility and encourage sustainable practices. However, the government should also play a vital role by providing oversight, regulation, and support. They can ensure that cleanup efforts are properly executed, and in cases where companies or individuals cannot address pollution independently, the government should step in to shoulder the responsibility. In conclusion, although a valid case can be made for both companies/individuals and the government to pay for pollution cleanup, a combined approach is the most practical solution. Shared responsibility ensures fairness, accountability, and efficient allocation of resources. Ultimately, it is in the best interest of society to work collectively towards environmental preservation and minimize pollution with a sense of shared responsibility."},{"instruction":"1.

Файл подкачки - это специальный файл на жестком диске компьютера, который используется операционной системой для хранения данных, которые не помещаются в оперативную память. Его назначение заключается в том, чтобы расширить доступную оперативную память и обеспечить возможность выполнения большого количества программ и процессов одновременно. 2. Файл подкачки имеет прямую связь с оперативной памятью, так как используется для хранения данных, которые не помещаются в ОЗУ. Процессор отправляет данные на диск, когда ОЗУ заполняется, и затем возвращает их обратно в ОЗУ, когда они снова становятся необходимыми. Этот процесс называется подкачкой и позволяет компьютеру эффективно использовать ограниченные ресурсы оперативной памяти. 3. Файл pagefile.sys - это основной файл подкачки в операционных системах семейства Windows. Он работает как вспомогательная память, хранящая временно неиспользуемые данные. Когда оперативная память заполняется, неиспользуемые данные перемещаются в файл pagefile.sys на жестком диске. Когда эти данные снова становятся необходимыми, они возвращаются в ОЗУ из файла pagefile.sys. 4. Файл swapfile.sys - это файл подкачки на компьютерах с операционной системой Linux. Он работает аналогично файлу pagefile.sys в Windows и служит для хранения временно неиспользуемых данных, когда оперативная память заполняется. Похожесть в названиях обусловлена разными операционными системами, которые используют разные термины для обозначения файла подкачки. 5. Оптимальный размер файла подкачки определяется в зависимости от конфигурации компьютера и его используемого программного обеспечения. Рекомендуется установить размер равным 1,5 или 2 раза объема установленной оперативной памяти. Однако, если компьютер имеет достаточное количество оперативной памяти, размер файла подкачки может быть увеличен или даже уменьшен для оптимальной производительности. 6.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","output":"There are different opinions on who should bear the responsibility for cleaning up pollution caused by companies and private individuals. Some argue that the financial burden should be placed on the parties directly responsible for the pollution, namely the companies and individuals. On the other hand, some believe that it is the government's duty to address and finance the cleanup efforts. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, both views will be discussed before presenting my own opinion. Proponents of the first view assert that companies and individuals who produce pollution should be held accountable by paying for the cleanup. They argue that these entities have directly caused the environmental harm and should, therefore, shoulder the financial consequences. From this perspective, placing the burden on the polluters promotes accountability and encourages them to adopt cleaner practices, as it directly impacts their bottom line. Additionally, collecting fines or levying fees for pollution can create a deterrent, discouraging further pollution in the future. On the other hand, supporters of the second view argue that the government should be responsible for cleaning up pollution. They emphasize that the government's primary role is to protect the well-being of its citizens and the environment. They believe that shifting the financial burden onto polluters may undermine the government's ability to fund essential services, such as healthcare, education, or infrastructure development. Moreover, governments have the authority and resources to implement comprehensive policies and regulations that can address pollution at its source more effectively. In my opinion, both arguments have their merits, but a balanced approach is necessary. Companies and private individuals should certainly be held accountable for the pollution they produce, as they have a direct impact on the health of the environment. Requiring them to bear the financial burden of cleanup efforts can incentivize sustainable practices and discourage pollution. However, it is also essential for the government to play a role in addressing pollution by setting strict regulations, monitoring compliance, and providing financial assistance when necessary. Ideally, a collaborative framework should be established, where the government plays a regulatory and supervisory role, and businesses and individuals are responsible for financing the cleanup efforts. This arrangement would promote shared responsibility and encourage a sense of environmental stewardship across all sectors. In conclusion, the question of who should bear the financial burden of cleaning up pollution caused by companies and private individuals is a complex one. While companies and individuals should be held accountable for their actions, the government must also play a role in crafting effective regulations and providing support when needed. A balanced approach that combines accountability and governmental intervention is crucial for addressing pollution effectively and sustainably."},{"instruction":"Write a story where Point Man (F.E.A.R.), The Batter (OFF), Sackboy and Master Xehanort are working at IKEA. Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","output":"It should have been just an ordinary day at the local IKEA store, nestled on the outskirts of the city, its blue and yellow signage standing out like a beacon for all those in need of affordable furniture and home accessories. But today was no ordinary day for the employees of this gigantic maze of Swedish design. Among the regular staff were four unique temporary workers: Point Man, The Batter, Sackboy, and Master Xehanort. Each had come from vastly different worlds and backgrounds, now united by the curious circumstance of employment at this vast emporium of ready-to-assemble furniture. As customers bustled in to avail themselves of the latest sale, the store manager, a perky woman by the name of Linda, gathered her unconventional new team for a morning brief. \\"Okay team, remember, customer satisfaction is our main goal!\\" Linda said with an enthusiastic clap of her hands. \\"John, or should I say, Point Man, you'll be assisting with the heavy lifting in the warehouse. Batter, you'll be our expert in the PAX wardrobe section. Sackboy, your job will be greeting the children in the play area. And Master Xehanort, you'll be overseeing the self-service furniture area.\\" The group of temporary additions to IKEA's workforce merely nodded, each processing their tasks according to their individual natures. The morning passed with Point Man working silently, his military precision evident as he stacked flat-packed boxes with impeccable accuracy. Despite the mundane task, his alert eyes constantly scanned the environment, approaching his task with the seriousness of a covert operation. Nearby, co-workers whispered about the intensity in his gaze and the disciplined silence that surrounded him. The Batter, clad in his striking uniform, approached his PAX wardrobes with the dutiful intent of one determined to eradicate imperfections. \\"Align the shelves perfectly,\\" he would muse to himself, offering advice to the customers with a curt nod. \\"The key is balance and harmony; your belongings must find their rightful place within the space.\\" Little Sackboy, the embodiment of whimsy, delighted the children. His stitched smile and button eyes brought giggles and smiles to the young visitors whose parents were engrossed in the labyrinthine store. \\"Come on little ones! Let's build a castle from soft cushions and magical throws,\\" he chirped with glee, becoming the favorite among the children for his playful demeanor and creative spirit. Master Xehanort, meanwhile, exuded an air of gravitas in his role, his white hair and dark cloak giving him an almost otherworldly presence among the DIY furniture. When customers approached, confused by the pictogram instructions, he'd offer insights with a touch of impatience. \\"Foolishness,\\" he'd grumble under his breath, \\"can't they see the obvious order of assembly?\\" Yet, when he helped, his skill was unmistakable, and the furniture came together as if by magic, almost making the customers forget the dark undertone in his assistance. Throughout the day, Linda observed her unlikely employees with a mix of amusement and bewilderment. Despite their eccentricities, the store ran efficiently, their unique talents complementing the IKEA roster perfectly. It wasn't until the late afternoon that a true challenge presented itself. A family was in a dispute over the color scheme of their living room. They argued loudly among the displays, drawing the attention of the entire staff. Point Man was the first to arrive, his instincts kicking in as he approached the family with a calming presence. \\"Excuse me,\\" he said, his voice quiet but firm. \\"Perhaps I can assist in resolving the conflict?\\" The Batter was not far behind, offering his philosophical touch. \\"Each one of you seeks harmony in your heart, mirroring the desires in your living space,\\" he intoned wisely. \\"Consider not just the color, but the essence of what you want your family to feel.\\" Sackboy bounced over, holding up various cushions. \\"Look at these colors! Like a rainbow, they can all fit together. Why don't you all pick one color you like, and we'll make it work!\\" As the tension defused, Master Xehanort walked over with a hint of a smirk on his face. \\"Conflict breeds strength,\\" he said in a low voice. \\"But it must be directed. See how these individuals offer their guidance? Heed their counsel, and your domestic squabble shall transform into a unity of design.\\" Under the influence of this eclectic group, the family reconciled their differences, each selecting an element of the design. Their combined effort led to a stunning new concept that satisfied all parties. As the store began to close, Linda thanked her peculiar day staff. \\"You might not be the team I expected,\\" she said, smiling warmly, \\"but you've delivered results like no other. Thank you for your hard work today.\\" Point Man gave a slight nod. The Batter simply tipped his cap. Sackboy waved enthusiastically, and Master Xehanort allowed a rare, small grin to touch his lips. They all went their separate ways as the sun dipped below the horizon, an unlikely crew who brought order, creativity, and a touch of magic to an unassuming IKEA store, if only for a day."},{"instruction":"What were the features of national political life in the United States in 1996?","output":"In 1996, the landscape of national political life in the United States was characterized by several key features: 1. Presidential Election: The major event of 1996 in American politics was the presidential election. Incumbent President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, ran for re-election against the Republican nominee, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. Reform Party candidate Ross Perot also ran, though with less impact than his 1992 campaign. 2. Clinton's Incumbency: Bill Clinton's first term was marked by a mix of political successes and controversies. He had gained popularity for presiding over a period of economic prosperity with significant job growth and the beginning of efforts to balance the federal budget. The success of welfare reform and the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were among other notable elements of his presidency. 3. Republican Revolution Aftermath: The mid-term elections of 1994, often referred to as the \\"Republican Revolution,\\" saw the GOP taking control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate for the first time in four decades. The Republicans, under the leadership of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, had campaigned on the \\"Contract with America,\\" promising a conservative agenda. By 1996, this led to a contentious political climate, including a government shutdown over budget disagreements. 4. Legislative Gridlock: The sharp partisan divide between the Republican-controlled Congress and the Democratic President led to significant legislative gridlock. While some legislation passed, such as welfare reform, other initiatives were deadlocked. 5. Economy and Budget: Economic issues took center stage, with a focus on balancing the budget and maintaining the nation's economic growth. President Clinton and the Republican Congress clashed over how to achieve a balanced budget but eventually reached a series of agreements that set the stage for budget surpluses in the following years. 6. Campaign Finance: The role of money in politics became a concern with the scrutiny of campaign financing practices. Scandals involving fundraising activities during the 1996 election, including those related to the Democratic National Committee, drew attention to the need for campaign finance reform. 7. Social Issues: Debates on social issues such as abortion, gun control, and gay rights continued to shape the political dialogue, with the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and the Brady Bill being points of contention. 8. Foreign Policy: Foreign policy played a relatively minor role in the 1996 election. However, there were ongoing international issues such as interventions in the Balkans, the peace process in the Middle East, and relations with China and Russia. 9. Media and Technology: The rise of cable news and the growing importance of the internet began to change the nature of political communication and campaigning. The 1996 election saw an increased use of television advertising and the beginnings of harnessing the internet for political purposes. The 1996 election ultimately resulted in Bill Clinton winning a second term, defeating Bob Dole by a substantial margin. Clinton's re-election seemed to endorse his centrist approach to governance and suggested that the electorate was more in favor of his policies than the more conservative agenda advanced by congressional Republicans at the time."},{"instruction":"What were the major features of disposable diapers in 1996? What was the backing material of a disposable diaper typically made of? What sorts of designs did they feature?","output":"In 1996, disposable diapers were an essential part of childcare for many families across the world. The major features of disposable diapers at the time shared similarities with modern-day disposables but were less advanced in terms of materials and design. Here is an overview of the features from that era: 1. Absorbency: One of the primary functions of disposable diapers in 1996 was to offer a high level of absorbency. Manufacturers used layers of fluff pulp combined with superabsorbent polymers (SAP), which could retain many times their weight in liquid. These materials helped keep babies dry for extended periods. 2. Construction: Disposable diapers typically consisted of three layers – an inner layer that sat against the baby's skin, designed to be soft and to wick moisture away; a middle absorbent layer that contained fluff pulp and SAP to hold the liquid; and an outer waterproof layer to prevent leaks. 3. Backing Material: The outer layer of disposable diapers in the mid-1990s was typically made from a plastic material, often polyethylene film, which acted as a waterproof backing. This helped to keep moisture inside the diaper and prevent any leaks. 4. Fastening System: Disposable diapers in this period used either adhesive tape or Velcro-like hook and loop fasteners to secure the diaper. This made the diapers adjustable and allowed for a better fit around the baby's waist and legs. 5. Elastic Elements: Diapers then featured elastic around the leg cuffs and the waistband to create barriers against leaks. Elastic components helped the diaper to fit more snugly and conform to the baby's movements. 6. Shape and Fit: Disposable diapers of the time often had a bulkier fit compared to modern ultra-thin designs. They were contoured to fit between the baby's legs but weren't as tailored as current diapers, which use more advanced materials to provide a closer fit while remaining slim. 7. Designs: Diapers in 1996 were less varied in terms of design than they are today. While some brands started introducing playful patterns and characters on the outer layer, many diapers were still plain white or featured simple designs or brand logos. 8. Size and Convenience: Producers offered a range of diaper sizes to accommodate different ages and weights. The convenience of disposable diapers compared to cloth diapers was a significant selling feature, promoting their use for busy families and on the go. Over time, diaper technology and design have evolved, leading to thinner, more absorbent, and environmentally friendlier options. Manufacturers have also increasingly moved away from purely plastic outer layers to more breathable, cloth-like materials that are still leak-proof. Additionally, modern disposables often come in a variety of fun prints and are designed to be more comfortable and less intrusive on a baby's movements."},{"instruction":"Write a scene, set in 1996, featuring two upper-middle-class housewives gossiping at home as they watch over the toddler son of one of them. The women primarily gossip about the upcoming election, talking about a Clinton and Dole’s political scandals while the boy, clad only in a thick disposable diaper, plays with his toys and toddles about on a blanket that’s been spread out for him to play on. The women bemoan the current state of American politics in trite terms, and joke that the men running the country are like babies, tittering that perhaps they need a strict woman to put them in their place, grinning wryly at the boy as they do so. The boy, sensing that he’s being talked about, turns to his mommy and her friend, pouting uncertainly. The women titter away, thinking he’s just adorable, and enjoying the sight of him toddling about in his thick, babyish diaper. It should be noted that, while the women are caring and nurturing towards the boy, there is a strong undercurrent of patronizing condescension in their treatment of him. Even though the boy does not fully understand what’s going on, he understands that the women have their eyes on him, and it makes him squirm. He is beginning to understand the concept of privacy, and just how little of it he has.","output":"INT. UPSCALE SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY The room is bathed in the soft glow of mid-morning sunlight filtering through the sheer curtains. A sprawling blanket occupies a corner of the living room, with a smattering of colorful toys scattered across its expanse. In the middle of this makeshift play area, TODDLER LUCAS, a chubby-cheeked boy with a mop of curly hair, is the picture of innocence. Dressed only in a thick, crinkling disposable diaper, he sits squatting, alternating his undivided attention between a plastic block in his hand and a spinning top wobbling on the floor. Nearby, two women, JULIA and ANNE, both in their mid-thirties and dressed in polished casual wear, are perched on the plush sofa. Julia, Lucas's mom, is the very definition of a '90s upper-middle-class matriarch, sporting a neatly coiffed bob and a warm, maternal glow. Anne, her best friend, mirrors her sophistication, her laughter a melodic lilt that complements Julia's earnest tones. A well-worn issue of \\"Time\\" magazine, featuring BILL CLINTON and BOB DOLE, is splayed open on the coffee table before them. The sounds of a television reporting on the election buzz in the background, almost as if commenting on the scene. JULIA (sighing) Everything's just scandal after scandal. Sometimes I think we'd be better off with Lucas here in charge! Julia gestures playfully towards the toddler, a faux seriousness on her face. ANNE (laughing) Oh, definitely! At least his biggest dilemma is choosing between the rubber ducky or the squeaky toy. The two women share a knowing glance, their eyes returning to the television screen as an anchor dives into a recap of the latest campaign trail controversy. ANNE (rolling her eyes) And did you hear about Dole's campaign blunders? They say he's lost without his advisors pointing him in the right direction! JULIA (shaking her head) Like babies! Maybe what this country needs is a strict nanny to put all these men in their place. Anne nods, her grin widening. They both turn to glance at Lucas, whose cherubic face scrunches up in a pout of uncertainty, sensing he's the subject of attention but not understanding the context. JULIA (cooing) Aww, look at him! You think we're talking about you, huh? Lucas looks between Julia and Anne, his eyes wide, the gears turning in his little head. As he clumsily rises to his feet, steadying himself with a plump hand on the blanket, he unwittingly provides a perfect visual metaphor for the bumbling politicians. ANNE (teasingly) Well, if our future president could balance the budget as well as he balances on those chunky little legs! The women titter, much to Lucas's chagrin. He begins to toddle across the blanket, the sound of his diaper rustling loudly with each precarious step, a clear indication of his baby status to both women and their indulgent watchfulness. There's an air of condescension that underlies their affection – a gentle mocking that's common in adult conversations about children but is beginning to intrude on Lucas's burgeoning sense of self. LUCAS (frowning, softly) No, no... Despite his meager protest, his tone is lost in the chorus of their amusement. Lucas, catching his reflection in the shiny surface of a toy, seems to suddenly grasp, in a way only a toddler can, the concept of being seen but not heard, and the desire for a shred of autonomy blooms within him. JULIA (patronizingly) Oh, honey, you've got no idea what's going on, do you? But aren't you just the cutest thing? ANNE (sweetly) And the most dignified one in the room, right? Lucas, still the object of their affection, picks up on the energies directed his way. His little brow furrows as he catches his reflection again, a silent observer to the adult world and its complexities, which he feels but does not quite comprehend.

Helium-2 (also known as diproton) is an exotic, highly unstable isotope consisting of two protons and no neutrons. It decays almost instantaneously through the emission of a positron (a positively charged electron) and a neutrino, transforming into hydrogen-2 (deuterium) in the process. In this beta decay process, one of the protons in helium-2 converts into a neutron, while simultaneously emitting a positron and a neutrino. The emission of the neutrino carries away some of the energy from the decay and helps to conserve energy, momentum, and angular momentum during the process. Without the presence of neutrinos, the beta decay of helium-2 would be severely disrupted. The absence of neutrinos would hinder the conservation laws associated with the decay, leading to a violation of fundamental principles in physics. However, it's important to note that neutrinos play a role in various other fundamental processes in the universe, such as in nuclear reactions within stars, supernovae explosions, and the overall dynamics of the universe. Neutrinos are a crucial component of our understanding of particle physics and astrophysics."},{"instruction":"Imaginary star is made of pure protons and has 10 solar masses, absence of electrons and neutrons. If neutrinos never existed, what happens to stellar nucleosynthesis in imaginary star?","output":"If neutrinos never existed and the imaginary star was made of pure protons without electrons and neutrons, it would have a significant impact on stellar nucleosynthesis. Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which elements are formed within stars through nuclear reactions. Neutrinos play a crucial role in many of the nuclear reactions that occur in stellar cores. In particular, neutrons are converted into protons through a process called beta decay, which involves the emission of a W- boson and an electron antineutrino. In the absence of neutrinos, the beta decay process would be inhibited or, in some cases, not possible at all. This would disrupt the conversion of protons into neutrons and vice versa, affecting the synthesis of elements within the star. Without a mechanism for converting protons into neutrons, the primary fusion reaction in stars (known as the proton-proton chain) would be severely hindered. This chain of reactions is responsible for the fusion of hydrogen into helium, which releases energy and powers a star. In a star made solely of protons, without neutrinos to facilitate the conversion of protons to neutrons during the fusion process, nuclear reactions would be limited. The star would struggle to sustain the necessary fusion reactions to release energy, which would impact its stability and longevity. Overall, the absence of neutrinos would significantly disrupt stellar nucleosynthesis and could lead to the inability of the star to sustain its fusion processes, potentially altering its evolutionary path and eventual fate."},{"instruction":"美国英特尔公司的背景","output":"英特尔公司是一家全球领先的半导体生产公司，总部位于美国加利福尼亚州的圣克拉拉市。英特尔公司成立于1968年，由罗伯特·诺伊斯和戴维·豪斯共同创立。在过去的几十年里，英特尔公司一直是计算机和信息技术领域的关键推动者和领导者之一。 英特尔公司专注于设计和制造半导体芯片，并提供与计算和通信相关的技术和解决方案。该公司以其知名的“Intel Inside”品牌而闻名，该品牌用于标志着装有英特尔处理器的计算机产品。 英特尔公司的产品包括微处理器、芯片组、嵌入式系统、图形处理器、服务器产品、存储芯片和网络连接设备等。其处理器产品被广泛应用于个人电脑、服务器、工作站、智能手机、平板电脑、物联网设备等各种计算设备。 英特尔公司在全球范围内拥有广泛的研发实验室、生产工厂和销售渠道。该公司不仅在技术研发方面保持着领先地位，还与全球各地的合作伙伴合作，推动技术创新和产品发展。 作为全球最大的半导体公司之一，英特尔公司在业界享有很高的声誉和影响力。它不仅是科技行业的领军企业，还在社会责任、环境可持续性等方面积极推动可持续发展。"},{"instruction":"英特尔公司的相关利益者分析","output":"英特尔公司的利益相关者包括以下各方： 1. 股东：作为公司的所有者，股东对公司的盈利能力和股价表现感兴趣。股东希望公司能够提供稳定的回报并增加股东价值。 2. 客户：包括个人消费者和企业客户。客户希望获得高质量的产品和创新技术，以满足他们的计算需求。他们还关注价格竞争力、产品可靠性和售后服务。 3. 合作伙伴：包括设备制造商、软件开发商、云服务提供商等。合作伙伴与英特尔合作，共同开发和推广各种技术解决方案。他们希望英特尔能够提供有竞争力的产品和技术支持，并与他们建立长期稳定的合作关系。 4. 员工：公司的员工是其最重要的资产之一。员工希望获得公平的薪资待遇、良好的工作环境和发展机会。他们还希望公司能提供有竞争力的福利和职业发展机会。 5. 政府和监管机构：政府和监管机构对英特尔公司的运营和产品安全性有一定的监管职责。他们希望公司遵守相关法规和标准，确保产品的质量和安全性，并为经济做出贡献。 6. 社会和环境组织：社会和环境组织关注公司的社会责任和环境可持续性。他们希望公司能够采取可持续发展的业务实践，减少环境影响并积极参与社会公益事业。 以上只是一些主要的利益相关者，实际上还有其他一些特定的利益相关者，如供应商、竞争对手、学术界、社区等。英特尔公司通过与各方合作，并积极回应他们的需求和关切，以实现利益共享和长期可持续发展。"},{"instruction":"商业计划书一般是写什么内容","output":"商业计划书是一份详细描述和规划企业经营活动的文档。它提供了对企业战略、运营模式和财务预测的深入分析。以下是商业计划书一般包含的内容： 1. 概述：对企业或项目的简介和概述，包括企业的使命、愿景和价值主张。 2. 执行摘要：对商业计划的总结，提供概述、亮点和关键信息，以便读者能够快速了解计划的核心内容。 3. 产品或服务描述：详细说明企业的产品或服务，包括特点、优势和市场定位。描述产品的独特性，并解释它如何满足市场需求。 4. 市场分析：对目标市场的研究和分析，包括市场规模、增长趋势、竞争态势和目标客户群体。通过市场调研和数据分析，展示企业在市场中的机会和挑战。 5. 营销策略：详细说明企业的营销策略和销售计划，包括定位策略、市场推广活动和客户获取渠道。 6. 组织和管理：介绍企业的组织结构、团队成员和管理层。描述团队的经验和能力，并提供团队成员的背景信息。 7. 运营计划：详细描述企业的运营策略和运营流程，包括供应链管理、生产或服务交付流程和质量控制措施。 8. 财务计划：列出企业的财务数据和财务预测，包括销售预测、成本结构、资金需求和预计的盈利能力。提供关键财务指标，如现金流量表、损益表和资产负债表。 9. 风险评估：识别和评估企业面临的潜在风险和挑战，如市场风险、竞争风险和法律合规风险。提供相应的风险管理措施和应对策略。 10. 实施计划：阐述实施商业计划的具体步骤和时间表。描述如何监测和评估计划的执行，并制定适应性调整的计划。 商业计划书的内容可以根据企业的具体情况和目的进行调整和扩展。它的目标是向潜在投资者、合作伙伴、银行或其他利益相关方传达企业的商业价值和可行性。"},{"instruction":"Fill out Intel's business plan: Name: Title: Main Business Address: Postal Address: ABN: ACN:","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't fill out that business plan for you."},{"instruction":"Fill out Intel's business plan: Business Name: Business Structure: ABN: ACN: Business Location: Date Established: Business Owner(s): Relevant Owner Experience:","output":"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific information about Intel's business plan."},{"instruction":"英特尔的使命宣言与目标","output":"英特尔公司的使命宣言是通过强大的半导体技术构建智能、互联的世界。他们致力于通过创新推动世界各地的技术进步，为人们的生活和工作带来更多的可能性。 英特尔公司的目标是成为全球最重要的半导体公司之一，通过以下几个方面实现： 1. 领导者地位：英特尔致力于在半导体行业保持领导地位，并通过研发创新的技术和解决方案来推动行业的发展。 2. 产品卓越：英特尔致力于提供卓越的产品和技术，包括处理器、芯片组、嵌入式系统、存储芯片和网络连接设备等。他们追求高性能、低功耗和可靠性，以满足不同应用的需求。 3. 客户导向：英特尔注重与客户的密切合作，了解和满足他们的需求。他们努力提供可靠的支持和卓越的售后服务，确保客户的满意度。 4. 可持续发展：英特尔公司注重可持续发展，致力于减少对环境的影响，并在社会责任方面发挥积极作用。他们致力于提高产品的能效、推动绿色生产和回收利用，并在技术创新的同时推动社会进步。 总体而言，英特尔的目标是成为可持续性发展和技术创新的全球领导者，以推动智能世界的发展和人们生活的改善。"},{"instruction":"Intel's Relevant Owner Experience","output":"Intel's relevant owner experience can be understood by examining the key individuals who have played significant roles in the company's leadership and direction.

Dit werk is een van de fundamenten van de moderne filosofie en presenteert een visie op God, de wereld, de menselijke natuur en onze plaats in het universum. Spinoza gebruikt een methode die is geïnspireerd door de geometrie van Euclides, waarbij hij axioma's, definities en propositioneel bewijs gebruikt om zijn filosofische stellingen te formuleren. De ethiek van Spinoza omvat een vijftal delen: 1. Over God (De Deus): Spinoza stelt dat er slechts één substantie is, oftewel God of de natuur (Deus sive Natura), die zowel de natuurwetten als de spirituele principes omvat. Alles wat bestaat, is een aspect of modus van deze ene substantie. God is de oorzakelijkheid van alle dingen en daardoor kunnen we spreken van een immanent godsbegrip; God is niet transcendent ten opzichte van de wereld. 2. Over de aard van en de oorsprong van de geest (De Mente): Hierin behandelt Spinoza de menselijke geest (cognitie) en de manieren waarop het begrip van God de menselijke kennis vergroot. Volgens Spinoza leidt de juiste kennis tot \\"intellectuele liefde tot God\\" (amor intellectualis Dei). 3. Over de oorsprong en aard van de emoties (De Affectibus): Spinoza beschrijft de menselijke emoties of affecten en hoe deze voortkomen uit de interactie tussen de modi van de substantie. Volgens Spinoza zijn passies geketend aan misverstanden of inadequate ideeën en leiden ze tot slavernij van de geest. 4. Over de menselijke slavernij of de macht van de emoties (De Servitute Humana): Spinoza stelt dat de mensen emotioneel in slavernij kunnen leven door hun onbegrip van de ware aard van de dingen (waaronder hun eigen emoties). Wanneer mensen worden beheerst door passies, zijn ze niet vrij. 5. Over de macht van het verstand, of over de menselijke vrijheid (De Libertate Humana): Ten slotte voert Spinoza aan dat vrijheid bereikt wordt door het verstand en de kennis van de ware aard van de werkelijkheid. Door onze geestelijke capaciteiten kunnen we ontstijgen aan onze basale instincten en passies en zo een vorm van zelfrealisatie en morele autonomie bereiken. Voor Spinoza betekent ethisch leven het begrijpen en omarmen van onze plaats in de natuur, en het streven naar geestelijke helderheid door de ratio. Heldere en ware ideeën stellen ons in staat onze emoties te beheersen, autonoom en vrij te leven en intellectuele liefde voor God en daarmee voor de gehele substantie van de realiteit te ontwikkelen."},{"instruction":"персонаж warface НОВЫЙ ГОД","output":"Одним из персонажей, связанных с празднованием Нового года в игре Warface, является Снеговик.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","output":"On an alternate Earth, where dimensions collided and characters from different universes converged in bizarre realities, an IKEA store sat at the crossroads of worlds. The staff here were unlike any other: Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, an assassin from the Holy Land; Joel Miller, a gritty survivor of a fungal apocalypse; Freddy Fazbear, an animatronic bear with a haunting past; and Dark Samus, an embodiment of phazon corruption from a distant galaxy. Their mission at IKEA was simple yet surreal—to blend into the reality of everyday sales associates while maintaining the delicate peace that kept their worlds intersecting in harmony. On a particularly busy Saturday morning, the store buzzed with customers. Joel was heaving flat-packed furniture onto the shelves, his rugged face folded into a frown as he grumbled under his breath. \\"Should be building a barricade with these Billy bookcases, not stacking 'em for families to take home.\\" Joel sighed, pausing to wipe the sweat from his brow with a bandana. Nearby, Altaïr perched on top of a shelving unit, his keen eyes scanning the customers below. To him, the throngs of people looked like targets in the market districts of Damascus, yet they were simply searching for the right curtain rods and bed frames. \\"Joel,\\" Altaïr called out, his voice barely above a whisper yet carrying the weight of experience. \\"Patience is as much a virtue in this world as it is on the rooftops of Acre. Besides, these flat packages make for poor cover.\\" Joel looked up and chuckled, \\"You've got a point there, assassin.\\" Freddy Fazbear was stationed in the children's section, an otherworldly gleam in his digital eyes as he demonstrated the durability of a DUKTIG play kitchen. \\"And that's not all, little ones!\\" Freddy's voice boomed, the mechanic gears in his throat oddly fitting in the cacophony of the play area. \\"With just a little bit of imagination, you can cook up anything your heart desires!\\" The children clapped with glee, unbothered by Freddy's imposing figure; in their eyes, he was just another one of IKEA's entertaining elements. Across the showroom, Dark Samus glided through the lighting department, her otherworldly form casting eerie shadows against the modern fixtures. Customers gave her a wide berth, her unspoken aura both fascinating and terrifying. \\"Excuse me,\\" a brave customer approached, her voice trembling. \\"Could you help me with these LEDBERG lights?\\" Dark Samus turned, her actions slow and deliberate, and extended a hand, encased in her dark suit, to take the light strips. As she handed them to the customer, her unnatural voice resonated softly, \\"These will provide ample illumination.\\" The customer nodded, unease fading into gratitude. \\"Thank you. They're perfect.\\" As the day rolled on and the lunch break loomed, the four unlikely coworkers convened in the staff break room, their presences forming an odd tableau against the minimalistic decor. \\"So,\\" Joel began, unwrapping a sandwich from the small fridge, \\"How's everyone holding up?\\" Altaïr removed his hood, revealing marked features hardened by his former life. \\"The crowds have been taxing, but nothing I haven't seen before in the markets. Monitoring from above has its advantages,\\" he said, taking a sip of water from a KORKEN bottle. Freddy's voice took on a cheerier note, \\"The kids are endless fun! A bit quieter than at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but fun nonetheless. Hope I'm not giving 'em nightmares, though.\\" Dark Samus remained silent, merely nodding in her corner seat. Her presence was an affirmation of her seamless adaptation to this ordinary environment. The break passed quickly, and soon they were back on the floor. The afternoon rush brought chaos, but the team worked in a strange harmony, their exceptional skills now repurposed for everyday customer service. Altaïr showcased his agility by climbing up to retrieve items from the top storages without a ladder, impressing shoppers with his swiftness. Joel used his survivor's strength to assist customers with loading heavy furniture sets, while Freddy expertly recommended bedroom decor with an entertainer's flair. Dark Samus, with her intimidating presence, became an unexpected deterrent to irate or unruly customers. As the day came to a close and the last customer left, the group assembled once more near the cash registers, the calm after the storm settling over them. Altaïr nodded to his companions. \\"In the strangest of circumstances, we have found camaraderie. This… IKEA has brought together the most unlikely of allies.\\" Joel smirked, \\"Never thought I'd be thankful for a day's work at a furniture store, but here we are. It's the people you're stuck with that make it bearable, I guess.\\" Freddy threw his arms up, \\"I'm always up for a little song and dance to make the time go by!\\" Dark Samus remained impassive, yet her silence seemed more comfortable than before, a sign of her growing acclimation to this shared world. Together, Altaïr, Joel, Freddy, and Dark Samus had forged a unique bond, their lives improbably intertwined in the labyrinth of a Swedish home goods store. They had become the most unconventional yet efficient team members, each bringing their extraordinary pasts into a mundane setting, creating an IKEA experience none would soon forget."},{"instruction":"Describe preonic rearranger, it converting two photons into matter and antimatter.","output":"The preonic rearranger is a hypothetical device that is believed to be able to convert two photons into both matter and antimatter particles. It is based on the concept of preons, which are theoretical subatomic particles that could be the building blocks of quarks and leptons, the elementary particles that constitute matter. The process of converting photons into matter and antimatter using the preonic rearranger involves the following steps: 1. Photon Capture: Two high-energy photons, typically gamma photons, are captured using a specialized mechanism. These photons carry no mass but have a specific amount of energy. 2. Preonic Interaction: The captured photons interact with preons, which are theoretical particles smaller than quarks and leptons. This interaction triggers a rearrangement of the preons, leading to the formation of a preonic configuration that can generate both matter and antimatter particles. 3. Matter and Antimatter Creation: The rearranged preons generate a pair of particles, one being a matter particle and the other an antimatter particle. For example, this could result in the creation of an electron (matter) and a positron (antimatter), or a quark (matter) and an antiquark (antimatter). 4. Energy Conservation: The energy from the photons is preserved in the newly created matter-antimatter pair, as mass and energy are interconnected according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc². It is important to note that the preonic rearranger is a purely theoretical concept at this point and has not been realized or observed experimentally. The ability to convert photons into matter and antimatter would have profound implications for particle physics and energy generation, as it could potentially provide a new means of matter production and energy transformation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The convenience and reliability of cable television may still be valued by some customers, even though not everyone will switch to cable television. The trend of networks selling directly to consumers through OTT services is likely to have a notable impact on traditional cable television service providers. Consumers will have a wider array of choices with a proliferation of network-specific streaming options. With traditional cable television services offering scheduled content, OTT services become increasingly appealing since preferences shift towards on-demand and personalized content. Cable providers may need to adapt by offering more flexible packages, integrating OTT options, and reassessing bundling strategies to remain competitive in a landscape where networks are increasingly selling directly to consumers. The rise of networks selling directly to consumers through Over-the-Top (OTT) services is likely to influence other networks in the industry. The success of early adopters and the shifting competitive landscape may prompt networks that haven't embraced direct-to-consumer strategies to reconsider their approach. The appeal of diversified revenue streams, increased control over content, and adapting to evolving consumer preferences are key factors that might drive other networks to explore similar models to stay competitive in the dynamic media landscape. rewrite and make it better","output":"Furthermore, it is crucial to address how the demand for cable television services will be affected if more networks start selling their content directly to consumers. The increasing availability of these over-the-top (OTT) services is likely to lead cable customers to switch to them, as more networks offer direct-to-consumer options. This is because changing consumer preferences are favoring the wide range of programming choices provided by streaming services. As a result, the demand for traditional cable television services may decline. However, it is important to note that there will still be some customers who value the convenience and reliability of cable television. Therefore, not everyone will switch to these OTT services. Nevertheless, the increasing trend of networks selling directly to consumers through OTT platforms will have a significant impact on traditional cable providers. With the proliferation of network-specific streaming options, consumers will have a greater variety of choices. Since OTT services offer on-demand and personalized content, which align with the preferences of many consumers, cable providers may need to adapt to remain competitive. This could involve offering more flexible packages, integrating OTT options into their services, and reevaluating bundling strategies. By doing so, traditional cable providers can continue to cater to customer preferences in a landscape where networks are increasingly moving towards selling directly to consumers. Moreover, the success of early adopters and the changing competitive landscape may urge networks that have not yet embraced direct-to-consumer strategies to reconsider their approach. The appeal of diversified revenue streams, increased control over content, and the need to adapt to evolving consumer preferences are key factors that could drive these networks to explore similar models. This adaptation is necessary to stay competitive in the dynamic media landscape and meet the changing demands of consumers. Overall, as more networks sell content directly to consumers through OTT services, the demand for traditional cable television services is likely to be influenced. Cable providers must adapt to this trend by offering more flexible options, integrating OTT services, and reassessing their bundling strategies. Meanwhile, networks that have not embraced direct-to-consumer strategies may be prompted to do so in order to compete effectively and meet evolving consumer preferences."},{"instruction":"How do you confirm out break","output":"To confirm an outbreak, follow these steps: 1.

Some species have minute eyes that are unfit for identifying females, while others have underdeveloped nostrils, making them unlikely to effectively find females by smell. When a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a \`\`one male per female'' rule."},{"instruction":"does lego jurassic world have all 4 movie","output":"Lego Jurassic World is a Lego-themed action-adventure video game developed by TT Fusion and published by Warner Bros.

The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215).

Thus, while they are not ultimately cooled by the liquid, because of the liquid-coolant circuit they are known as water-cooled. In contrast, heat generated by an air-cooled engine is released directly into the air. (Direct Cooled Engine) Typically this is facilitated with metal fins covering the outside of the Cylinder Head and cylinders which increase the surface area that air can act on. Air may be force fed with the use of a fan and shroud to achieve efficient cooling with high volumes of air or simply by natural air flow with well designed and angled fins."},{"instruction":"e they making a god of war serie","output":"God of War is an action-adventure video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE).

Whether animals apart from humans also experience pain is often contentious despite being scientifically verifiable. The standard measure of pain in humans is how a person reports that pain, (for example, on a pain scale). \`\`Pain'' is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as \`\`an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.'' Only the person experiencing the pain can know the pain's quality and intensity, and the degree of suffering. However, for non-human animals, it is harder, if even possible, to know whether an emotional experience has occurred. Therefore, this concept is often excluded in definitions of pain in animals, such as that provided by Zimmerman: \`\`an aversive sensory experience caused by actual or potential injury that elicits protective motor and vegetative reactions, results in learned avoidance and may modify species-specific behaviour, including social behaviour.'' Non-human animals cannot report their feelings to language-using humans in the same manner as human communication, but observation of their behaviour provides a reasonable indication as to the extent of their pain. Just as with doctors and medics who sometimes share no common language with their patients, the indicators of pain can still be understood."},{"instruction":"has croatia ever been in a world cup final before","output":"Croatia national football team have appeared in the FIFA World Cup on five occasions (in 1998, 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2018) since gaining independence in 1991.

This awards the player a score of one for the hole. Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one are considered to also contain an element of luck. As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an albatross). As of October 2008, a condor (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole."},{"instruction":"an selfdefence be a defence to affray uk","output":"Self-defence is a legal doctrine which says that a person may use reasonable force in the defence of himself or another.

This is influenced by current politics in the United States, as well as consumerism, fame, religion and technology, with the \`\`forgetful, distractible oddballs'' Turner embodies as narrators frequently becoming distracted from its social commentary. These multiple narrators are unreliable, \`\`sometimes barely (able to) string a sentence together'' and were inspired by lounge music.

Most hypotheses propose that oceanic crust was undergoing flat-slab subduction, i.e., with a shallow subduction angle, and as a consequence, no magmatism occurred in the central west of the continent, and the underlying oceanic lithosphere actually caused drag on the root of the overlying continental lithosphere. One cause for shallow subduction may have been an increased rate of plate convergence. Another proposed cause was subduction of thickened oceanic crust."},{"instruction":"does george's father die in grey's anatomy","output":"During a camping trip, O'Malley learns that Torres has slept with chief of plastic surgery Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and also discovers that Burke is experiencing tremors in his hand.

Pneumothorax was not a new technique by any means. In 1696, Giorgio Baglivi reported a general improvement in tuberculosis sufferers after they received sword wounds to the chest. F.H. Ramadge induced the first successful therapeutic pneumothorax in 1834, and reported subsequently the patient was cured. It was in the 20th century, however, that scientists sought to rigorously investigate the effectiveness of such procedures. In 1939, the British Journal of Tuberculosis published a study by Oli Hjaltested and Kjeld Törning on 191 patients undergoing the procedure between 1925 and 1931; in 1951, Roger Mitchell published several articles on the therapeutic outcomes of 557 patients treated between 1930 and 1939 at Trudeau Sanatorium in Saranac Lake.

Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \`\`dairy bull'' or a \`\`beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age. A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months. Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf."},{"instruction":"el segundo in the city of los angele","output":"El Segundo is a city located in Los Angeles County, California, United States.

This was further elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz (1899, 1904) in the framework of Lorentz ether theory. He defined mass as the ratio of force to acceleration, not as the ratio of momentum to velocity, so he needed to distinguish between the mass m L = γ 3 m (displaystyle m_(L)=gamma ^(3)m) parallel to the direction of motion and the mass m T = γ m (displaystyle m_(T)=gamma m) perpendicular to the direction of motion (where γ = 1 / 1 − v 2 / c 2 (displaystyle gamma =1/(sqrt (1-v^(2)/c^(2)))) is the Lorentz factor, v is the relative velocity between the aether and the object, and c is the speed of light). Only when the force is perpendicular to the velocity, Lorentz's mass is equal to what is now called \`\`relativistic mass''. Max Abraham (1902) called m L (displaystyle m_(L)) longitudinal mass and m T (displaystyle m_(T)) transverse mass (although Abraham used more complicated expressions than Lorentz's relativistic ones).

However, the motion was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations after only a brief discussion. Madison, then an opponent of a Bill of Rights, later explained the vote by calling the state bills of rights \`\`parchment barriers'' that offered only an illusion of protection against tyranny. Another delegate, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, later argued that the act of enumerating the rights of the people would have been dangerous, because it would imply that rights not explicitly mentioned did not exist; Hamilton echoed this point in Federalist No. 84. Because Mason and Gerry had emerged as opponents of the proposed new Constitution, their motion--introduced five days before the end of the convention--may also have been seen by other delegates as a delaying tactic. The quick rejection of this motion, however, later endangered the entire ratification process. Author David O.

The new piece replaces the pawn, as part of the same move. The choice of new piece is not limited to pieces previously captured , thus promotion can result in a player owning, for example, two or more queens despite starting the game with one. Pawn promotion, or the threat of it, often decides the result in an endgame. Since the queen is the most powerful piece, the vast majority of promotions are to a queen. Promotion to a queen is often called queening; promotion to any other piece is referred to as underpromotion (Golombek 1977)."},{"instruction":"here a national health service in sp","output":"The Spanish National Health System (Spanish: Sistema Nacional de Salud, SNS) is the agglomeration of public health services that has existed in Spain since it was established through and structured by the Ley General de Sanidad (the \`\`General Health Law'') of 1986.

However, this is not always the case, since cats can still break bones or die from extreme falls. In a 1987 study, published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, of 132 cats that were brought into the New York Animal Medical Center after having fallen from buildings, it was found that the injuries per cat increased depending on the height fallen up to seven stories, but decreased above seven stories. The study authors speculated that after falling five stories the cats reached terminal velocity and thereafter relaxed and spread their bodies to increase drag. However, critics of the study pointed out a survivorship bias in that instantly fatal falls were not included (as an already dead cat would not be taken to the vet), questioning the authors' conclusion that the injury rate declined for higher falls. A 2003 study of 119 cats concluded that \`\`Falls from the seventh or higher stories, are associated with more severe injuries and with a higher incidence of thoracic trauma.''"},{"instruction":"he anterior cingulate cortex in the prefrontal cortex","output":"The anterior cingulate cortex can be divided anatomically based on cognitive (dorsal), and emotional (ventral) components. The dorsal part of the ACC is connected with the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex, as well as the motor system and the frontal eye fields, making it a central station for processing top-down and bottom-up stimuli and assigning appropriate control to other areas in the brain. By contrast, the ventral part of the ACC is connected with the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and anterior insula, and is involved in assessing the salience of emotion and motivational information. The ACC seems to be especially involved when effort is needed to carry out a task, such as in early learning and problem-solving."},{"instruction":"does full employment means we are at 100 employme","output":"Full employment means that everyone who wants a job can have work hours they need on \`\`fair wages''.

In the 26-chapter book, he takes on the new name partway through chapter 2, and returns to his \`\`real'' name, Peter Rabbit, at the end of chapter 3.

This was not always the case, however: the Catholic Church has gone through several phases in kinship prohibitions. At the dawn of Christianity in Roman times, marriages between first cousins were allowed. For example, Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Roman Emperor, married his children to the children of his half-brother. First and second cousin marriages were then banned at the Council of Agde in AD 506, though dispensations sometimes continued to be granted. By the 11th century, with the adoption of the so-called canon-law method of computing consanguinity, these proscriptions had been extended even to sixth cousins, including by marriage. But due to the many resulting difficulties in reckoning who was related to whom, they were relaxed back to third cousins at the Fourth Lateran Council in AD 1215. Pope Benedict XV reduced this to second cousins in 1917, and finally, the current law was enacted in 1983.

Then in 2004, for the 2005 model year, Ford's luxury Mercury division released a rebadged version called the Mercury Mariner, sold mainly in North America. The first iteration Escape remains notable as the first SUV to offer a hybrid drivetrain option, released in 2004 for the 2005 model year to North American markets only."},{"instruction":"was frasier filmed in front of a live audience","output":"The cast had an unusual amount of freedom to suggest changes to the script. Grammer used an acting method he called \`\`requisite disrespect'' and did not rehearse with the others, instead learning and rehearsing his lines once just before filming each scene in front of a live studio audience. Although effective, the system often caused panic among guest stars. In 1996, Grammer's recurrent alcoholism led to a car accident; the cast and crew performed an intervention that persuaded him to enter the Betty Ford Clinic, delaying production for a month."},{"instruction":"an you pass your own pawn in sorry","output":"A pawn can jump over any other pawn during its move.

Germany has never granted unconditional birthright citizenship, but has traditionally used jus sanguinis, so, by giving up the requirement of at least one citizen parent, Germany has softened rather than tightened its citizenship laws; however, unlike their children born and grown up in Germany, non-EU- and non-Swiss-citizen parents born and grown up abroad usually cannot have dual citizenship themselves."},{"instruction":"e allied and north american the same company","output":"Allied Van Lines is an American moving company founded in 1928 as a cooperative non-profit organization owned by its member agents on the east coast of the United States, to help with organizing return loads and minimizing dead-heading (i.e. operating trucks without shipments loaded on them).

Interphase is the 'daily living' or metabolic phase of the cell, in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, reads its DNA, and conducts other \`\`normal'' cell functions. The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase. This phase was formerly called the resting phase. However, interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting; rather, the cell is living, and preparing for later cell division, so the name was changed. A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis.

Truman took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame. By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at Blair House from 1949 to 1951. The work, done by the firm of Philadelphia contractor John McShain, required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure. The total cost of the renovations was about 5.7 million (US54 million in 2018). Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall. Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter. The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952. While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814--1816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawed into paneling; the walls of the Vermeil Room, Library, China Room, and Map Room on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers."},{"instruction":"possible to have more than 2 nipple","output":"A supernumerary nipple (also known as a third nipple, triple nipple, accessory nipple, polythelia or the related condition: polymastia) is an additional nipple occurring in mammals, including humans.

However, goaltender Corey Crawford missed much of 2018 due to an upper-body injury. Inconsistent defense and goaltending, coupled with limited offense resulted in the team falling to the bottom of the Central Division. The Blackhawks were eliminated from playoff contention on March 20, 2018, marking the first time in nine years that the team failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The team finished the season with a 33--39--10 record and 76 points in the standings."},{"instruction":"does penny die in out of my mind","output":"Melody Brooks is an eleven-year-old girl who was born with Cerebral Palsy. Her parents have done everything they can to help her live a normal life, but life is often frustrating for Melody since she cannot speak, move, or communicate her wishes. As a result, Melody has to fight to get her wishes. At age five, Melody is even diagnosed as profoundly retarded. Despite this, Melody's mom enrolls her in Spaulding Street Elementary school to get the education she needs. However, the class she is put in is like a baby class, learning the same things every day. Melody is frustrated by this. Her neighbor, Mrs. V., is a kind, but tough woman. She pushes Melody to do the best she can. When Melody was three, Mrs. V. wasn't impressed for Melody to rely on her parents for everything. Because of this, Mrs. V. forced her to learn how to crawl and roll on the ground. She even taught Melody how to catch herself whenever she fell from her wheelchair. These things helped Melody become self-sufficient, but she continues to be reliant on her parents to help feed her and help her go to the bathroom. When Melody turns eight, her mother becomes pregnant. During this time, Melody overhears them talking about the new baby and their fears that it will suffer the same disabilities. Melody feels ashamed when she hears this. However, Melody is happy when the baby, Penny, is born perfectly healthy. Melody feels jealous as Penny grows and matures since she'll never be able to do the things Penny can do. However, Melody loves her little sister, and the pleasures Melody brings to her parents. When Melody enters fifth grade, she gets a communication device that allows her to talk with other people. At school, her new teacher starts an inclusion program that allows the special needs students to participate in the standard classes. Melody also gets an aide, Catherine, to help her. Melody befriends Rose Spencer, but is bullied by Molly and Claire, who believe that Melody's disability makes her dumber than them. Even her teacher, Mr. Dimming, believes that Melody cannot participate, but is surprised that not only does Melody join, but passes a test exam of a trivia competition with a perfect score. When he tells his class that if Melody can ace it, he is giving way too easy questions, Melody works with Ms. V in order to win the real tryouts, which she does so with a perfect score. Melody then helps the team win the qualifying competition to earn a trip to Washington D.C. for the national competition. However, on the day the group is to fly to Washington, Melody learns that her flight has been canceled due to weather, but that the rest of the team has made an earlier flight without her. Melody insists the day after the fiasco on going to school, but her mom's dismal attitude causes her to accidentally run over Penny despite Melody's attempts to warn her mother. Melody blames herself for not being able to inform her mom, even though everyone, especially Mrs. V., tells her it's not her fault. Although Melody is terrified that Penny will have a brain injury like her and be like her, she learns that Penny is going to be okay, and just has a cast on her leg. On Monday, Melody's class also apologizes for their lack of being considerate towards her by giving her their ninth place trophy, hoping to reconcile with her. However, Melody just's laughs at them and destroys the trophy by accident and says \`\`no you take it'' and heads out of the room. The next day, she and Catherine begin work on Melody's autobiography, which begins with the first few lines of the book."},{"instruction":"does george ever come back to grey's anatomy","output":"Knight auditioned for the show, expecting a one-season run.

It is visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a vertical single-column spout, typically 9 metres (30 ft) high, but reaching up to 12 metres (39 ft). Its lung capacity is 5,000 litres (1,300 US gal).

This is a tube that transfers food to the organs of digestion. In large bilaterians, the gastrointestinal tract generally also has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of feces (solid wastes). Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means (for example, through the mouth). The human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. The GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus, forming a continuous passageway that includes the main organs of digestion, namely, the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. However, the complete human digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver and gallbladder). The tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin of each segment. The whole human GI tract is about nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is considerably shorter in the living body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone in a halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention and peristalsis."},{"instruction":"e homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids the same","output":"Since homologous chromosomes are not identical and do not originate from the same organism, they are different from sister chromatids.

Originally, the winners kept it until a new champion was crowned. Currently, winning teams get the Stanley Cup during the summer and a limited number of days during the season. It is unusual among trophies to include winning members' names. Every year since 1924, a select portion of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff names are engraved on its bands. However, there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players, so some names must be omitted. Between 1924 and 1940, a new band was added almost every year the trophy was awarded, earning the nickname \`\`Stovepipe Cup'' due to the unnatural height of all the bands. In 1947 the cup size was reduced, but not all the large rings were the same size. In 1958 the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band. To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing, when the bottom band is full, the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band added to the bottom. It has been referred to as The Cup, Lord Stanley's Cup, The Holy Grail, or facetiously (chiefly by sportswriters) as Lord Stanley's Mug.

In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with \`\`carrying a concealed weapon'' and \`\`carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because \`\`the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: \`\`A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol. Although, the case of State v. Kerner helped/made more clear the allowance of openly carrying a pistol, it does not preclude all regulations regarding the carrying of firearms."},{"instruction":"he book pay it forward a true story","output":"Leslie Dixon adapted the screenplay from the book of the same name by Catherine Ryan Hyde, which was available as an open writing assignment.

In one study of clinically diagnosed brown recluse bites, skin necrosis occurred 37% of the time, while systemic illness occurred 14% of the time.

The retroactive addition of these subtitles was intended to bring the film into line with the introduction to its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, which was released in 1980 bearing the designation \`\`Episode V''. It is uncertain if the introduction of an episodic naming convention was an indicator of Lucas's original intent, or if this was simply a later redraft of the narrative.

Gary Kurtz has stated that he and Lucas had originally considered using an episode number for Star Wars to emulate the chapter numbering used in the 1936 Flash Gordon installments, but they were uncertain whether they should designate it Episode III, IV or V. However, some of Lucas's early script drafts bear titles such as \`\`The Adventures of the Starkiller (Episode One): The Star Wars'' (1975) or \`\`The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as Taken from the Journal of the Whills: Saga One: Star Wars'' (1976).

The Maryland State Police may issue a permit to carry a handgun at their discretion and based on an investigation. In practice, very few applicants are granted carry permits, and approval typically requires the applicant to provide proof of a clear and imminent threat on his or her life. For example, police reports submitted by an applicant documenting a recent assault, attempted kidnapping, carjacking, or home invasion, particularly when the assailant remains at-large, have generally been accepted as sufficient \`\`good reason'' for issuance of a carry permit. If the State Police deny the permit application, the applicant may appeal the denial to the Handgun Permit Review Board. The review board, staffed by gubernatorial appointees, has the discretion to grant or deny an appeal on a case-by-case basis. Permits are not automatically renewed, and the permit-holder must justify the continued need for the permit when applying for renewal. Out of a total population of 6 million, there were 14,298 active carry permits as of April 2014.

The advantage of this construction is that it positions the centre of mass close to the physical end of the pendulum, farthest from the pivot. This maximizes the moment of inertia, and minimises the length of pendulum required for a given period. Shorter pendulums allow the clock case to be made smaller, and also minimize the pendulum's air resistance. Since most of the energy loss in clocks is due to air friction of the pendulum, this allows clocks to run longer on a given power source."},{"instruction":"do you get an assist if player is fouled","output":"Only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist, so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal (unlike in other sports, such as ice hockey).

A New Mexico Concealed Handgun License (CHL) is required by in-state residents to carry in a concealed manner a loaded handgun while on foot. Per state law, a firearm is considered \`\`loaded'' when a magazine with live ammunition is inserted into the weapon and/or a live round is in the firing chamber. (citation needed) Additionally, state law (NMSA 29-19-2) defines a concealed handgun as \`\`a loaded handgun that is not visible to the ordinary observations of a reasonable person.'' This definition creates legal ambiguity for partially-exposed weapons, as the firearm may be visible to one person and thus no violation of law occurs since it would be viewed as open carry. However, the same partially-exposed weapon may not be readily visible to a second person, thus potentially placing the carrying person in violation of the state's concealed carry law if the individual carrying does not have a valid license for concealed carry. A CHL is not required for open carry, concealed carry of an unloaded firearm on foot, or concealed carry of a loaded or unloaded firearm while in a vehicle (including motorcycles, bicycles, off-road vehicles, motor homes, or riding a horse). An applicant for a concealed carry permit must be a resident of New Mexico and at least 21 years of age. Each permit specifies the category and caliber of handgun that may be carried, but is also valid for a smaller caliber. The applicant must complete a state approved training course that includes at least 15 hours of classroom and firing range time, and must pass a shooting proficiency test for that category and caliber of handgun. A permit is valid for four years, but license holders must pass the shooting proficiency test every two years. An applicant may appeal the denial of a Concealed Handgun License by requesting a hearing before the Department of Public Safety within 35 days of receipt of an Order of Denial for a CHL. An unfavorable ruling on the appeal by the DPS may be further appealed through the New Mexico courts. New Mexico currently recognizes concealed carry permits from or has reciprocal agreements with the following states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. New Mexico does not issue CCW permits to non-residents, except for Active Duty military members permanently assigned to a military installation within the state. Part-time residents with a valid New Mexico ID or Driver's license may apply for a New Mexico CHL. New Mexico does not recognize out-of-state nonresident permits held by in-state residents for concealed carry; in other words, New Mexico residents must hold a New Mexico CHL to lawfully carry a concealed, loaded handgun while on foot within the state."},{"instruction":"e 30 round magazines legal in north carol","output":"North Carolina is generally considered a permissive state for firearms owners, with no state-imposed restrictions on \`\`assault weapons'', no magazine capacity restrictions, no caliber restrictions, and few restrictions on the open carrying of firearms.

In this journey, Orellana baptised some of the affluents of the Amazonas like Rio Negro, Napo and Jurua.

Ties have counted as a half-win and half-loss in league standings since 1972; before that, ties were not counted in the standings at all. Since the National Hockey League eliminated ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004--05 NHL lockout, the NFL is the only one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played until there is a winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result."},{"instruction":"'t puerto rico part of the u","output":"Puerto Rico (Spanish for \`\`Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. \`\`Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida."},{"instruction":"do penalty shootout goals count for golden boo","output":"A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it.

Cornelis Van Niel proposed in 1931 that photosynthesis is a case of general mechanism where a photon of light is used to photo decompose a hydrogen donor and the hydrogen being used to reduce CO . Then in 1939, Robin Hill showed that isolated chloroplasts would make oxygen, but not fix CO showing the light and dark reactions occurred in different places. Although they are referred to as light and dark reactions, both of them take place only in the presence of light.

However, the first seat belt law was a federal law, Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, which took effect on January 1, 1968, that required all vehicles (except buses) to be fitted with seat belts in all designated seating positions. This law has since been modified to require three-point seat belts in outboard-seating positions, and finally three-point seat belts in all seating positions. Initially, seat belt use was voluntary. New York was the first state to pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts, a law that came into effect on December 1, 1984.

Small daily changes and noticeable semi-annual changes in the timing of sunsets are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. During winter and spring, the days get longer and sunsets occur later every day until the day of the latest sunset, which occurs after the summer solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere, the latest sunset occurs late in June or in early July, but not on the summer solstice of June 21. This date depends on the viewer's latitude (connected with the Earth's slower movement around the aphelion around July 4). Likewise, the earliest sunset does not occur on the winter solstice, but rather about two weeks earlier, again depending on the viewer's latitude. In the Northern Hemisphere, it occurs in early December or late November (influenced by the Earth's faster movement near its perihelion, which occurs around January 3)."},{"instruction":"true that only female ducks quack","output":"A noisy species, the female has the deep quack stereotypically associated with ducks.

Up till the 24th constitutional amendment in 1971, the fundamental rights given to the people were permanent and can not be repealed or diluted by the Parliament. 24th constitutional amendment introduced a new Article 13(4) enabling Parliament to legislate on the subjects of Part III of the constitution using its constituent powers per Article 368 (1).

It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). A boar (adult male) weighs around 350--700 kg (772--1,543 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means \`\`maritime bear'' and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals."},{"instruction":"has there ever been a hole in one on a par five","output":"Holes in one most commonly occur on par 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot.

The taste receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, the cheek and epiglottis. These structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception: salty, sour, bitter, sweet and umami; through the combination of these elements we detect \`\`flavors.'' A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves."},{"instruction":"illegal to put an engine on a bicycle","output":"The legal status of an ICE motorized bicycle in the United States is presently determined by the laws of each state and/or local jurisdiction.

Radial piston pumps used in cars and trucks are fuel lubricated, this helps with keeping oil out of the high pressure fuel. Oil in the fuel can raise emissions and clog injectors. Many diesel engines are common rail, which means all the injectors are supplied by one pipe full of high pressure fuel supplied by the fuel pump. Common rails dampen the pressure fluctuations when fuel is used by each injector and pumped into the cylinder. Common rails also make it easier for the fuel pressure to be measured by one device instead of one per cylinder. Port and Helix (plunger type) high pressure fuel pumps are most commonly used in marine diesels because of their simplicity, reliability, and its ability to be scaled up in proportion to the engine size."},{"instruction":"lake tahoe the deepest lake in the world","output":"Lake Tahoe (/ˈtɑːhoʊ/; Washo: dáʔaw) is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada of the United States.

The FDA rule also bans access to minors. A photo ID is required to buy e-cigarettes, and their sale in all-ages vending machines is not permitted. In May 2016 the FDA used its authority under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act to deem e-cigarette devices and e-liquids to be tobacco products, which meant it intended to regulate the marketing, labelling, and manufacture of devices and liquids; vape shops that mix e-liquids or make or modify devices were considered manufacturing sites that needed to register with FDA and comply with good manufacturing practice regulation.

The Portuguese first established trade with China in 1516, trading Japanese silver for Chinese silk, and after some initial hostilities gained consent from the Ming court in 1557 to settle Macau as their permanent trade base in China. Their role in providing silver was gradually surpassed by the Spanish, while even the Dutch challenged them for control of this trade. Philip IV of Spain (reigned 1621--1665) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from New Spain and Peru across the Pacific through the Philippines towards China, in favor of shipping American-mined silver through Spanish ports. In 1639 the new Tokugawa regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, cutting off another source of silver coming into China. These events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces. People began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it, forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline. In the 1630s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver; by 1640 that sum could fetch half an ounce; and, by 1643 only one-third of an ounce. For peasants this meant economic disaster, since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper."},{"instruction":"e mitochondria part of the prokaryotic cell structure","output":"A prokaryote is a unicellular organism that lacks a membrane-bound nucleus, mitochondria, or any other membrane-bound organelle.

Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate π. The digits appear to be randomly distributed. In particular, the digit sequence of π is conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness, but to date, no proof of this has been discovered. Also, π is a transcendental number; that is, a number that is not the root of any non-zero polynomial having rational coefficients. This transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge."},{"instruction":"he last stage of the tour de france a race","output":"Traditionally, the stage starts with champagne served by the race leader's team, on-the-road photo opportunities and joking around.

It is a combination of an exhaust-driven turbocharger and an engine-driven supercharger, each mitigating the weaknesses of the other. A belt-driven or shaft-driven supercharger offers exceptional response and low-rpm performance as it has no lag time between the application of throttle and pressurization of the manifold (assuming that it is a positive-displacement supercharger such as a Roots type or twin-screw and not a Centrifugal compressor supercharger, which does not provide boost until the engine has reached higher RPMs). When combined with a large turbocharger -- if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the low-rpm range -- the proper combination of the two can offer a zero-lag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end. Twincharging is therefore desirable for small-displacement motors (such as VW's 1.4TSI), especially those with a large operating rpm, since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed range."},{"instruction":"do you have to graduate to have an alma mater","output":"Alma mater (Latin: alma \`\`nourishing/kind'', mater \`\`mother''; pl.

Currently, to be classified as homegrown one must be on an English team for at least three years before the age of twenty-one in which Dyke would like to reduce to eighteen years. This would mean a teenager would have to be with the club at a maximum age of fifteen and players are not allowed to move across national boundaries, even European Union boundaries, before 16.

France is not complying with the 1991 EU directive on urban waste water treatment. The deadline for treating all wastewater covered by the directive was 31 December 2000.
