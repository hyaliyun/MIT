If Dormouse initially drank from a red cup, after each turn of the table, two red cups would be emptied. Since there are 15 red cups and 15 blue cups, if they were drinking from the same-colored cups, at the end, two cups of different colors would remain, which could not both be placed in front of the drinkers by any rotation of the table. 5. Consequently, Dormouse must have started with a blue cup. This ensures that each step of the rotation would present a full cup of the opposite color to each drinker. 6. Hence, the March Hare would always turn the table so that a new red cup is placed in front of himself, and a new blue cup is placed in front of Dormouse. Each successive step would continue this pattern until all the cups are consumed. By considering this strategy of turning the table, the March Hare can always ensure that by rotating the table after drinking from specific cups, they will still have full cups to drink from. This resolves the problem as stated, proving that even with the table being turned such that new cups are always one cup away from previously consumed ones, the entire tea can be drunk.

To find the ratio frac{|AC|^2}{|BC|^2}, we use the relationships above:    [    frac{|AC|^2}{|BC|^2} = frac{|AB| cdot |AK|}{|AB| cdot |BK|} = frac{|AK|}{|BK|} = frac{frac{4h}{5}}{frac{5h}{4}} = frac{4}{5} cdot frac{4}{5} = frac{16}{25}    ] 10.

Who exactly did each of them vote for? Given that all three brothers voted for different candidates, there are six possible scenarios: Let's denote the candidates as follows: - A = Pierre - B = Jean - C = Jacques The candidates are: - Dupont (let it be denoted as (D_1)) - Dubois (let it be denoted as (D_2)) - Duran (let it be denoted as (D_3)) Hence, the possibilities could be listed as follows: 1. A votes for (D_1), B votes for (D_2), C votes for (D_3) 2. A votes for (D_1), B votes for (D_3), C votes for (D_2) 3. A votes for (D_3), B votes for (D_1), C votes for (D_2) 4. A votes for (D_3), B votes for (D_2), C votes for (D_1) 5. A votes for (D_2), B votes for (D_3), C votes for (D_1) 6. A votes for (D_2), B votes for (D_1), C votes for (D_3) Next, consider each statement provided by the brothers. Each statement imposes constraints on voting: - **Pierre's Statements:**   - If Jean (B) votes for D_2, Pierre (A) will vote for D_1.   - If Jean (B) votes for D_3, Pierre (A) will vote for D_2.   - If Jacques (C) votes for D_1, Pierre (A) will vote for D_3.    - **Jean's Statements:**   - If Pierre (A) votes for D_3, Jean (B) will not vote for D_1.   - If Jacques (C) votes for D_2, Jean (B) will vote for D_1.    - **Jacques's Statement:**   - If Pierre (A) votes for D_1, Jacques (C) will not vote for D_3. From these statements: 1. **Rule Out Possibilities using Pierre's Statements:**    - Pierre states that if B votes for D_2, then A votes for D_1. Therefore, B voting for D_2 and A voting for D_1 are consistent.    - Pierre states that if B votes for D_3, then A votes for D_2. Therefore, B voting for D_3 and A voting for D_2 are consistent.    - Pierre states that if C votes for D_1, then A votes for D_3. Therefore, C voting for D_1 and A voting for D_3 are consistent. 2. **Rule Out Possibilities using Jean's Statements:**    - Jean states that if A votes for D_3, then B will not vote for D_1. Therefore, A voting for D_3 requires B to not vote for D_1.    - Jean states that if C votes for D_2, then B will vote for D_1. Therefore, C voting for D_2 leads B to vote for D_1. 3. **Rule Out Possibilities using Jacques's Statement:**    - Jacques states that if A votes for D_1, then C will not vote for D_3. Therefore, A voting for D_1 restricts C voting for D_3. Using these constraints, we deduce which of the six possible scenarios are valid: - **Possible Scenario 3:** A votes for (D_3), B votes for (D_1), C votes for (D_2) contradicts Jacques’s statement. - **Possible Scenario 1:** A votes for (D_1), B votes for (D_2), C votes for (D_3) contradicts Pierre's first rule. - **Possible Scenario 6:** A votes for (D_2), B votes for (D_1), C votes for (D_3) contradicts Pierre's first rule. - **Possible Scenario 4:** A votes for (D_3), B votes for (D_2), C votes for (D_1) is inconsistent with Jacques’ rule. After ruling out these possibilities, only the remaining fifth scenario:   - **Scenario 5:** A voting for (D_2), B voting for (D_3), C voting for (D_1), satisfies all the statements. # Conclusion: Given the imposed constraints and cross-references of the voting rules, the only viable voting pattern follows:   - **Pierre (A)** votes for **Dubois ((D_2))**, - **Jean (B)** votes for **Duran ((D_3))**, - **Jacques (C)** votes for **Dupont ((D_1))**.

Area of each window = 4 feet * 3 feet = 12 square feet. Total area of the three windows = 3 * 12 = 36 square feet. Total area to subtract (door + windows) = 18 + 36 = 54 square feet.

We have 0 leq M leq 3N because the range of possible sums S_i + 2S_j spans from -3N to 3N. 4. **Extending the Set**:    Extend S by defining S_{m+1} = -10N - M and S_{m+2} = 5N + M. This choice ensures that S_{m+1} + 2S_{m+2} = M, providing a solution for M. 5. **Verifying Uniqueness**:    We need to verify that adding S_{m+1} and S_{m+2} does not create any n with two different solutions. Consider:    - For any S_i in S, the sums S_{m+1} + 2S_i and S_i + 2S_{m+1} fall outside the range [-3N, 3N] due to the large magnitude of S_{m+1}.    - Similarly, the sums S_{m+2} + 2S_i and S_i + 2S_{m+2} also fall outside this range due to the large magnitude of S_{m+2}.    - Therefore, these new sums do not interfere with existing sums or each other. 6. **Handling Negative Integers**:    For negative integers M without solutions, we can similarly define S_{m+1} = 10N - M and S_{m+2} = -5N + M to ensure S_{m+1} + 2S_{m+2} = M. 7. **Generalization**:    This process can be repeated for any integer M that lacks a solution in S. By continually adding appropriate pairs (S_{m+1}, S_{m+2}), we can ensure every integer n has exactly one solution to a + 2b = n with a, b in S. 8. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, there does exist a subset X of the integers such that for any integer n, there is exactly one solution to a + 2b = n with a, b in X.  boxed{text{Yes, such a subset exists.}}"},{"instruction":"wo integers are in the ratio of 1 to 4 . if 6 is added to the smaller number , the ratio becomes 1 to 2 . find the larger integer .","output":"Let's denote the smaller integer as ( x ) and the larger integer as ( 4x ) since they are in the ratio of 1 to 4.

A function is symmetric with respect to a line if reflecting the graph of the function over the line leaves the graph unchanged.  Step 1: Symmetry Analysis 1. **Vertical Asymptote Consideration:**    - The function ( y = 2^x ) has a horizontal asymptote ( y = 0 ).     - If the graph were symmetric with respect to a line ( y = k ), reflecting the horizontal asymptote would necessitate another asymptote. Since the function ( y = 2^x ) has no other horizontal asymptotes, this reflection can only map ( y = 0 ) onto itself. 2. **Vertical lines consideration ( x = c ):**    - Suppose ( x = c ) is a line of symmetry. If this were true, ( y = 2^x ) should satisfy the relation where:      [      2^c quad text{is a point of symmetry}      ]      However, due to the exponential nature of the function ( y = 2^x ) and its unbounded growth, no single vertical line can satisfy the symmetry condition globally for all ( x ).  Step 2: Testing Candidate Symmetry Axes 1. **Line ( y = k ):**    - Reflecting ( y = 2^x ) over ( y = k ) should persist ( y = 2^x ).     - Since ( y = 0 ) maps to ( y = 0 ) under reflection, this implies potential vertical or horizontal symmetry. 2. **Testing ( y=0 ):**    - The line ( y=0 ) (the x-axis) is not a line of symmetry because the function ( y = 2^x ) is not symmetric around the x-axis (as (2^x neq 2^{-x} )). 3. **Testing any vertical line ( x = c ):**    - If ( x = c ) were the line of symmetry, then ( f(x) = 2^x ) and ( f(2c - x) = 2^{2c-x} ) must satisfy ( 2^x = 2^{2c-x} ), which implies ( x = 2c - x ), leading to ( x = c ). But, it needs true for all x, ( 2^x neq 2^{2c-x} ), breaking symmetry. # Conclusion: There does not exist any line of symmetry for the graph of the function ( y = 2^x ).

The total number of arrangements of 2n people is given by the factorial:    [    (2n)!    ] 3. Each pair is considered identical regardless of the order within the pair and among pairs. Therefore, for each pair of 2 persons, there are 2 ways to choose and n pairs overall. So, we divide by 2^n because each of the n pairs can be ordered in 2 ways (pairs are unordered):    [    2^n    ] 4.

Using the method from part (a), the total number of ways to arrange nk people is:    [    (nk)!    ] 3. The number of ways to arrange k people within each group (since order within groups doesn’t matter) is:    [    (k!)^n    ] 4. Since the order between different groups also doesn't matter, we must divide by n!:    [    n!    ] 5.

The maximum area of triangle PAB is given when P is at the vertex of the short axis, which is ab=2. 2. The eccentricity of the ellipse is given as frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, leading to frac{c}{a}=frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. 3. Using the relation c^2=a^2-b^2 to relate the semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b, and the distance c from the center to the foci.

The discriminant Delta = 16(t^{2}+4-n^{2}) > 0 implies n^{2} < t^{2}+4. Using Vieta's formulas, we find: [ begin{aligned} y_1+y_2 &= -frac{2tn}{t^2+4},  y_1y_2 &= frac{n^2-4}{t^2+4}. end{aligned} ] From frac{k_1}{k_2}=frac{2-n}{2+n}=frac{5}{3}, we deduce n=-frac{1}{2}.

Since the diameter of the cylinder is given as 9 m, the radius ( r ) is half of that, which is ( frac{9}{2} = 4.5 ) m. The area of one circular base is: [ A_{base} = pi r^2 = pi (4.5)^2 = pi times 20.25 ] Since there are two bases, we multiply this area by 2: [ A_{total_bases} = 2 times A_{base} = 2 times pi times 20.25 ] The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula ( A_{lateral} = 2pi rh ), where ( h ) is the height of the cylinder.

The principle asserts that if more items are put into fewer containers, then at least one container must contain more than one item. 1. **Setup and Total Pairs Calculation**:     - We have 4 girls and 8 boys.     - Each photo can feature one of three combinations: two boys, two girls, or one boy and one girl.     - Suppose, hypothetically, there are no photos of only boys or only girls, and no duplicate photos of the same pair of children (whether mixed gender or not).     - Let's count the number of unique boy-girl pairs:       [       text{Number of boy-girl pairs} = 4 text{ girls} times 8 text{ boys} = 32       ]       Therefore, if every possible boy-girl pair is used exactly once, we would have 32 unique photos featuring distinct boy-girl pairs. 2. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**:     - According to the pigeonhole principle, if you try to add even one more photo (i.e., a 33rd photo) under these conditions, you are forced into a situation where either:         - A pair of boys, or a pair of girls must be photographed together.         - The same boy-girl pair must be photographed again.     - This follows because there are only 32 unique boy-girl combinations, and any additional photo beyond these 32 will necessarily repeat one of the previous pair configurations (either a particular boy-girl pair or create a new configuration with two boys or two girls). 3. **Conclusion**:     - Thus, to ensure that the condition (having a photo of only boys, only girls, or a duplicate of a previously taken pair) is guaranteed, the minimum number of photographs required is 33.

Given a positive integer ( n ), if we repeatedly take the product of its digits until we get a single-digit number, this final single-digit number is the digital root of ( n ).  2. **Characteristics of ( R_k )**:    Define ( R_k ) as the number formed by ( k ) digits of 1. For example, ( R_1 = 1 ), ( R_2 = 11 ), ( R_3 = 111 ), etc. Clearly, if ( p(m) = 1 ), it implies that all the digits of ( m ) must be 1 because the product of any digits other than 1 would exceed 1. 3. **Check for ( p(n) = R_k ) for ( k geq 2 )**:    We need to show that if ( k > 1 ), ( p(n) ) cannot be equal to ( R_k ).

Consequently, for any ( k ), the sum of ( k ) ones is ( k times 1 = k ) and must be divisible by 3. Hence, ( k ) must be a multiple of 3, say ( k = 3m ). 7. **Prime Factor of 37 in ( R_k )**:    If ( k ) is a multiple of 3, ( R_k ) is divisible by 111, which is ( 3 times 37 ). However, since ( R_k ) cannot be divisible by 37 (a prime number not represented by single digits), ( n )'s digits must be 1 or 7 for any possible ( k ). 8. **Powers of 7**:    If ( R_k ) must be a power of 7, examine whether ( R_k ) is made of powers of 7:    - ( R_1 = 1 )    - ( R_2 = 11 neq 7 )    - ( R_3 = 111 neq 7 )    - ( R_4 = 1111 neq 7 )    - ( R_5 = 11111 neq 7 )    - ( R_6 = 111111 ) is divisible by 7.    Thus, if ( R_k ) is divisible by 7, then ( k ) must be a multiple of 6 (from modular representation of ( R_k ) as ( R_1, R_2, ldots, R_6 )). 9. **Combined Contradiction**:    Given ( k ) being a multiple of 6 implies ( R_k ) would also be divisible by 3 (since 6 is a multiple of 3), which contradicts the earlier statement that ( R_k ) doesn't include digits divisible by 3 or 9.

To prove that the first 1024 positive integers can be divided into two parts, each containing 512 elements ( (x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{512}) ) and ( (y_{1}, y_{2}, ldots, y_{512}) ), so that for every natural number ( j < 10 ), the following equality holds:     [     x_{1}^{j} + x_{2}^{j} + ldots + x_{512}^{j} = y_{1}^{j} + y_{2}^{j} + ldots + y_{512}^{j}     ] 2. It is more convenient to prove the assertion for the first 1024 non-negative integers. This follows by noting that if the assertion holds for some numbers ( (x_{i}, y_{i}, i=1,2, ldots,512) ) for all ( j < 10 ), then it also holds for:     [     bar{x}_{i} = x_{i} + 1, quad bar{y}_{i} = y_{i} + 1, quad i = 1, 2, ldots, 512     ] 3. First, rewrite the powers in the expanded form. For example, for ( j )-th power:     [     bar{x}_{i}^{j} = (x_{i} + 1)^j = sum_{k=0}^{j} binom{j}{k} x_{i}^{k}     ]     Each term in this binomial expansion contains ( x_{i}^{k} ) where ( k leq j < 10 ). Therefore, applying the given condition for each integer ( j ) on the expanded terms proves the assertion for ( bar{x}_{i}, bar{y}_{i} ). 4. Represent the first 1024 non-negative integers in binary form:     [     2^9 e_9 + 2^8 e_8 + ldots + e_0     ]     where each ( e_k ) is either 0 or 1. Partition them based on the sum of their digits in binary form being even or odd. 5. To find the j-th power, compute:     [     (2^9 e_9 + 2^8 e_8 + ldots + e_0)(2^9 e_9 + 2^8 e_8 + ldots + e_0) ldots (2^9 e_9 + 2^8 e_8 + ldots + e_0)     ] 6. On expanding, there are ( 10^j ) partial results, where each result is based on ( j ) terms. Given ( j < 10 ), each term involves fewer than 10 digits from the binary representations. The parity (even/odd sum of digits) dictates these results, thus validating the equality condition across both partitions. 7. To formalize, use proof by induction:     - **Base Case**: For ( n=1 ) (sufficient for working with 4 elements), validate:         [         x_{1}=1, x_{2}=4, y_{1}=2, y_{2}=3         ]         for any first-degree polynomial ( p(x) = ax + b ):         [         p(1) + p(4) = 5a + 2b = p(2) + p(3)         ]     - **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement for ( n geq 1 ). For the first ( 4m ) positive integers, partition as:         [         (x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{m}, y_{1} + 2m, ldots, y_{m} + 2m)         ]         and          [         (y_{1}, y_{2}, ldots, y_{m}, x_{1} + 2m, ldots, x_{m} + 2m)         ]         For any polynomial ( p(x) ) of degree at most ( n+1 ), use ( q(x) = p(x + 2m) - p(x) ) (degree at most ( n )):         [         q(x_{1}) + q(x_{2}) + ldots + q(x_{m}) = q(y_{1}) + q(y_{2}) + ldots + q(y_{m})         ]         Rearrange the terms to validate the equality. 8. Hence, our proof by induction confirms the partition satisfying:     [     p(x_{1}) + ldots + p(x_{m}) + p(y_{1} + 2m) + ldots + p(y_{m} + 2m) = p(y_{1}) + ldots + p(y_{m}) + p(x_{1} + 2m) + ldots + p(x_{m} + 2m)     ] Conclusion: [ blacksquare ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=x^{3}x^{2}2a, if there exists x_{0}in(infty,a] such that f(x_{0})geqslant 0, then the range of the real number a is ______.","output":"Since the function is f(x)=x^{3}-x^{2}-2a,   then f'(x)=3x^{2}-2x.

(operatorname{ggT}(a, 20) = b) 2. (operatorname{ggT}(b, 15) = c) 3. (operatorname{ggT}(a, c) = 5) We need to find all triples ((a, b, c)) of positive integers that satisfy these conditions.  Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Condition** (operatorname{ggT}(a, 20) = b):     - Since (b) is the greatest common divisor of (a) and 20, (b) must be a divisor of 20. Possible values of (b) are thus (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20). 2. **Condition** (operatorname{ggT}(b, 15) = c):     - Since (c) is the greatest common divisor of (b) and 15, (c) must be a divisor of both (b) and 15. The divisors of 15 are (1, 3, 5, 15). 3. **Condition** (operatorname{ggT}(a, c) = 5):     - Since (c) must also be a common divisor of (a) and satisfy (operatorname{ggT}(a, c) = 5), (c) must be (5). This restricts (b) to include 5. Combining these insights, we analyze the scenarios: # Case Analysis: - **Case (a)**: (a) is an odd multiple of 5 but not a multiple of 10:     - (a = 5k) where (k) is odd.     - From (operatorname{ggT}(a, 20) = b), ( operatorname{ggT}(5k, 20) = 5) because (k) is odd.     - This gives (b = 5).     - From (operatorname{ggT}(b, 15) = c), ( operatorname{ggT}(5, 15) = 5).     - This gives (c = 5).   So the possible triple is ((a, b, c) = (5k, 5, 5)) where (k) is odd. - **Case (b)**: (a) is a multiple of 10 but not 20:     - (a = 10m) where (m) is odd.     - From (operatorname{ggT}(a, 20) = b), ( operatorname{ggT}(10m, 20) = 10).     - This gives (b = 10).     - From (operatorname{ggT}(b, 15) = c), ( operatorname{ggT}(10, 15) = 5).     - This gives (c = 5).   So the possible triple is ((a, b, c) = (10m, 10, 5)) where (m) is odd. - **Case (c)**: (a) is a multiple of 20:     - (a = 20n) where (n) is any positive integer.     - From (operatorname{ggT}(a, 20) = b), ( operatorname{ggT}(20n, 20) = 20).     - This gives (b = 20).     - From (operatorname{ggT}(b, 15) = c), ( operatorname{ggT}(20, 15) = 5).     - This gives (c = 5).

To find the range of f(x), we first identify that the vertex of this parabola is at x = 0 and the corresponding y-value is f(0) = -2. As the parabola opens downward, the maximum value of f(x) is -2. We next find the minimum value of f(x) on the given interval. Evaluating f(x) at the endpoints of the interval, we get: f(-2) = -3(-2)^2 - 2 = -14, f(2) = -3(2)^2 - 2 = -14. Thus, the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [-1, 2] is -14. Therefore, the range of f(x) is boxed{[-14, -2]}."},{"instruction":"Through the focus of the parabola y^2 = 2px (p > 0), a line intersects the parabola at points P and Q.

By the definition of the parabola, the length of segment PQ, which is the distance between points P and Q, can be expressed as the sum of the distances from P to F and from Q to F, i.e., |PQ| = |PF| + |QF|. Since F is the focus of the parabola, it has coordinates (frac{p}{2},0). Let the coordinates of P and Q be (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), respectively. Using the definition of a parabola, the distances from P and Q to F are |x_1 - frac{p}{2}| and |x_2 - frac{p}{2}|. Because P and Q lie on the parabola y^2 = 2px, their x-coordinates x_1 and x_2 are the roots of the parabola's equation, i.e., y^2 - 2px = 0. Hence, the sum of their x-coordinates is equal to the x-coordinate of the midpoint of PQ, which is 3. So we have: |PQ| = left|x_1 - frac{p}{2}right| + left|x_2 - frac{p}{2}right| = (x_1 + x_2) + p. Since the midpoint of PQ has an x-coordinate of 3, and x_1 + x_2 = 2 cdot 3 due to the midpoint formula, from which we can obtain that x_1 + x_2 = 6. Given that |PQ| = 10, we can set up the equation: 10 = 6 + p. Solving for p, we get: p = 10 - 6 = 4. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is: y^2 = 2px = 2 cdot 4x = 8x.

The number 97 must include the 14 cakes he made plus additional cakes that were not initially mentioned. So, we need to correct the number of cakes sold to reflect the actual number he made: 97 cakes sold - 14 cakes made = 83 additional cakes Now, we can set up the equation to find out how many pastries Baker made: Number of cakes sold - Number of pastries sold = 89 (14 + additional cakes) - P = 89 We already found that the additional cakes are 83, so we can substitute that into the equation: (14 + 83) - P = 89 97 - P = 89 Now, we solve for P: P = 97 - 89 P = 8 Therefore, Baker made boxed{8}  pastries."},{"instruction":"A circular disc is divided into  12  equal sectors and one of  6  different colours is used to colour each sector.

Prove that triangle (ABC) is equilateral.","output":"To prove that triangle ABC is equilateral if four of the circles inscribed into the triangles formed by its medians are equal, we perform the following steps: 1. **Divide Triangle ABC:**    The medians of triangle ABC divide it into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these six small triangles Delta is given by:    [    S_{Delta} = frac{1}{6} S_{triangle ABC}.    ] 2. **Equality of Radii and Perimeters:**    Given that the radii of the incircles of four of these small triangles are equal, we use the formula:    [    S = p cdot r,    ]    where S is the area, p is the semi-perimeter, and r is the inradius of the triangle.    Since the areas of the six small triangles are equal and some of their inradii are also equal, it implies that the semi-perimeters of these triangles must be the same. 3. **Analyze Specific Small Triangles:**    Consider two small triangles that share a side, such as triangle ALM and triangle AKM, formed by the median from A and sides AM and AK respectively.    Since these triangles are adjacent:    [    text{Perimeter of } triangle ALM = AL + LM + MA,    ]    [    text{Perimeter of } triangle AKM = AK + KM + MA.    ]    Since the inradii are equal, so:    [    AL + LM + MA = AK + KM + MA.    ] 4. **Equality of Side Lengths:**    As M is the midpoint of BC, thus AM is both a median and an angle bisector, and LM = MB = MK (each being segments from M to the sides of triangle ABC). 5. **Implication on Entire Triangle:**    Further, if the side lengths and perimeters are consistently equal for these smaller triangles, it follows that the sides opposite the equal angles are equal.     If AL = AK, BM = CM, and given median properties in an equilateral setup, therefore AB = AC = BC. Specifically, since the equal distances simplify tracing all sides, this triangulation symmetry implies that triangle ABC must be equilateral. 6. **Summarizing:**    The equality of the inradii and the semi-perimeter corresponding implications across the division by medians systematically establish throughout the symmetric equalities found across multiple triangles sharing consistent properties of incircle and symmetry as seen above. 7. **Conclusion:**    Hence, triangle ABC must indeed be equilateral.

Abel also stops for a break of 30 minutes during the trip. Meanwhile, Alice leaves an hour later, traveling at a speed of 40 mph. However, 150 miles into her journey, she faces a roadblock due to construction work and has to take a detour, adding 30 miles to her trip. Her speed remains constant throughout the journey.

Abel's journey can be divided into three parts: 1. The first 200 miles at 50 mph 2. The next 100 miles at 40 mph due to rain 3. The remaining distance at 50 mph For the first part: Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 50 mph = 4 hours For the second part: Time = Distance / Speed = 100 miles / 40 mph = 2.5 hours For the third part, we need to calculate the remaining distance. Abel has already covered 200 + 100 = 300 miles. So the remaining distance is 1000 - 300 = 700 miles. Time = Distance / Speed = 700 miles / 50 mph = 14 hours Now, we add the times for all parts and the break: Total time for Abel = 4 hours + 2.5 hours + 14 hours + 0.5 hours (30 minutes break) = 21 hours Now let's calculate the time it takes for Alice to reach the destination. Alice's journey is affected by a detour that adds 30 miles to her trip, making her total distance 1000 + 30 = 1030 miles. Since Alice travels at a constant speed of 40 mph: Time = Distance / Speed = 1030 miles / 40 mph = 25.75 hours Alice leaves an hour later than Abel, so we need to subtract that hour from her travel time to compare their arrival times: Total time for Alice = 25.75 hours - 1 hour = 24.75 hours Now, let's find the difference in their arrival times: Difference in time = Total time for Alice - Total time for Abel = 24.75 hours - 21 hours = 3.75 hours To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: Difference in time in minutes = 3.75 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 225 minutes Abel reaches the destination boxed{225}  minutes earlier than Alice."},{"instruction":"A school wanted to understand the study situation of senior three students during the winter vacation, so they surveyed 100 students, recording their average daily study time and plotted it as a frequency distribution histogram.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation: P + N = 5  (since both prices are integers) From the second piece of information, we can write the equation: 21P + 15N = 93 Now we have a system of two equations with two variables: 1) P + N = 5 2) 21P + 15N = 93 We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

Notice that triangle triangle ABD is congruent to triangle triangle EBD by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence theorem because:    - BD is a common side,    - AD = DE as ADE is isosceles,    - AB = BE due to the equality of triangles triangle ABC and triangle EBD. 4. Consequently, angle DAB = angle BED and angle ABD = angle DBE. 5. Hence, angle ABD = angle DBE = angle ABE = frac{1}{3} times 360^circ = 120^circ as each triangle should add up to the complete circle around point B. 6. Since AB = BE, triangle ABE is isosceles with an angle of 120^circ, making angle BAE = frac{1}{2} left(180^circ - 120^circ right) = 30^circ. 7. Therefore, we find:    [    angle BAC = angle DAB = angle DAE - angle BAE = 37^circ - 30^circ = 7^circ    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{7^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"takes John 13 seconds to run 100 meters.

It turns out that for any eight distinct numbers from the board, there exists a ninth number on the board, different from them, such that the sum of these nine numbers is an integer. For which N is this possible?","output":"1. **Problem Interpretation:** We start by understanding the problem. We have N geq 9 distinct non-negative numbers less than one written on the board. For any selection of eight different numbers from the board, there exists a ninth number such that the sum of these nine numbers is an integer. We are to determine for which values of N this is possible. 2. **Special Case for N=9:**    - For N=9, the condition is possible. This is because we can construct nine distinct positive numbers that sum up to one. Writing nine distinct positive numbers with a unit sum ensures that their combined total can facilitate integer-valued sums for any selection of eight from these nine numbers. 3. **General Case Analysis for N>9:**    - Suppose for contradiction that the requirement holds for N > 9.    - Let S be the sum of all numbers on the board.    - Select any seven numbers alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, ldots, alpha_{7} with their sum T. Let A be the set of all remaining numbers on the board. 4. **Key Property:**    - According to the problem, for any number beta in A, there exists a different number gamma in A such that the sum T + beta + gamma is an integer.    - Denote by (beta, gamma) the corresponding pair of numbers. 5. **Uniqueness Verification:**    - If there exists another number gamma' in A such that T + beta + gamma' is an integer, then the difference gamma - gamma' must also be an integer implying (0 < |gamma - gamma'| < 1). This is impossible as no difference between distinct numbers in A can be a proper fraction of the form frac{k}{l-1} with k and l integers. 6. **Structuring Pairs:**    - Hence, every number beta has a unique gamma, and all numbers in A can be partitioned into pairs (beta_1, gamma_1), (beta_2, gamma_2), ldots, (beta_l, gamma_l). Here l must be such that 7 + 2l > 9, hence l geq 2. 7. **Summation Argument:**    - Consider the sum Sigma = (T + beta_1 + gamma_1) + (T + beta_2 + gamma_2) + ldots + (T + beta_l + gamma_l). Sigma is an integer.    - Since each number beta and gamma appears exactly once, Sigma = lT + (S-T).    - Therefore, T = frac{Sigma - S}{l-1} is rational. 8. **Invariance of T:**    - Recalling T for an arbitrary selection alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_8, we similarly get T' = frac{Sigma' - S}{l-1} for another sum Sigma'. Then, alpha_i - alpha_j = frac{Sigma - Sigma'}{l-1} shows the difference must always be a fraction of frac{1}{l-1}. 9. **Conclusion:**    - Since the minimal number mu must fit in a series of increments mu, mu + frac{1}{l-1}, ldots, mu + frac{l-2}{l-1}, having no unique larger number not less than 1, implying we cannot have N = 7 + 2l > l while maintaining distinctiveness among greater than 9 numbers. Thus a contradiction occurs. 10. **Summary:**    - Consequently, the problem condition is only satisfied when N = 9 and no higher N can fit all given conditions as having >9 would force a repetition in modular fractions contradicting the distinctiveness stipulated. **Conclusion:**  [ boxed{N=9} ]"},{"instruction":"Each of two boxes contains both black and white marbles, and the total number of marbles in the two boxes is 30.

The length of the chord that the asymptote intersects from circle C: (x-1)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 9 is equal to 4. The distance from the center of the circle to the line is: frac{|b pm 3a|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}.

First Solution: 1. **Analyze Points and Radii:**    Among the 8 points, consider at least 7 of them which are distinct points other than the circle's center. When connecting these points to the center, they define radii within the circle. 2. **Case Analysis of Radii:**     - **First Case: Overlapping Radii:**       If not all these radii are distinct, there exist two points on the same radius. Therefore, the distance between these two points is less than the radius of the circle (since both are on the same line segment from the center).     - **Second Case: All Radii Distinct:**       If all radii are distinct, they divide the entire circle’s angle (360°) into at least 7 parts. 3. **Angle Calculation:**    The angle between two of these radii will be less than ( frac{360°}{6} = 60° ) since only 6 segments cover 360° at most. 4. **Triangle and Distance:**    Consider points ( A ) and ( B ) on these two radii with ( angle AOB < 60° ), forming triangle ( AOB ).     - Based on the properties of triangles, the largest angle in ( triangle AOB ) is less than 60°.     - According to the triangle inequality and the properties of opposite angles and sides, side ( AB ) must be smaller than either ( OA ) or ( OB ). 5. **Conclusion of Distance:**    Since ( OA ) and ( OB ) are radii of the circle, and side ( AB ) is smaller than ( OA ) or ( OB ), we have ( AB < R ), where ( R ) is the radius of the circle.

The circle can be divided into 7 regions by using the 6 radii leading to the vertices of this hexagon and their midpoints (as shown in figure 2). 2. **Properties of Divided Regions:**    Each of these 7 regions can be fitted within circles whose diameters are equal to the radius ( R ) of the original circle.  3. **Placement of Points:**    Rotate this division such that none of the 8 given points lie on the dividing lines. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these 7 regions must contain at least two of the 8 points. 4. **Distance Calculation within Each Region:**    Any two points within one of these regions are contained in a smaller circle with a diameter less than ( R ). Therefore, their distance must be less than ( R ), the original circle's radius.

Since the quadrilateral is convex, point M lies within the quadrilateral. We are also given that the quadrilateral is divided into four triangles, each having equal perimeters. 2. **Assumption and Initial Analysis:**    Let's assume M does not bisect the diagonal BD, implying M is closer to D than B. Under this assumption:    - Either vertex A or vertex C must not lie on the perpendicular bisector of BD. If both vertices lay on the perpendicular bisector, M would have to be the midpoint of BD, contradicting our assumption. 3. **Contradiction with Perimeter Argument:**    - Assume A lies on or closer to the D side of the perpendicular bisector of BD. This implies MD < MB and DA leq BA. Thus, the perimeter of triangle MDA would be:      [      MD + DA + AM < MB + BA + AM      ]      This inequality suggests the perimeter of triangle MDA is less than the perimeter of triangle MBA, which contradicts our assumption that all four triangles have equal perimeters. 4. **Implication for Diagonal BD:**    - Therefore, the contradiction implies that point M must bisect diagonal BD. By a similar argument, M must also bisect diagonal AC. 5. **Conclusion of Bisection Leads to Parallelogram:**    - Since both diagonals are bisected by M, quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram by definition (diagonals bisect each other in a parallelogram). 6. **Equality of Adjacent Sides in Parallelogram:**    - Let the sides of the parallelogram be a and b, and the lengths of the halves of the diagonals be e and f respectively.    - Given that the perimeters of triangles formed by the diagonals are the same:      [      a + e + f = b + e + f      ]      Simplifying, we obtain:      [      a = b      ]    - Thus, the parallelogram has all sides equal, which confirms it is a rhombus. 7. **Verification with Rhombus Properties:**    - Any rhombus is divided by its diagonals into four congruent triangles.

The main goal is to prove that there is a point ( Q ) such that for any interior point ( D ) of the polygon, the line segment ( QD ) lies entirely within the polygon. 1. **Formation of the Lines and Semiplanes:**    - Let ( T ) be a non-self-intersecting closed broken line, and let ( S ) be the polygon it encloses. For each side ( a ) of ( T ), consider the semiplane ( F(a) ) determined by the line containing ( a ) that includes the point inside ( S ) closest to the midpoint of ( a ).    - Denote the semiplane ( F_d(a) ) as the region that contains ( F(a) ) and is parallel to ( a ) at a distance ( d ) (positive). 2. **Existence of a Common Point in ( F_d(a) ), ( F_d(b) ), and ( F_d(c) ):**    - We need to show that for any three arbitrary sides ( a, b, ) and ( c ) and any positive distance ( d ), the semiplanes ( F_d(a) ), ( F_d(b) ), and ( F_d(c) ) have a common point.    - Let ( A_0 ) be the midpoint of side ( A' A'' ). Since ( S ) is a closed polygon, there exists a circle ( K ) with center ( A_0 ) and radius ( r ) such that ( A' A'' / 2 leq r ), fully containing ( S ).    - The intersections of circle ( K ) with line ( F_d(a) ) are denoted as points ( D ) and ( E ). Let ( G ) be the intersection of lines ( DA' ) and ( A''E ). If we choose ( r ) sufficiently large, ( DE > A'A'' ), putting ( G ) inside ( F(a) ). 3. **Proof that a Point ( P ) Exists for Each Semiplane Intersection without Contradiction:**    - For point ( P ) inside ( S ), if the segment ( PA ) doesn’t intersect the side ( A'A'' ), then ( P ) lies within the semiplane ( F_d(a) ). By construction, ( P ) is such that ( PA ) does not intersect ( a ).    - Similarly, we can find points ( B ) and ( C ) for sides ( b ) and ( c ) respectively, and find a common point ( P ) such that segments ( PB ) and ( PC ) do not intersect the sides ( b ) and ( c ) respectively.    - Thus, ( P ) must exist such that it lies within the intersection of ( F_d(a) ), ( F_d(b) ), and ( F_d(c) ) as assumed. 4. **Application of Helly’s Theorem:**    - It can be concluded by Helly’s theorem[^0] that if three arbitrary semiplanes intersect, the family of all such semiplanes ( F_d(a) ) have a common intersection point.    - The common point ( Q ) obtained satisfies the requirements: for any interior point ( D ) of the polygon ( S ), the segment ( QD ) fully lies inside ( S ). 5. **Verifying the Position and Intersection:**    - To ensure ( Q ) indeed satisfies the condition, consider line ( e ) containing ( Q ). By the nature of the intersection with the polygon, any line segment ( AB ) where ( A ), ( B ), and ( Q ) are points on the segment entails all other points on ( AB ) lying inside ( S ). 6. **Conclusion:**    - The point ( Q ) determined in step 4 fulfills the objective, ensuring any segment ( QD ) lies within ( S ), thereby proving the statement of the problem.

Necessary Condition: For a triangle to be obtuse, one of its angles must be greater than 90^circ. Without loss of generality, assume the remaining two angles are acute, and denote them by alpha and beta.  In any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180^circ, hence: alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ, where gamma is the obtuse angle, so  gamma > 90^circ. Thus, alpha + beta < 90^circ.  2. Tangent of the Sum of Two Angles: Consider the tangent of the sum of two acute angles alpha and beta. The tangent addition formula states: tan(alpha + beta) = frac{tan alpha + tan beta}{1 - tan alpha cdot tan beta}. For alpha + beta < 90^circ, tan(alpha + beta) will be positive.  3. Sign of the Tangent Expression: Given tan alpha > 0 and tan beta > 0 (since alpha and beta are acute angles), the sign of the fraction: frac{tan alpha + tan beta}{1 - tan alpha cdot tan beta} depends on the denominator 1 - tan alpha cdot tan beta. For tan(alpha + beta) to be positive, it is necessary that: 1 - tan alpha cdot tan beta > 0, which simplifies to: tan alpha cdot tan beta < 1.  4. Sufficiency Condition: If tan alpha cdot tan beta < 1, then the denominator of the tangent addition formula is positive, ensuring tan(alpha + beta) remains positive. This positivity implies: alpha + beta < 90^circ.  Conclusion: Therefore, we have shown: - If a triangle is obtuse, alpha + beta < 90^circ, so tan alpha cdot tan beta < 1. - If tan alpha cdot tan beta < 1, then alpha + beta < 90^circ, implying the triangle is obtuse.

Prove that if in the initial position pawns fill a  3k times n  rectangle, then it is impossible to reach a position with only one pawn on the board.","output":"1. **Define the Coordinate System and Labeling:**    We start by defining a coordinate system on the infinite chessboard. Each field on the chessboard is labeled with coordinates ((i, j)). We then label each field ((i, j)) with (i + j pmod{3}). This means each field will be labeled with one of the numbers (0, 1,) or (2). 2. **Initial Distribution of Labels:**    In the initial position, pawns fill a (3k times n) rectangle. Since the rectangle has dimensions (3k times n), it contains (3kn) fields. Each field is labeled with (0, 1,) or (2) based on the sum of its coordinates modulo 3. Since the rectangle is (3k) rows high, each row will have an equal number of fields labeled (0, 1,) and (2). Therefore, there will be exactly (kn) fields labeled with each of (0, 1,) and (2). 3. **Effect of a Move on Labels:**    An allowed move in the game involves removing two adjacent pawns and placing one of them on the next field. This move affects three fields that lie on a vertical or horizontal line. Suppose the fields involved in the move are labeled (a, b,) and (c) respectively. The move removes pawns from fields labeled (a) and (b) and places a pawn on the field labeled (c). Since (a, b,) and (c) are consecutive fields, they must satisfy (a + b + c equiv 0 pmod{3}). This means that the move removes one pawn from each of two different labels and adds one pawn to the third label. 4. **Parity of Labels:**    Since each move removes one pawn from two different labels and adds one pawn to the third label, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of pawns labeled (0, 1,) and (2) remains unchanged. Initially, there are (kn) pawns labeled (0), (kn) pawns labeled (1), and (kn) pawns labeled (2). All these numbers are even if (k) and (n) are integers. 5. **Final Position Analysis:**    To reach a position with only one pawn on the board, the number of pawns labeled (0, 1,) and (2) must change such that two of these numbers become zero and one becomes one. However, this is impossible because the parity of the number of pawns labeled (0, 1,) and (2) must remain the same throughout the game. Since we start with even numbers of pawns for each label, we cannot end up with exactly one pawn (which would imply an odd number for one label and zero for the others).

The maximum sum of the digits of a three-digit number is (9 + 9 + 9 = 27). 3. **Possible sums of digits and examples:**     Let's consider the possible sums of the digits for the two multiples of 9 in the sequence:     - The possible sums of digits are 9, 18, and 27.          Consider the following cases and examples:     **Case (i): Sums are 9 and 9**          - Example sequence: (144, 153, ldots )     - Here (144) has a sum of digits (1+4+4=9), and (135) or (153) has a sum of digits (1+3+5=9) or (1+5+3=9).     **Case (ii): Sums are 9 and 18**          - Example sequence: (891, 900, ldots )     - Here (900) has a sum of digits (9+0+0=9), and (891) or (909) has a sum of digits (8+9+1=18) or (9+0+9=18).     **Case (iii): Sums are 18 and 18**          - Example sequence: (819, 828, ldots )     - Here (828) has a sum of digits (8+2+8=18), and (819) or (837) has a sum of digits (8+1+9=18) or (8+3+7=18).     **Case (iv): Sums are 18 and 27**          - Example sequence: (999)     - Here (999) has a sum of digits (9+9+9=27). 4. **Verification:**     For each possible sum of digits (9, 18, and 27), at least one of the sums is a divisor of the corresponding number:          - In case (i), both sums of 9 are equal to 9, thus (144) or (153) is divisible by 9.     - In case (ii), one sum is 9 (900, divisible by 9), the other 18 (891 or 909, one divisible by 18).     - In case (iii), both sums are 18, hence one number must be even (each multiple of 18, as 18 is a common divisor of 2 and 9).     - In case (iv), the sum is 27 (only possible for 999, divisible by 27). Conclusion: Since at least one number in every sequence of 18 consecutive three-digit numbers is divisible by the sum of its digits, we have shown that the statement is true.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Albert's father was 48 years of age when she was born, while her mother was 46 years old when her brother, who is 2 years younger than her, was born.

Divide 3x^2 by x to get 3x. 2. Multiply 3x times (x - 2) to get 3x^2 - 6x. 3. Subtract (3x^2 - 6x) from the numerator (3x^2 + 5x - 12) to get (5x - 12) - (-6x) = 11x - 12. 4. Divide 11x by x to get 11. 5. Multiply 11 times (x - 2) to get 11x - 22. 6. Subtract (11x - 22) from (11x - 12) to get 10. So, we have y = 3x + 11 + frac{10}{x-2}. As x rightarrow infty or x rightarrow -infty, the term frac{10}{x-2} approaches 0, simplifying the expression to the slant asymptote y = 3x + 11.

This line meets the circle at points E and E_1.    - Connect E and M.  3. **Prove Geometric Properties:**    - First, note that (CO = R), where R is the radius of the circle.    - Since D is the foot of the perpendicular from C to OA, triangle COD is a right-angled triangle at D.    - Thus, (CD = OC sin(angle COA)). But in this context, since OC is a radius and OA is the diameter, (angle COA = 90^circ), making CD = frac{R}{2} since we must calculate it with respect to half the circle diameter segment. 4. **Locate Point M:**    - By definition, OM = CD. Given CD = frac{R}{2}, we have:      [      OM = frac{R}{2}      ]    - We now need to determine the geometric place of point M. Since CDO is right-angled at D, we have:      [      angle CDO = 90^circ - angle COA = 90^circ      ]      Thus, (M) being at a distance OM=frac{R}{2} from O lies on the arc defined by the perpendicular inclination from OE over OA. 5. **Geometric Locus Conclusion:**    - Since OM = CD=frac{R}{2}, and angle COA is consistent with this property symmetrically we must consider both sides of the perpendicular from OE erecting the half-radii formations.    - Since we have already established that OE and OE_1 intersect the circle perpendicularly circumferencing OA, it follows from symmetry principles that the point M can lie on either side relative to OE and OE_1's perpendicular upholding. # Conclusion: The geometric locus of point (M) is a circle centered at (O) with radius (frac{R}{2}), and upholding symmetrical congruence for inclinations relative to perpendicular overdrafts via side (CDB) rasterization.

Step 3: Solve for a and b. - From 3 + 2b = a, we express a in terms of b: a = 3 + 2b. - Substituting a = 3 + 2b into 3a + 2 = b, we get 3(3 + 2b) + 2 = b. - Simplifying, we find 9 + 6b + 2 = b. - Further simplification gives 11 + 5b = b. - Rearranging, we get 4b = -11. - Dividing by 4, we find b = -frac{11}{5}. - Substituting b = -frac{11}{5} into a = 3 + 2b, we get a = 3 + 2(-frac{11}{5}). - Simplifying, we find a = 3 - frac{22}{5} = -frac{7}{5}.

Hence, cos alpha = 1 - 2t^2. If there is no point Q on the curve C such that angle F_1QF_2 = theta, then theta > alpha, which implies cos theta < 1 - 2t^2.

Let's refer to this smaller part as a \\"segment.\\" After making such a cut, she continues similarly:    - Number of vertices initially: 1001    - Number of nights for cutting along adjacent points: 1000    After 1000 nights, she will be left with a 1001-gon with one segment cut off. 3. **Remaining 998 Cuts:**    After following the strategy for the first 1000 nights and reducing the vertices systematically, she will now change her approach by cutting off triangular sections:    - From the 1001-gon with a cut-off segment, she will continue by cutting along triangles, ensuring each cut removes one vertex.    - Each such operation will reduce the shape from an (n)-gon to an ((n-1))-gon.    - Remaining vertices after the first 1000 nights: 1001    - Cuts needed to reduce from a (1001-1)-gon to a triangle: 999 cuts 4. **Final Night:**    After 998 more nights:    - Number of vertices left: 3 (as she was removing one vertex with each cut).    - After the 1998th night: she will have a triangle with a segment separated. 5. **Conclusion:**    On the 1999th night, it will be impossible for Sheregade to make a cut that results in a shape that isn't a polygon since she will have only a triangle and a segment outside it, hence not fulfilling Shahrayar's conditions.

Let's assume 3 units of income is Rs. 20,000, then 1 unit would be Rs. 20,000 / 3 = Rs. 6,666.67 (approximately). Since the expenditure is 2 units, it would be 2 * Rs. 6,666.67 = Rs. 13,333.34 (approximately). Therefore, savings from source A = Income - Expenditure = Rs. 20,000 - Rs. 13,333.34 = Rs. 6,666.66 (approximately). For income source B: The ratio of income to expenditure is 4:1. This means for every 4 units of income, there is 1 unit of expenditure. John's income from source B is Rs. 30,000. Let's assume 4 units of income is Rs. 30,000, then 1 unit would be Rs. 30,000 / 4 = Rs. 7,500. Since the expenditure is 1 unit, it would be 1 * Rs. 7,500 = Rs. 7,500. Therefore, savings from source B = Income - Expenditure = Rs. 30,000 - Rs. 7,500 = Rs. 22,500. For income source C: The ratio of income to expenditure is 5:3. This means for every 5 units of income, there are 3 units of expenditure. John's income from source C is Rs. 45,000. Let's assume 5 units of income is Rs. 45,000, then 1 unit would be Rs. 45,000 / 5 = Rs. 9,000. Since the expenditure is 3 units, it would be 3 * Rs. 9,000 = Rs. 27,000. Therefore, savings from source C = Income - Expenditure = Rs. 45,000 - Rs. 27,000 = Rs. 18,000. Now, let's sum up the savings from all sources: Total savings = Savings from A + Savings from B + Savings from C Total savings = Rs. 6,666.66 + Rs. 22,500 + Rs. 18,000 Total savings = Rs. 47,166.66 (approximately). John's total savings from all income sources is approximately Rs. boxed{47,166.66} ."},{"instruction":"Using red, yellow, and blue to color the nine small squares labeled 1, 2, 3, cdots, 9 in the figure, so that any two adjacent (sharing a common edge) small squares are colored differently, and the squares labeled 3, 5, 7 are all the same color, determine the number of possible coloring methods.","output":"Let's solve the problem step-by-step to find the total number of ways to color the given squares according to the given constraints:  1. **Step 1: Coloring squares 3, 5, and 7**    Squares 3, 5, and 7 must be colored the same color.

Moreover, any  10  spies can numbered in such a way that the first spy watches on the second, the second watches on the third and so on until the tenth watches on the first. Prove that any  11  spies can also be numbered is a similar manner.","output":"1. **Graph Representation and Initial Conditions**:    We represent the problem using a directed graph ( D ) with 16 vertices, where each vertex represents a spy. The directed edges represent the \\"watching\\" relationship, such that if there is a directed edge from vertex ( A ) to vertex ( B ) (denoted ( A rightarrow B )), then ( A ) watches ( B ) and ( B ) does not watch ( A ). 2. **Property of Directed Cycles**:    It is given that for any set of 10 vertices ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_{10} ), there exists a permutation ( pi in mathcal{S}_{10} ) such that ( v_{pi(1)} rightarrow v_{pi(2)} rightarrow cdots rightarrow v_{pi(10)} rightarrow v_{pi(1)} ) forms a directed cycle. 3. **Degree Constraints**:    We need to show that for any set of 11 vertices, a similar directed cycle can be formed. First, we establish the degree constraints for any vertex ( v ) in ( D ). Let ( d^+(v) ) and ( d^-(v) ) denote the out-degree and in-degree of ( v ), respectively. We claim that ( 7 leq d^+(v) leq 8 ) and ( 7 leq d^-(v) leq 8 ).    - Suppose ( d^+(v) < 7 ). Then, the set ( {v} cup overline{N^+(v)} ) (where ( overline{N^+(v)} ) is the complement of the out-neighborhood of ( v )) contains at least 10 vertices. This set cannot contain a directed cycle of length 10, contradicting the given property.    - Suppose ( d^+(v) geq 9 ). Then, the set ( {v} cup N^+(v) ) contains at least 10 vertices. This set cannot contain a directed cycle of length 10, again contradicting the given property.    - Similar arguments apply to ( d^-(v) ), leading to the conclusion that ( 7 leq d^-(v) leq 8 ). 4. **Considering 11 Vertices**:    Now, consider any set of 11 vertices ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_{11} ). We need to show that these vertices can be arranged to form a directed cycle. 5. **Existence of a Suitable Vertex**:    Suppose there exists a vertex ( v_1 ) such that all other vertices ( v_2, v_3, ldots, v_{11} ) are either in ( N^+(v_1) ) or ( N^-(v_1) ). Note that both ( N^+(v_1) neq emptyset ) and ( N^-(v_1) neq emptyset ) because ( 7 leq d^+(v_1) leq 8 ) and ( 7 leq d^-(v_1) leq 8 ). 6. **Forming the Directed Cycle**:    By the given property, there exists a directed cycle on ( v_2, v_3, ldots, v_{11} ). In this cycle, there must be vertices ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) such that ( v_i rightarrow v_j ) and ( v_i in N^-(v_1) ), ( v_j in N^+(v_1) ). We can then form a directed cycle on all 11 vertices by taking the detour ( ldots rightarrow v_i rightarrow v_1 rightarrow v_j rightarrow ldots ), where the rest of the cycle follows the original cycle on ( v_2, v_3, ldots, v_{11} ). 7. **Ensuring the Scenario Always Occurs**:    We need to show that the above scenario will always occur for at least one vertex ( v ). Since ( 7 leq d^+(v) leq 8 ) and ( 7 leq d^-(v) leq 8 ), and ( N^+(v) cap N^-(v) = emptyset ), it follows that ( 14 leq d^+(v) + d^-(v) leq 15 ). This means any vertex is not adjacent to at most one vertex in the corresponding undirected graph. Considering the complement of the undirected graph, any 11 vertices must have a matching of size at most 5, implying there must be an isolated vertex. Thus, there exists a vertex ( v ) among the 11 vertices such that all other vertices belong either to ( N^+(v) ) or ( N^-(v) ), and by the above argument, we can form the required directed cycle.

We can box the final result as: boxed{a_n = frac{(a + 2)(2n + 1)}{3} cdot 2^{n-1} - 2.} (2) Using the result from part (1), when a=1, the term a_n is given by a_n=(2n+1) cdot 2^{n-1} - 2. The sum S_n then becomes the sum of the terms up to n, which is S_n = 3 + 5 times 2 + 7 times 2^2 + dots + (2n+1) cdot 2^{n-1} - 2n. Using the method of differences, we can find that T_n = 3 + 5 times 2 + 7 times 2^2 + dots + (2n+1) cdot 2^{n-1} = (2n-1) cdot 2^n + 1. Therefore, the sum S_n can be expressed as: S_n = T_n - 2n = (2n-1) cdot 2^{n-1}. Thus, we can box the final result for the sum as: boxed{S_n = (2n-1) cdot 2^{n-1}.}"},{"instruction":"300 m long train crosses a platform in 27 sec while it crosses a signal pole in 18 sec . what is the length of the platform ?","output":"Let's denote the length of the platform as ( L ).

The path: [A, B, C, ldots, L, M, N, ldots, T] can be shortened compared to: [A, B, C, ldots, L, N, ldots, T] when segment (T M) is considered separately. To ensure the path ( A, B, C, ldots, L, M, N, ldots, T ) is the longest, it is necessary for every two adjacent segments to have opposite directions.

However, since two of the books are identical, we must adjust our calculation to avoid overcounting arrangements that are essentially the same due to the interchangeability of the identical books.

Hence,    [    a_1 geq a_3 + 2a_4 + 3a_5 + ldots    ]    This is because vertices of degree 3 or more require at least one adjacent degree 1 vertex, vertices of degree 4 require at least two, and so on. 5. The total number of endpoints of the d diagonals is 2d. These endpoints lie at the vertices, with each vertex of degree i contributing i endpoints. This gives:    [    2d = a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 + 4a_4 + ldots    ] 6. Using the previous results, we can bound the sum:    [    2d = left(a_1 + 2a_2 + 2a_3 + 2a_4 + ldots right) + left(a_3 + 2a_4 + ldots right)    ]    Using the inequality for a_1, we can rewrite this as:    [    2d leq left(a_1 + 2a_2 + 2a_3 + 2a_4 + ldots right) + a_1    ]    Simplifying further, we get:    [    2d leq 2 left(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ldots right) leq 2n    ]    Thus, we conclude:    [    d leq n    ]    Hence, it is demonstrated that it is not possible to select more than n diagonals such that any two of them intersect. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The coordinates of the vertex of the parabola y=x^2+15 are ______.","output":"Solution: The coordinates of the vertex of the parabola y=-x^2+15 are (0, 15).

We know the author's total earnings are 1104, and we've already calculated the earnings from the paper cover version to be 384. So, the earnings from the hardcover version is: 1104 (total earnings) - 384 (earnings from paper cover) = 720 The author gets 12% of the sales from the hardcover version, so to find the total sales from the hardcover version, we divide the author's earnings from the hardcover version by 12%: 720 / 0.12 = 6,000 Now, we know that each hardcover book is sold at 0.40, so to find the number of hardcover copies sold, we divide the total sales from the hardcover version by the price per hardcover copy: 6,000 / 0.40/copy = 15,000 copies Therefore, boxed{15,000}  copies of the hardcover version were sold."},{"instruction":"A regular triangle with side length 3 has its vertices on the surface of sphere O.

Firstly, we need to find the radius of the circumscribed circle of the regular triangle (which lies on the plane of the triangle). The formula for the radius r of the circumscribed circle of a regular triangle with side length a is: [ r = frac{a}{sqrt{3}} ] So by substituting a=3, we find: [ r = frac{3}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3} ] Given that d = sqrt{7}, the radius R of sphere O can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The radius R is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is r (the radius of the circumscribed circle of the triangle) and the other leg is d (the distance from the sphere center to the plane): [ R = sqrt{r^2 + d^2} = sqrt{left(sqrt{3}right)^2 + left(sqrt{7}right)^2} = sqrt{3 + 7} = sqrt{10} ] Now, we can calculate the surface area S of sphere O using the formula S = 4pi R^2.

This means ( M ) also lies on the angle bisector of ( angle ACK ). 4. **Key Observations:**    - ( angle MAC ) and ( angle MCA ) are equal due to the isosceles triangle ( AMC ).    - The equality of alternate interior angles ( angle CMA ) and ( angle MCK ) implies ( AM ) is parallel to ( NC ). 5. **Angle Calculations:**    - Since ( AM parallel NC ), corresponding angles ( angle MAC ) and ( angle ACN ) are equal and both are ( frac{angle BAC}{2} ).    - Thus, ( angle ANC = angle BAC - angle ACN = angle BAC - frac{angle BAC}{2} = frac{angle BAC}{2} ). 6. **Conclusion:**    - Triangle ( NAC ) is isosceles with ( A N = AC = 1 ).

Furthermore, the line connecting a vertex of the triangle to the circumcenter of the triangle is perpendicular to the opposite side from the vertex.    Let's focus on one triangle, say (ABD):    - (AC) is the altitude (height) from vertex (A) to side (BD) since diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at right angles at (O).    - The line (AA') (where (A') is the circumcenter of (triangle ABD)) is symmetric to the line (AO) relative to the angle bisector at (A).

In the diagram, there are configurations where 33 cells are painted while satisfying the constraints. These configurations show that it is possible to paint 33 cells. 3. To tackle the problem step by step, we first outline a general strategy:     - Avoid painting entire sides as this increases the number of adjacent cells, later limiting the movement.     - Leave the middle cells of the sides unpainted to ensure flexibility in movement. 4. Let us now consider painting 32 cells first. If we can paint 33 cells, then painting 32 cells can be achieved by stopping one step before completing the 33rd cell.     - As depicted in the provided diagrams, we can paint 32 cells following the rule. Specifically, observe the patterns in these diagrams:         a. **Pattern Example 1:**              - Paint cells in a zig-zag manner, ensuring each newly painted cell shares exactly one side with the previous cell and avoids adjacency with other painted cells.         b. **Pattern Example 2:**             - Consider painting the frame alternatively and filling in the central space systematically.     - Both diagrams explicitly show the possible ways of painting 32 cells on a (7 times 7) board. 5. To paint 33 cells, analyze the provided patterns. Here, these configurations demonstrate that painting 33 cells is possible without violating the constraints.     - For example:         - Start from a corner and follow an S-like pattern across the grid ensuring that each new paint cell shares one side with the last.         - Continue this painting sequence while avoiding path blockage and ensuring no two adjacent painted cells meet other painted cells more than once. 6. By verifying with the provided diagrams, multiple configurations show that 33 cells can be painted.

How many times does he use the bathroom during the movie and the intermissions, considering the extra time spent walking to and from the bathroom?","output":"Let's break down the scenario step by step: 1. The total duration of the movie including intermissions is 2.5 hours (150 minutes) plus two 15-minute intermissions, which adds up to 150 + 15 + 15 = 180 minutes. 2. John uses the bathroom every 50 minutes, but we need to account for the additional 5 minutes it takes him to walk to and from the bathroom. So, effectively, he would need a 55-minute interval to use the bathroom and return without missing the movie. 3. The intermissions are 15 minutes each, and John can use the bathroom during these times without missing any part of the film. This means he has two opportunities to use the bathroom without it counting against the 55-minute intervals. Now, let's calculate how many times John uses the bathroom: - The first 55-minute interval would end at 55 minutes into the movie. Since the movie is 180 minutes long, we divide 180 by 55 to see how many times John can use the bathroom during the movie, including the extra walking time. 180 / 55 = approximately 3.27. Since John can't use the bathroom a fraction of a time, we'll only count the whole numbers, which means he can use the bathroom 3 times during the movie based on the 55-minute intervals. - However, we need to consider the intermissions. The first intermission would likely occur around the halfway point of the movie, which is after 75 minutes. If John uses the bathroom during the first intermission, he effectively resets his 55-minute interval. The second intermission would then occur after another 75 minutes of movie time (150 minutes in total), where he can use the bathroom again. So, John uses the bathroom during the two intermissions, and in between, he can use the bathroom 3 times based on the 55-minute intervals.

Given three colors and a 3x3 grid: 1. Start with the top left corner cell; assume it's colored with color 1. 2. The cell directly to the right and beneath must be of different colors and cannot be color 1. If cell right of the starting cell is color 2, then the bottom cell from the starting point must be color 3. 3. This step forces a specific pattern for the adjoining cells - for instance, the top row following the sequence: 1, 2, 3. 4. For the second row, to avoid color clash, we start with the cell beneath the first of the first row. It must be a color that is neither color of its horizontal or vertical neighbors. Following from our example, the pattern for the middle row would thus be: 3, 1, 2. 5. Similarly, the bottom row would be in direct effect of the top row, so it alternates: 2, 3, 1. By this arrangement, if the top left cell starts with any of the three colors, a fixed pattern follows. However, this results in multiple possible patterns due to different starting colors. Given three possible colors for the first cell, the entire grid arrangement can be influenced as rotations of the pattern dictated by the first-color choice.

We need to show there is a region that can contain a circle of radius 1 text{ mm}. 1. **Identify the Constraint on the Centre of the Small Circle**:     - For an 1 text{ mm} radius circle to fit, its center must be at least 1 text{ mm} away from any of the 1996 lines.     - Simultaneously, the center of this small circle must lie within 1 text{ mm} inside the boundary of the original 2000 text{ mm} radius circle. Hence, the center lies within a circle of radius 1999 text{ mm} (since 2000 - 1 = 1999). 2. **Calculate Coverage by Parallel Strips**:     - For each of the 1996 lines, draw a 2 text{ mm} wide strip centered on the line.

The same question for 7 pencils.","output":"To determine whether it is feasible to arrange 6 pencils such that any two of them are touching, we need to delve deeper into the arrangement and geometry of the pencils. Follow these structured steps to comprehensively analyze the problem.  1. Arrangement of Three Pencils: We start by understanding a basic triangular arrangement, which ensures all pencils touch each other when placed properly. Refer to the following figure (Рис. 11): ![Pencils Arrangement](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_3f2bc5f5a1af26514cfag-016.jpg?height=434&width=818&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=120) Here are the steps for arranging three pencils in such a manner: 1.1 Place the first pencil. 1.2 Place the second pencil such that it touches the first one. The touching points must be exact to avoid any gaps or overlaps. 1.3 Place the third pencil to touch both the first and the second pencil, creating an equilateral triangle of pencils.  2. Extending to Six Pencils: Once the base triangular structure with three pencils is understood, we extend this concept to include six pencils. 2.1 Stack another set of three pencils on top of the initial triangular arrangement. The top set of three pencils will be arranged identically to the lower set, but they will be placed such that each pencil in the top set touches the corresponding two pencils in the base set. Each pencil from the top set should be equidistant from each pencil in the bottom set forming an interlinked triangular lattice. 2.2 Ensure the diameters match: The diameter of the circumcircle formed by the touching points of the three lower pencils must be equal to the diameter of the three upper pencils. By this arrangement, any two pencils, whether from the top or bottom layer, will be touching, achieving our objective for six pencils.  3. Adding the Seventh Pencil: The problem extends further into illustrating how to incorporate a seventh pencil into the neatly stacked arrangement: 3.1 In the provided gaps: Identify the equilateral triangular gap which naturally forms between the pencils at the intersections where upper and lower triangular units meet. 3.2 Insert the seventh pencil into this gap. This seventh pencil should align itself such that it touches all the six pencils around it, assuming the diameter of the pencils conforms to the relation with the lengths correctly.  Mathematical Specification for lambda: To confirm the feasibility in general cases, one must ensure that the pencil diameter (d) and the pencil length (l) satisfy a specific ratio (d/l leq lambda). This lambda value ensures physical compatibility, which is achievable for typical pencil dimensions.  Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to assemble six pencils such that every two touch each other. For seven pencils, the ratio (d/l) should meet a certain threshold lambda, which can be explored in practical scenarios but typically holds true for standard pencil dimensions.

However, this description also fits a trapezoid, where only one pair of opposite sides is parallel. A parallelogram requires both pairs of opposite sides to be parallel, not just one. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily describe a parallelogram exclusively. - **Statement B**: The condition of having equal diagonals does not alone guarantee that a quadrilateral is a rectangle. While rectangles do have equal diagonals, the defining property of a rectangle is that all interior angles are right angles. There are other quadrilaterals, like an isosceles trapezoid, that can also have equal diagonals without being rectangles. Thus, this statement is not accurate in defining a rectangle. - **Statement C**: A quadrilateral with perpendicular and equal diagonals that bisect each other indeed describes a square. This is because, in addition to having equal diagonals that bisect each other (a property of rectangles and rhombi), the diagonals are perpendicular, which is a specific property of squares. However, the statement as it stands implies that any quadrilateral with these properties is a square, which is correct, making this statement true but not the one we're looking for according to the initial solution. - **Statement D**: A parallelogram with one diagonal bisecting an interior angle is indeed a rhombus.

Prove that there are infinitely many even positive integers  k  such that, no matter what choices Sarah makes, her number  N  will at some point be divisible by  2018 .","output":"To prove that there are infinitely many even positive integers ( k ) such that, no matter what choices Sarah makes, her number ( N ) will at some point be divisible by ( 2018 ), we will proceed as follows: 1. **Define the structure of ( N ):**    Write ( N ) as a product of primes:    [    N = PQ = (p_1^{e_1} ldots p_m^{e_m})(q_1^{f_1} ldots q_k^{f_k})    ]    where ( p_i ) are primes that are not congruent to ( 1 pmod{1009} ) (not good primes) and ( q_i ) are primes that are congruent to ( 1 pmod{1009} ) (good primes). Here, ( P ) is the product of the set of powers of ( p_i ) and ( Q ) is similarly for powers of ( q_i ). 2. **Action on good primes:**    If Sarah acts on a prime ( q in Q ), then ( q ) is replaced with ( q^{k+1} - 1 ). Since ( q equiv 1 pmod{1009} ), we have:    [    q^{k+1} - 1 equiv 1^{k+1} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{1009}    ]    Therefore, ( q^{k+1} - 1 ) is divisible by ( 1009 ). Since ( k ) is even, ( q^{k+1} - 1 ) is also even, making ( N ) divisible by ( 2018 ). 3. **Action on non-good primes:**    Suppose Sarah acts on a prime ( p in P ). We choose ( k ) to be of the form ( 1009^t - 1 ). Then ( p ) is replaced by ( p^{1009^t} - 1 ). Consider the prime factors ( p' ) dividing ( p^{1009^t} - 1 ):    [    p^{1009^t} - 1 = (p-1)(1 + p + p^2 + ldots + p^{1009^t-1})    ]    We must have ( p' mid p-1 ) or ( p' mid 1 + p + ldots + p^{1009^t-1} ). Since:    [    gcd(p-1, 1 + p + ldots + p^{1009^t-1}) = gcd(p-1, 1009^t) = 1    ]    In the latter case, ( p' mid p^{1009^t} - 1 ) but ( p' nmid p-1 ), suggesting that ( e = text{ord}(p, p') mid 1009^t ) but ( e neq 1 ). Thus, ( 1009 mid e ) and ( e mid p'-1 ), so ( p' equiv 1 pmod{1009} ) (good prime). 4. **Reduction of ( P ):**    When Sarah picks ( p in P ), ( N ) is multiplied by ( (p-1)(1 + p + ldots + p^{k}) ) and divided by ( p ). The term ( 1 + p + ldots + p^{k} ) contributes factors to ( Q ). Upon division by ( p ), ( P ) loses a factor of ( p ) but gains at most a factor of ( p-1 ), thus decreasing ( P ). 5. **Conclusion:**    We continue this process until ( P ) decreases to ( 1 ), leaving only good primes dividing ( N ). At this point, ( N ) will be divisible by ( 2018 ). Thus, all ( k = 1009^t - 1 ) work, and since there are infinitely many such ( t ), there are infinitely many even positive integers ( k ) that satisfy the condition.

We also know that the inscribed circle passes through the centroid. Calculate the other angles.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the angles of a triangle given that one of its angles is (120^circ) and its incenter passes through the centroid. We'll proceed with a method leveraging trigonometric identities and geometric properties. Let's denote the triangle as (ABC) with the following properties: - (angle A = 120^circ) - The incenter passes through the centroid. 1. **Identify and Label Points**:        Denote the sides opposite to angles (A, B,) and (C) as (a, b,) and (c), respectively. 2. **Geometric Properties**:        The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of all three angles meet. Since it is given that the incenter passes through the centroid (S), we must use some known relationships.     We also know that in any triangle, the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. 3. **Use Trigonometric Identities**:    Using the law of sines in triangle (ABC), for angle (gamma = 120^circ):     [     sin 120^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}     ]     Additionally, we know (alpha + beta = 60^circ). Let’s start translating this geometrical situation into algebraic terms by considering properties and relationships of these angles.      4. **Derive Relationships**:        Using (alpha) and (beta) and the given angle, we set up the following relationships from the law of sines and their sums:        [    5(sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + (sin 120^circ)^2) = 6(sin alpha sin beta + sin alpha sin 120^circ + sin beta sin 120^circ)    ]    Substituting (sin 120^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), we get:    [    5(sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2) = 6(sin alpha sin beta + sin alpha frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + sin beta frac{sqrt{3}}{2})    ]    Simplifying further, we obtain:    [    5(sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + frac{3}{4}) = 6(sin alpha sin beta + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(sin alpha + sin beta))    ] 5. **Simplify the Equation**:    Let (x = sin alpha + sin beta) and (y = sin alpha sin beta). Squaring the sum:    [    x^2 = (sin alpha + sin beta)^2 = sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + 2sin alpha sin beta    ]    Thus,     [    5left( x^2 - 2y + frac{3}{4}right) = 6left( y + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x right)    ] 6. **Setting Up the Final Equation**:    Through appropriate simplifications and considering trigonometric identities, we get:    [    5x^2 - 16y + frac{15}{4} - 3sqrt{3}x = 0    ]    Introducing (x = cos (frac{alpha - beta}{2})), we solve the simplified quadratic equation:    [    11x^2 + 3sqrt{3}x - frac{63}{4} = 0    ] 7. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:    Solving using the quadratic formula (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), where (a = 11), (b = 3sqrt{3}), and (c = -63/4):    [    x = frac{-3sqrt{3} pm sqrt{(3sqrt{3})^2 - 4 cdot 11 cdot left(-frac{63}{4}right)}}{2 cdot 11}    ]    This resolves to two solutions, where one is negative and the other positive and applicable. Hence, substituting and solving for angles: 8. **Final Computation**:    After careful computation, only the positive solution is taken forward:    [    cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) = frac{12sqrt{5} - 3sqrt{3}}{22}    ]    Hence:    [    alpha = 19^circ 34' quad text{and} quad beta = 40^circ 26'    ] # Conclusion Thus, the angles of the triangle are: [ boxed{120^circ, 19^circ 34', 40^circ 26'} ]"},{"instruction":"a quadrilateral ABCD, angle DBC is 130^circ and angle BCD is 30^circ.

This is because if x were negative or zero, the product lceil x rceil cdot x would be nonpositive (either negative or zero), which cannot equal 135. Therefore, x > 0. 2. **Range of lceil x rceil**: Knowing the property of the ceiling function, lceil x rceil - 1 < x leq lceil x rceil, we need to find a value for lceil x rceil such that lceil x rceil cdot x = 135.

Let's reconsider the given equation:    [    x^{2} + y^{2} - 2y + 2 = 0.    ] 2. We can rearrange and simplify the given equation by completing the square. Combine the terms involving (y):    [    x^{2} + (y^{2} - 2y) + 2 = 0.    ] 3. To complete the square for the terms involving (y), add and subtract (1) (since (left(frac{-2}{2}right)^2 = 1)):    [    x^{2} + (y^{2} - 2y + 1 - 1) + 2 = 0,    ]    which simplifies to    [    x^{2} + (y - 1)^{2} - 1 + 2 = 0.    ] 4. Further simplification gives us:    [    x^{2} + (y - 1)^{2} + 1 = 0.    ] 5.

Consequently, the left-hand side of the equation (x^{2} + (y - 1)^{2} + 1) is always at least (1) because the expression (x^{2} + (y - 1)^{2}) is non-negative:    [    x^{2} + (y - 1)^{2} + 1 geq 1.    ] 8.

To prove the problem statement, we only need to show that points ( D ) and ( E ) are the midpoints of segments ( PS ) and ( QS ) respectively. For this purpose, we first need to show that quadrilateral ( RPTS ) is a parallelogram. 4. From the given condition ( overparen{CD} = overparen{DE} = overparen{EF} ), it follows that ( angle TBS = angle TAS ) and ( angle RAP = angle RBP ). Therefore, ( A, B, S, T ) lie on a common circle, and ( A, B, R, P ) lie on another common circle. Consequently, ( angle RTS = angle PBA = angle PRA ), which implies ( PR parallel TS ), providing the first parallel condition for the quadrilateral (idea 1). 5. Further, we can prove that points ( S ) and ( T ) are the midpoints of triangles ( triangle ARB ) and ( triangle APB ) respectively. From this, we have ( PT parallel RS ) as both ( PT ) and ( RS ) are the midpoints lines in these triangles (idea 2). Hence, quadrilateral ( RSTP ) is a parallelogram. 6. Since ( RSTP ) is a parallelogram, it follows that ( D ) is the midpoint of ( PS ), and similarly, ( E ) being the midpoint of ( QS ) can be proved using analogous reasoning. 7.

We need to show that the points of intersection of the medians of the resulting triangles, formed by connecting every other midpoint of the sides, coincide. 1. **Identifying Midpoints**:    Let (M_1, M_2, ldots, M_6) be the midpoints of the sides (A_1A_2, A_2A_3, ldots, A_6A_1). 2. **Forming Triangles**:    To obtain the triangles, we connect midpoints of non-adjacent sides:    [    text{Form triangles: } triangle M_1 M_3 M_5 text{ and } triangle M_2 M_4 M_6.    ] 3. **Properties of Medians in Triangles**:    The centroid (G) of a triangle formed from the midpoints of a hexagon (the center of mass) will serve as the point of intersection of the medians of each triangle. 4. **Centroid Calculation**:    Consider triangle ( triangle M_1 M_3 M_5 ). The centroid can be defined as the average of the positions of (M_1, M_3, M_5). This is similarly done for triangle ( triangle M_2 M_4 M_6 ).        Since these midpoints themselves were determined by the averages of the pairs of hexagon vertices, the triangles' centroids must coincide at the centroid of the hexagon.

Consider the sums:    [    S_{1} = a_{1}, quad S_{2} = a_{1} + a_{2}, quad ldots, quad S_{100} = a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{100}.    ] 2. **Modulus and Remainders**:    If none of these sums is divisible by 100, then the sums (S_{1}, S_{2}, ldots, S_{100}) give at most 99 different remainders when divided by 100. 3. **Applying Pigeonhole Principle**:    According to the Pigeonhole Principle, because there are 100 sums and only 99 possible remainders (from 0 to 99), there must exist at least two sums, (S_{n}) and (S_{m}) ((n > m)), that have the same remainder modulo 100. 4. **Subtracting Sums**:    Let (S_{n} equiv S_{m} , (text{mod } 100)). This implies:    [    S_{n} - S_{m} = k cdot 100 quad text{for some integer } k.    ]    Hence, the difference (S_{n} - S_{m}) is divisible by 100. 5. **Isolating Part of the Series**:    The difference between these sums represents the sum of a subset of the original numbers:    [    S_{n} - S_{m} = a_{m+1} + a_{m+2} + cdots + a_{n}.    ]    Thus, this subset sums to a number divisible by 100. 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, there always exists a subset of the given 100 numbers whose sum is divisible by 100: [ blacksquare ]"},{"instruction":"f |a1|+(b+2)^2=0, then the value of ab is (　　) A: 1 B: 1 C: 3 D: 3","output":"From the given condition, we have a-1=0 and b+2=0.

And calculate the maximum profit.","output":"(1) Let's denote the selling price as x CNY per item. By the problem's description, we can determine the monthly sales volume and then calculate the monthly profit from sales. First, let's define the relationship between the selling price and the sales volume. Starting from 4 CNY per item, for every 0.5 CNY decrease in price, 40 more items are sold. The opposite applies for an increase in price. We can express this relationship as:  text{Selling Volume} = 400 + frac{4 - x}{0.5} times 40,  since x is the selling price per item. Next, we need to consider that the cost price is 3 CNY per item. So the profit for each item sold is x - 3. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:  y = (x - 3) times (text{Selling Volume}).  Substituting the expression for the selling volume into the profit equation, we get:  y = (x - 3) times left(400 + frac{4 - x}{0.5} times 40right).  After expanding and simplifying, we get:  y = (x - 3) times (400 + 80 times (8 - 2x))   y = (x - 3) times (400 + 640 - 160x)   y = (x - 3) times (-160x + 1040)   y = -160x^2 + 1040x - 480x + 3120   y = -160x^2 + 560x + 3120.  So the analytic expression for the function that relates the selling price x to the profit y is:  y = -160x^2 + 560x + 3120.  (2) To find the maximum profit, we analyze the quadratic function y(x). The quadratic function y = ax^2 + bx + c reaches its maximum value when x = -frac{b}{2a}. Applying this to our function, we have:  x = -frac{560}{2 times (-160)}   x = -frac{560}{-320}   x = 1.75.  However, since we adjust the price by multiples of 0.5, we cannot set the price at 1.75 CNY. We need to choose between 1.5 CNY or 2 CNY, which are the closest viable retail prices. Let's calculate the profit for both: For x = 1.5 CNY:  y = -160(1.5)^2 + 560(1.5) + 3120   y = -160(2.25) + 840 + 3120   y = -360 + 840 + 3120   y = 3600.  For x = 2 CNY:  y = -160(2)^2 + 560(2) + 3120   y = -160(4) + 1120 + 3120   y = -640 + 1120 + 3120   y = 3600.  Interestingly, both prices yield the same profit.

By the inductive hypothesis, we can remove ( n - m ) columns from the first ( m ) rows and still have unique rows. The remaining ( m + 1 )th row must also be unique among the remaining rows, as it was initially unique. 5. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the largest integer ( k ) such that for any initial coloring, we can always color ( k ) columns entirely red and still have unique rows is ( n - m + 1 ). The final answer is ( boxed{n - m + 1} )."},{"instruction":"A set ( H ) contains ( n ) elements: ( |H| = n ). Show that [  sum_{A subseteq H} sum_{B subseteq H}|A cap B| = n cdot 4^{n1} ]","output":"1. Let's consider a set ( H ) with ( |H| = n ). 2. We need to show the following equation:    [    sum_{A subseteq H} sum_{B subseteq H} |A cap B| = n cdot 4^{n-1}    ]  First Solution: 3. For any subset ( R subseteq H ), let ( bar{R} ) denote its complement in ( H ), i.e., the set of elements in ( H ) that are not in ( R ). 4. Construct ordered pairs ( (A, B) ) from subsets of ( H ). Since ( H ) has ( 2^n ) subsets, the number of such ordered pairs is ( 2^n cdot 2^n = 4^n ). 5. Group these ordered pairs into quadruples: each group contains the pairs ( (A, B), (bar{A}, B), (A, bar{B}), (bar{A}, bar{B}) ) for all ( A, B subseteq H ). 6. It is straightforward to see that every ordered pair belongs to exactly one such group, so the number of these groups is ( frac{1}{4} cdot 4^n = 4^{n-1} ). 7. Consider an element ( h in H ) and subsets ( A, B subseteq H ). Since ( h ) belongs to exactly one of ( A ) or ( bar{A} ) (and similarly for ( B ) and ( bar{B} )), ( h ) will be in exactly one of the sets ( A cap B, bar{A} cap B, A cap bar{B}, bar{A} cap bar{B} ). 8. Hence, for every pair ( (A, B) ), the sum of the sizes of these intersections is ( |H| = n ). 9. Summing over all ( 4^{n-1} ) groups, the total sum of sizes of the intersections ( |A cap B| ) is ( n cdot 4^{n-1} ).  Second Solution: 10. Let us use the notations from the first solution. Order the elements of ( H ), and for each pair of subsets ( A, B subseteq H ), assign an ( n )-digit number in base 4 (quaternary system) based on the membership of the ( i )-th element of ( H ) in the sets ( A cap B, bar{A} cap B, A cap bar{B}, bar{A} cap bar{B} ). 11. In this way, we generate ( 4^n ) distinct numbers, representing all possible combinations. 12. In these numbers, the total number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2, or 3) is equal. Specifically, there are ( frac{1}{4} cdot 4^n cdot n = 4^{n-1} cdot n ) zeros,  corresponding to ( |A cap B| ) values summed over all pairs. 13. Therefore, the total number of zeros is precisely the sum ( sum_{A subseteq H} sum_{B subseteq H} |A cap B| ).  Third Solution: 14. For each element ( x in H ), determine the number of pairs ( (A, B) ) such that ( x in A cap B ). 15. If ( x in A ), each of the remaining ( n - 1 ) elements can either be in ( A ) or not, giving ( 2^{n-1} ) choices for ( A ). Similarly, there are ( 2^{n-1} ) choices for ( B ). 16. Hence, there are ( 2^{n-1} cdot 2^{n-1} = 4^{n-1} ) such pairs for each ( x in H ). 17. Summing over all ( n ) elements of ( H ), the total is ( n cdot 4^{n-1} ). # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that (sum_{A subseteq H} sum_{B subseteq H} |A cap B| = n cdot 4^{n-1} ).

Can it end up at the starting point after the 25th jump?","output":"To determine if the grasshopper can return to its starting point after 25 jumps, we need to analyze the pattern of its jumps and consider the sum of the distances it moves in each direction. 1. **List the Distances for Each Jump:**    The grasshopper's jumps increase progressively by 2 cm each time and can be either positive or negative, depending on the chosen direction (+1, -1):    - 1st jump: ( pm 1 ) cm    - 2nd jump: ( pm 3 ) cm    - 3rd jump: ( pm 5 ) cm    - ( ldots )    - 25th jump: ( pm 49 ) cm 2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**    The possible total distance from the starting point after 25 jumps is the sum of the series: ( 1 + 3 + 5 + ldots + 49 ).    To find the sum of this arithmetic series:    [    S_{25} = sum_{k=0}^{24} (2k+1)    ]    Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) odd numbers,    [    S_n = n^2    ]    where ( n = 25 ),    [    S_{25} = 25^2 = 625     ]    This means the total is 625 cm, considering all jumps in the same direction. 3. **Considering Direction Changes:**    Each jump can be either positive or negative, so the total displacement could be summed as:    [    sum_{i=1}^{25} pm (2i-1)    ]    To return to the starting point after 25 jumps, the total displacement must equal 0.  4. **Condition for Returning to the Start:**    The key point is that the sum ( S_{25} ) must reach 0. Since each ( pm (2i-1) ) is an odd number, the sum of an odd number of odd terms (25 in our case) results in an odd number. 5. **Conclusion:**    Because an odd sum over an odd number of terms never equals zero,    [    boxed{text{No, the grasshopper cannot return to the starting point after 25 jumps.}}    ] After 25 jumps, the grasshopper will always be displaced by an odd number of centimeters from the starting point, making it impossible to be back at the original position."},{"instruction":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, then a_1 < a_3 is the ______ condition for a_n < a_{n+1}.","output":"For an arithmetic sequence, from a_1 < a_3, we get a_1 < a_1 + 2d, which implies d > 0.

Jerry's one-way trip time is 15 minutes, so his round trip time is 15 minutes to the school plus 15 minutes back, for a total of 30 minutes. Since Carson takes 30 minutes for a one-way trip to the school, which is 4 miles away, we can calculate his speed in miles per hour. First, we convert 30 minutes to hours: 30 minutes = 30/60 hours = 0.5 hours Now we can calculate Carson's speed: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 4 miles / 0.5 hours Speed = 8 miles per hour So, Carson runs at a speed of boxed{8}  miles per hour."},{"instruction":"Ronald does laundry every 6 days and Tim does laundry every few days. They both did their laundry today. It will be 18 days until Ronald and Tim both do laundry on the same day again.

We know that Ronald does his laundry every 6 days, and they both did their laundry today. They will both do laundry again on the same day in 18 days. Since they both do laundry on the same day in 18 days, the number of days after which Tim does his laundry (T) must be a factor of 18. Additionally, since they both did laundry today, T must also be a factor of 18 that, when multiplied by some integer, gives us 18. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. We can eliminate 1 and 18 because doing laundry every 1 day or every 18 days would not match the given information. We can also eliminate 6 because that's when Ronald does his laundry, and we're looking for the frequency with which Tim does his. That leaves us with the factors 2, 3, and 9. Since 18 days is the first time they do laundry on the same day again, we are looking for the greatest common factor of 6 (Ronald's laundry cycle) and Tim's laundry cycle that is less than 18. The greatest common factor of 6 and 18 is 6, but since Tim's cycle is different from Ronald's, we can eliminate 6. The next greatest factor of 18 that is less than 6 is 3. If Tim did his laundry every 3 days, then in 18 days, he would have done laundry 6 times (because 18 divided by 3 is 6), which aligns with Ronald doing his laundry every 6 days (because 18 divided by 6 is 3).

We are interested in finding the total sum of sums for all non-empty subsets of M, where each element k in a subset A is multiplied by left(-1right)^{k} before summing. First, let's consider how many times each number appears in these sums across all subsets: 1. For the number 1, it can appear in subsets of various sizes, from a single-element subset to a ten-element subset that includes all elements of M.  - Single-element subsets containing 1 only have {1}, so 1 appears {C}_{9}^{0}=1 time. - Two-element subsets containing 1 can be formed by pairing 1 with any of the other 9 elements, so 1 appears {C}_{9}^{1}=9 times. - Three-element subsets containing 1 can be formed by choosing any 2 from the remaining 9 elements to join 1, so 1 appears {C}_{9}^{2} times. - ... - Ten-element subset, which is the entire set M, includes 1 exactly once, so here 1 appears {C}_{9}^{9}=1 time. Summing these up, the total number of times 1 appears in all subsets is given by the sum of combinations {C}_{9}^{0}+{C}_{9}^{1}+{C}_{9}^{2}+cdots+{C}_{9}^{9}. This sum equals 2^{9} due to the binomial theorem, which tells us that the sum of combinations from {C}_{n}^{0} to {C}_{n}^{n} equals 2^{n}. 2. Applying the same logic to each number from 1 to 10, we find that each number appears 2^{9} times across all subsets. 3. To find the total sum of these sums for all non-empty subsets, we multiply each number by its respective left(-1right)^{k} factor and then by the number of times it appears across all subsets.

The area ( S_{triangle ARE} ) of the triangle ( ARE ) is given by:    [    S_{triangle ARE} = frac{1}{2} cdot AE cdot h_{1}    ] 5. Next, we relate the heights ( h ) and ( h_{1} ). Observe that the ratio of the heights of the parallelogram to the triangle is the inverse of the ratio of the bases, since the areas divided by their respective bases must yield the same height. Hence,    [    frac{h}{h_{1}} = frac{AB}{AR} = frac{AB}{frac{2}{3}AB} = frac{3}{2}    ] 6. Substitute the value of ( h_{1} ) in terms of ( h ):    [    h_{1} = frac{2}{3}h    ] 7. Now we express the area of triangle ( ARE ) in terms of the dimensions and heights of the parallelogram:    [    S_{triangle ARE} = frac{1}{2} cdot AE cdot h_{1} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{3}AD cdot frac{2}{3}h = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{3} cdot frac{2}{3} cdot AD cdot h = frac{1}{9} AD cdot h    ] 8. Hence, the ratio of the area of the parallelogram ( ABCD ) to the area of the triangle ( ARE ) can now be calculated:    [    frac{S_{ABCD}}{S_{triangle ARE}} = frac{AD cdot h}{frac{1}{9} AD cdot h} = frac{AD cdot h}{AD cdot h} cdot 9 = 9    ] 9.

The circumcircle of triangle AEF meets Omega again at P, and lines PN and BC intersect at Q. Prove that lines IQ and DN intersect on Omega.  1. **Establish Cyclic Quadrilaterals:**    Since AEF and APBC are cyclic, we have angle APB = angle ACB. 2. **Angles in Cyclic Quadrilateral APEF:**    Because EF is the perpendicular from I to AI, angle EAF + angle EF = 90^circ. 3. **Determine Key Angles:**    Calculate the angles in triangle APF and triangle APC:        angle CPF = angle BPA - angle BPC - angle FPA = (180^circ - angle BCA) - angle BAC - angle FEA        Simplify using:        angle CPF = (180^circ - angle BCA - angle BAC) - angle BED        This results in:        angle CPF = angle CBA - angle BED = angle CBE - angle BED = angle BDE = angle CDF        Therefore, DPFC is cyclic. 4. **Establish Cyclicity of DPFC:**        angle CPD = angle CFD = 180^circ - angle IFA = 90^circ + angle IAF = 90^circ + angle CAN = 90^circ + angle CPN        Hence:        angle DPN = angle CPD - angle CPN = 90^circ     5. **Proof of Cyclicity for DPIN:**    Using angle DIN = 90^circ by construction, DPIN is cyclic with circumcircle Gamma. 6. **Intersection and Ratio Calculation:**    Let J be the second intersection of line IQ and Gamma. We note:        frac{|JQ|}{|JP|} = frac{|NQ|}{|NI|} = frac{|NQ|}{|NB|} = frac{|CQ|}{|CP|}     7. **Establish Similarity and Ratio in CQN and PCN:**    Consider S, the intersection of PN with Omega such that P, N, S are collinear:        frac{|CQ|}{|CP|} = frac{|NC|}{|NP|} = frac{|NQ|}{|NC|}     8. **Concluding Apollonius Circle:**    Comparing the ratios, we find that C, J, S lie on a circle of Apollonius centered at N. Thus, J lies on Omega. 9. **Perpendiculars and Concurrence:**    Since angle DIN = angle DJN = 90^circ, triangles DIN and DJN are congruent, making DINJ a kite. Therefore, IJ perp DN and Q lies on IJ by definition. 10. **Final Conclusion:**    Therefore, lines IQ and DN must intersect on Omega. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The ratio of the father's age to his son's age is unknown.

The sequence is 1 - 4 + 7 - 10 + cdots + 49 - 52 + 55. When we pair the terms, for example, (1, -4), (7, -10), ldots, (49, -52), we notice that each pair sums up to -3. This is because each pair consists of a positive number followed by a number that is 3 less than the next number in the sequence, which results in n - (n+3) = -3. Given that the sequence ends with 55, which does not have a pair, we need to calculate the number of pairs before adding the last number. The sequence starts at 1 and ends at 49 for the pairing purpose, and the difference between each term is 3. To find the number of terms that can be paired, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_n is the last term that can be paired (49), a_1 is the first term (1), and d is the common difference (3). However, since we are dealing with pairs and the sequence alternates between addition and subtraction, we adjust our approach to count the pairs directly. There are (49 + 5)/6 = 9 pairs. This calculation accounts for the sequence's structure by effectively grouping the terms into pairs and considering the alternating signs. The sum of all pairs is then -3 cdot 9 = -27, since each pair sums to -3 and there are 9 such pairs.

To find the percentage reduction, we can use the following formula: Percentage Reduction = [(Original Amount - Reduced Amount) / Original Amount] * 100 Plugging in the values we have: Percentage Reduction = [(1800 - 1080) / 1800] * 100 Percentage Reduction = [720 / 1800] * 100 Percentage Reduction = 0.4 * 100 Percentage Reduction = 40% So, the percentage reduction is boxed{40%} ."},{"instruction":"Given a horizontal strip in the plane bounded by two parallel lines, and ( n ) lines intersecting this strip, where each pair of these lines intersects within the strip, and no three of them meet at a single point.

We will denote the paths emerging from the points A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n} by numbers 1, 2, ldots, n. From the given construction rules for the paths, the following properties emerge: 1.

Here, let (a = 50), (b = 120), and (c = 130):    [    50^2 + 120^2 = 2500 + 14400 = 16900    ]    [    130^2 = 16900    ]    Since (50^2 + 120^2 = 130^2), this confirms that the triangle is a right triangle. 2. For a right triangle, the area (A) can be calculated using:    [    A = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}    ]    In our triangle, the base and height are the two shorter sides, (50) and (120):    [    A = frac{1}{2} times 50 times 120 = frac{1}{2} times 6000 = 3000    ] 3. Next, we find the semiperimeter (s) of the triangle. The semiperimeter is half of the triangle’s perimeter:    [    s = frac{1}{2} times (50 + 120 + 130) = frac{1}{2} times 300 = 150    ] 4. The inradius (r) of a triangle can be found using the formula:    [    r = frac{A}{s}    ]    Substitute (A = 3000) and (s = 150):    [    r = frac{3000}{150} = 20    ] Conclusion: The radius of the circle inscribed in the triangle is ( boxed{20} )."},{"instruction":"f lceil{sqrt{x}}rceil=10, how many possible integer values of x are there?","output":"The expression lceil{sqrt{x}}rceil = 10 represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt{x}.

Comparing the two expressions for the sum (1294), we have: (k1 + k2 + k3) * D + 17 = k4 * D + 9 This implies that: (k1 + k2 + k3) * D - k4 * D = 9 - 17 (k1 + k2 + k3 - k4) * D = -8 Since D is a divisor and must be a positive integer, and the left side of the equation is a multiple of D, the right side must also be a multiple of D. The smallest positive value of D that satisfies this equation is 8, because -8 is a multiple of 8. Therefore, the value of the divisor D is boxed{8} ."},{"instruction":"an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, if a_{2}+a_{4}=2 and a_{5}=3, then a_{9}=left(  right) A: 3 B: 5 C: 7 D: 9","output":"Given the arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, we have two conditions: a_{2}+a_{4}=2 and a_{5}=3.

The (n)-th term of this sequence can be written as: [ a_{n} = a + (n-1)d ] The sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence, denoted by ( S_{n} ), is given by the formula: [ S_{n} = frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) ] Given that the sum ( S_{n} ) is a perfect square for every ( n ), we need to consider this condition.  1. For ( n = 1 ):    [    S_{1} = a = b^2    ]    where ( b ) is a positive integer. 2. For ( n = 4 ):    [    S_{4} = frac{4}{2} (2a + 3d) = 2(2a + 3d)    ]    Since ( S_{4} ) is a perfect square, ( 2(2a + 3d) ) must be a perfect square as well. For this to be true, the term ( 2a + 3d ) must be an even integer ( k^2 ).    Examining the factorization, we find that ( d ) must be an even integer because ( 2a ) is already an integer. Let ( d = 2e ) where ( e ) is an integer. For any prime number ( p ): 3.

Summary: - The first term ( a ) of the sequence is a perfect square: ( a = b^2 ). - The common difference is ( d = 2a ). Therefore, the arithmetic sequences that satisfy the condition are those where the first term ( a ) is a perfect square and the common difference ( d ) is twice the first term.

This axis ( l ) is one of the symmetry axes of the body. We aim to show that the remaining axes of symmetry form pairs. 2. **Symmetry with Respect to ( l ):**    Consider an axis of symmetry ( l' ). Reflect ( l' ) through ( l ). By definition, reflection over ( l ) will map ( l' ) to some other axis of symmetry, say (l''). 3. **Cases of Intersection:**    Let's analyze the cases of interaction between ( l ) and ( l' ):    - **Case A: ( l' ) does not intersect ( l ):**      If ( l' ) does not intersect ( l ), reflecting ( l' ) through ( l ) will yield a different axis of symmetry, let’s call it ( l'' ).

Reflecting ( l' ) with respect to ( l ) will give us another axis ( l'' ), which is symmetric to ( l' ) relative to ( l ).

This aligns with results from problem 7.39, ensuring that such perpendicular axes result in another perpendicular axis symmetrical to the original intersecting axes at the acute angle.  4. **Conclusion:**    Each ( l' ) has a unique pair, whether the ( l' ) intersects (l) or not. Consequently, any additional axes of symmetry form pairs, always leading to an odd count overall after pairing off ( l ). Hence, the total number of symmetry axes cannot be even.

The collector has a balance scale that can be used to compare the weights of two equalsized groups of coins. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to be sure of finding at least one genuine coin?","output":"To determine the minimum number of weighings needed to guarantee finding at least one genuine coin, we analyze the process step by step: 1. We know there are 30 genuine coins and 70 fake coins. The genuine coins are identical in weight, while each fake coin has a unique weight and all fake coins are heavier than the genuine ones. 2. A single weighing on a balance scale can compare two groups of coins. If two sides balance, both sets are genuine coins. If they do not balance, the heavier side contains at least one fake coin. Given this setup, each weighing can result in one of two pieces of information:    - Identification of two real coins when both sides balance.    - Identification of one fake coin when the sides do not balance. 3. We need to ensure that even in the worst case scenario, we can identify at least one genuine coin. To minimize redundancy and ensure accuracy, we must consider the worst possible outcomes. 4. We need to consider that in a single weighing, if the balance tips, we identify a fake coin. Thus, if we have 70 fake coins, it means we need at least 70 weighings to identify all fake coins or to ensure we have compared enough coins to confidently identify genuine ones. 5. Let's explore why 69 weighings are not enough:     - After 69 weighings where each test did not balance (each time identifying one fake coin), we still wouldn't be sure if we have found all the fake coins or not.     - The worst-case scenario with 69 weighings would leave at least one combination unchecked, leading to uncertain results. 6. On the 70th weighing, if it balances, all compared coins are genuine, confirming the identification of at least one genuine coin. 7. Therefore, after 70 weighings, one of the following two scenarios will be true:    - All 70 fake coins have been found.    - You've conducted enough tests where the balance either confirmed genuine coins or exhausted all other possibilities. Thus, to ensure finding at least one genuine coin in the worst-case scenario, the minimum number of weighings required is **70**.

For our equation, a = 1 and b = -2, so: [ x = -frac{-2}{2 times 1} = 1 ] This means the symmetry axis of the parabola is at x = 1.

The aim is to prevent the formation of a single connected component that spans the entire grid.  Step-by-Step Strategy for Player 2: 1. **Initial Moves:**     - Player 2 specifically targets the edges of the 100 times 100 grid. For each initial move, player 2 will glue together adjacent cells along the boundary of the grid, ensuring these boundary cells become connected with their neighbors.     - This process will take at most 8.99 moves. Note that 8.99 moves is a computed estimate (though a bit informal), suggesting that Player 2 can cover most boundary-adjacent cells within a few turns.      - After these 8.99 moves, 16 cdot 99 pairs of sides will be glued (focusing on boundary pairs). 2. **Glue Pairs Calculation:**     - Total glued pairs from the edge operation: 2 cdot 16 cdot 99 < 5000 dominoes will be glued with something else (meaning Player 2 only needs to ensure that no new large connected component spans the entire grid). 2. **Game Progression:**     - After consolidating the edge pairs, Player 2 will continue making moves while ensuring that each individual move does not lead to a single connected component that can be lifted as described in the problem. 3. **Ensuring Game Continuation:**     - Player 2 can monitor and anticipate any configurations that might lead to a single large connected component and avoid creating or connecting these during their moves. 4. **Even-Odd Argument (Edge Counting):**     - Between any two moves, it’s essential to note that isolated components (each domino piece or glued pair) maintain an even number of \\"cut\\" boundaries (this stems from graph-theoretical properties and Euler’s circuit arguments related to vertex degrees). 5. **Inherent Contradiction and Proof Completeness:**     - Suppose at a certain point, Player 2 fails in ensuring a non-connected layout. All dominoes will then form two connected figures. The boundaries between these components will contain even numbers of pairs due to the grid’s parity logic (initially counted boundary pairs remain even from our glue process).          - The total initial cut boundaries' number (calculated as totaling up boundaries of every domino minus the grid’s perimeter) divided by 2 results in an even number: (6 cdot 5000 - 400) / 2 being even.     - If this remains true, the first player will repeatedly be forced to initiate a game-ending move, leading to the ultimate conclusion; first player’s every move contributing towards the inevitable linkage that results in a single body spanning the grid fails.  Conclusion:     - With the use of boundary strategy and even-odd parity logic governing the moves, Player 2 has a deterministic way to never lose the game by forcing the first player into a position where they cannot produce a winning connecting move without violating the grid's connectedness property first.

The problem gives us two main properties to use:     1. (theta(p + 1) = theta(p) + 1) for any polynomial (p in mathbb{Z}[x]),     2. If (theta(p) neq 0), then (theta(p)) divides (theta(p cdot q)) for any polynomials (p, q in mathbb{Z}[x]). 2. **Notation and Initial Analysis**:     - Let (x in mathbb{Z}[x]) denote the identity polynomial (x(x) = x).     - Define (c = theta(x)). 3. **Working with a Specific Polynomial and Integer (n)**:     - For an integer (n neq c), consider the polynomial (p(x) - p(n)). Note that (x - n) divides (p(x) - p(n)), hence ((x - n) | (p(x) - p(n))).     - Applying (theta) on both sides, we get:     [     theta(x - n) mid theta(p(x) - p(n)) implies c - n mid theta(p(x)) - p(n).     ] 4. **Bounding the Divisibility**:     - Since (c - n) divides (p(c) - p(n)) naturally and by the previous step, combining these, we have:     [     c - n mid theta(p(x)) - p(c).     ]     - By selecting (n) to be arbitrarily large, it follows that (theta(p(x)) = p(c)). Therefore, (theta(p) = p(c)) for all polynomials (p in mathbb{Z}[x]). 5. **Alternate Approach with Degree Consideration**:     - Consider (deg(p) = 0) (constant polynomials). Let (m) be an integer, then (theta(m) = m + theta(0)).     - Given the second property, for constant polynomial (m) and another integer (n):     [     theta(m) mid theta(2m) = 2m + theta(0) implies m + theta(0) mid 2m + theta(0).     ]     - This implies (m + theta(0) mid m), thus by selecting large (m), it follows that (theta(0) = 0) and (theta(m) = m). 6. **Finding (theta) for Linear Polynomials**:     - For degree one polynomial (ax + b):     [     theta(x + b) = theta(x) + b = c + b.     ] 7. **Extending to Higher Degree**:     - Now considering a polynomial of higher degree (p), we use induction.

Since speed is distance over time, we can rearrange this to find distance as speed times time. Train A's speed is 50 mph. To find the distance it travels in 30 minutes, we need to convert 30 minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours. Distance = Speed × Time Distance A = 50 mph × 0.5 hours = 25 miles So, Train A is 25 miles ahead when Train B starts. Now, let's find the relative speed at which Train B is catching up to Train A. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we subtract the speed of Train A from the speed of Train B. Relative speed = Speed B - Speed A Relative speed = 80 mph - 50 mph = 30 mph Now we need to find the time it takes for Train B to cover the 25 miles gap at a relative speed of 30 mph.

The two given points are ( A ) and ( B ). We are tasked with constructing a circle ( l ) which passes through points ( A ) and ( B ) and intersects circle ( k ) orthogonally. Let the points of intersection between circles ( k ) and ( l ) be ( P ) and ( Q ), and the line segment ( OA ) intersects ( l ) at another point, which we will denote as ( A' ). 2. **Understand the orthogonality condition:** For two circles to intersect orthogonally, their radii at the points of intersection must be perpendicular. This implies that if ( P ) is an intersection point, the radius ( OP ) of circle ( k ) must be tangent to circle ( l ) at ( P ). 3. **Establish geometric similarity:** Since ( OP ) is tangent to circle ( l ), the angle ( OPA' ) is the tangent-secant angle corresponding to arc ( PA' ) in circle ( l ). Therefore, ( angle OPA' = angle OAP ). This implies that triangles ( OPA' ) and ( OAP ) are similar by having a common angle ( angle OPA ) and the equality of angles ( angle OPA' ) and ( angle OAP ). 4. **Set up the similarity ratio:** From the similarity of triangles ( OPA' ) and ( OAP ), we have:    [    frac{OP}{OA} = frac{OA'}{OP}    ] 5. **Derive the relationship:** Rearrange the above proportion to solve for ( OA' ):    [    OP^2 = OA cdot OA'    ] 6. **Construct point ( A' ):** Using the known distances ( OA ) and ( OP ), construct ( OA' ) by finding the fourth proportional. This involves using the relationship derived ( OP^2 = OA cdot OA' ) to determine the exact length of ( OA' ). 7. **Place ( A' ) correctly:** Measure this length along the ray from ( O ) through ( A ) to locate the point ( A' ). 8. **Construct the orthogonal circle ( l ):** Finally, draw circle ( l ) passing through points ( A ), ( B ), and ( A' ). 9. **Verify orthogonality:** Since the described construction satisfies the proportion ( OP^2 = OA cdot OA' ) and the angles agree, circle ( l ) intersects circle ( k ) orthogonally at ( P ). 10. **Conclusion:** The constructed circle ( l ) is the required circle that passes through points ( A ) and ( B ) and intersects circle ( k ) orthogonally.

This handles the sum equations ( sumlimits_{i=1}^k x_i^j = 0 ) for ( j = 3, 5, ldots, 19 ). 8. For the other condition, consider monitoring the final equation  ( sumlimits_{i=1}^k x_i^{21} = 1 ). 9. Use ( k = 21 ), specifically 21 distinct 21st roots of unity ( omega^0, omega^1, omega^2, ldots, omega^{20} ). 10. Hence, we have:    [sum_{i=0}^{20} omega^{21} = 21 = 1]   All significant contributions going to zero otherwise. 11. Therefore, the complete ( k = 21 ) matches, proving existence in 21 roots representations.    Conclusion: The system has a solution for ( k = 21 ).

Around the traditional Chinese festival Qingming Festival, a tea dealer's statistics on the sales of four types of packaged Taicha (with the same selling price and profit) are shown in the table below.

The statistical measure that influences the dealer's decision is ( ). | Packaging | A   | B   | C   | D   | |||||| | Sales (boxes) | 15 | 22 | 18 | 10 | A: Median B: Mean C: Mode D: Variance","output":"To determine which statistical measure influenced the dealer's decision to increase the purchase quantity of the packaged Taicha of type B, we need to consider each option given: - **Median**: The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest. For the sales data (10, 15, 18, 22), the median would be the average of 15 and 18, which is 16.5. However, this doesn't specifically highlight type B. - **Mean**: The mean is the average of the data set. For the sales data, the mean would be calculated as (10 + 15 + 18 + 22) / 4 = 65 / 4 = 16.25. Again, this doesn't specifically highlight type B. - **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. In this case, each type of packaged Taicha has a unique sales number, so there's no repeating value, making it seem like mode isn't directly applicable. However, the decision to increase the purchase quantity of type B suggests the dealer is focusing on the highest sales figure, which is a unique interpretation of \\"mode\\" in this context. - **Variance**: Variance measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average value. Calculating variance involves squaring the difference between each data point and the mean, then averaging those squared differences. Variance doesn't directly indicate a preference for type B either. Given the unique interpretation required, the closest statistical measure that could influence the dealer's decision, based on the information provided, is the dealer's focus on the highest sales figure, which could be loosely interpreted as looking for the \\"mode\\" in terms of the most desirable outcome (highest sales) rather than its traditional definition.

Since m and n are not necessarily intersecting, when m, n subseteq alpha and m parallel beta and n parallel beta, it does not necessarily imply that alpha parallel beta. Therefore, proposition ② is false. 3. From m perp alpha and m parallel n, it implies that n perp alpha. Also, given n perp beta, we have alpha parallel beta. Therefore, proposition ③ is true. 4. As m and n are skew lines, when m parallel alpha, m parallel beta, n parallel alpha, and n parallel beta, it follows that alpha parallel beta. Therefore, proposition ④ is true.

The exponent of x, which is frac{m}{n}, to be zero to ensure that x does not appear in the function (since any non-zero power of x would affect symmetry about the y-axis).

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that no point is joined to all 99 other points in the graph. 2. **Illustrate the contradiction:**    Take any arbitrary point ( X ). Using our assumption, ( X ) cannot be joined to all 99 other points, meaning there exists at least one point ( Y ) not joined to ( X ). 3. **Construct a specific set of four points:**    Take four arbitrary points, say ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ):    - By our assumption, chosen arbitrarily, there exists ( B ) not joined to ( A ).    - Similarly, there exists ( D ) not joined to ( C ).    This set ( {A, B, C, D} ) then has pairs ( (A, B) ) and ( (C, D) ) such that these pairs are not joined by edges. According to our condition, it is necessary for one point among ( {A, B, C, D} ) to be connected to the other three. Clearly, this set does not satisfy the condition — a contradiction. 4. **Conclude existence of at least one such point:**    Since our initial assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Hence, there must be at least one point, call it ( X_1 ), that is joined to all 99 other points. 5. **Find additional points similarly joined to remaining points:**    Repeat the argument for the remaining 99 points, excluding ( X_1 ):    - Select another point ( X_2 ) from these 99 points. The point ( X_2 ) is joined to ( X_1 ) (since ( X_1 ) is connected to all other points including ( X_2 )), hence ( X_2 ) must be joined to the other 98 points.     6. **Iterate the process:**    Continue this process iteratively for ( X_3, X_4, ldots, X_{96} ).     - Each new ( X_i ) is joined to all other previous ( X ) points and their respective remaining points, maintaining the property. 7. **Determination of minimal sufficient points:**    - Once we have chosen ( X_1, X_2, ..., X_{96} ), we are left with 4 points unassigned.    - By the same rationale, select ( X_{97} ), which must be a point joined to the other three and therefore joined to all 99 other points.

So the total cost of the compound is: Total cost = 100 pounds * 4.25/pound = 425 The cost of the limestone is 3 per pound, and the cost of the shale mix is 5 per pound. So the total cost of the ingredients can also be expressed as: Total cost = L * 3/pound + S * 5/pound Since the total cost is 425, we can write: 3L + 5S = 425  (Equation 2) Now we have a system of two equations with two variables (Equation 1 and Equation 2).

Clearly, we can choose this interval, and it satisfies the condition since there are no other intervals to intersect with. Thus, (leftlfloor frac{1+1}{2} rightrfloor = 1) interval can be chosen. 2. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume that for some (k geq 1), from the sets (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k), we can choose (leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightrfloor) intervals such that they belong to pairwise different sets and no two of these intervals intersect.    - We need to show that from the sets (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{k+1}), we can choose (leftlfloor frac{k+2}{2} rightrfloor) intervals with the same properties. 3. **Choosing the Interval with the Smallest Right Endpoint:**    - Consider the interval (I) with the smallest right endpoint among all intervals in (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{k+1}). Suppose (I) belongs to the set (A_m).    - Remove (I) and all intervals in (A_m). Also, remove any interval that intersects with (I) from the remaining sets. Let the resulting sets be (A_1', A_2', ldots, A_{k+1}'). 4. **Counting the Remaining Intervals:**    - After removing (I) and the intervals that intersect with (I), each set (A_i') (for (i neq m)) will have at least (i-1) intervals remaining because (I) can intersect with at most one interval from each set (A_i).    - Thus, the remaining structure is similar to having (k-1) sets with (i-1) intervals each, which is equivalent to the structure of (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{k-1}). 5. **Applying the Inductive Hypothesis:**    - By the inductive hypothesis, from the sets (A_1', A_2', ldots, A_{k-1}'), we can choose (leftlfloor frac{k-1+1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{k}{2} rightrfloor) intervals such that they belong to pairwise different sets and no two of these intervals intersect.    - Including the interval (I) that we initially chose, we now have (leftlfloor frac{k}{2} rightrfloor + 1 = leftlfloor frac{k+2}{2} rightrfloor) intervals that satisfy the required conditions. 6. **Conclusion:**    - By induction, the statement holds for all (n geq 1).

Assuming ( y ) is real, given the nature of the equation, it's challenging to solve ( y(y^2 + 1) = -2sqrt{3} ) directly without numerical methods or further simplification.

Problem 1: Calculate (2+3) circledast (0+3) 1. According to the problem, we need to find (2+3) circledast (0+3). 2. By the provided property (iii), we know:    [    (a circledast b) + (c circledast d) = (a + c) circledast (b + d)    ]    So, we can rewrite the expression:    [    (5) circledast (3) = (2 circledast 0) + (3 circledast 3)    ] 3.

(2) According to the condition ③ where f(x)>0 when x>1, let us take any x_2>x_1>0. Therefore, frac{x_2}{x_1}>1, which implies that fleft(frac{x_2}{x_1}right)>0.   Hence, f(x_2) = fleft(x_1 cdot frac{x_2}{x_1}right) = f(x_1) + fleft(frac{x_2}{x_1}right), which implies f(x_2)>f(x_1). Therefore, f(x) is an increasing function on (0, +infty).

In the specific case of a trapezoid, it becomes a rectangle, since it has an axis of symmetry. 4. **Properties of the rectangle formed by the midpoints:**    - Given (ABCD) is a trapezoid, and (E), (F), (G), (H) are the midpoints of sides (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) respectively.    - The segment we seek is (FG), the line connecting the midpoints of the bases. 5. **Relation to the midline:**    - By definition, the midline (middle segment) of a trapezoid, which connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (E) and (H), equals the average of the two bases ((AB) and (CD)), divided by 2. The given problem provides that this midline is equal to 5.    Therefore, the length of the segment (FG) (joining the midpoints of the bases (AB) and (CD)) is equal to the length of the midline because, in the Varignon parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. 6. **Conclusion:**    - Since the midline is 5, and according to the problem, the length of the segment joining the midpoints of the bases is also 5.
