He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it?

Forced to rush back from their traditional oration at the annual Lord Mayor's Banquet, the high-stakes political landscape is proving tumultuous. Outspoken Speaker John Bercow has vociferously condemned the government ministers for creating a 'sorry saga.' This event has sparked discourse across the nation, catching the eye of media and public alike, with many hanging in the balance as the UK navigates a significant crossroads in its legislative journey. The urgency of the ongoing parliamentary saga has been further heightened by the Home Secretary's plea to MPs. The minister emphasized the necessity to support the proposed pan-Europe law and order measures. These critical procedures are in the immediate pipeline, with the unforgiving deadline of December 1 for the UK to decide whether to continue participation or rejoin the package.  In a further bid to encourage backing, the Home Secretary issued a stern reminder - EU co-operation is fundamentally needed to bring criminals to justice. With cross-border crime rates and threats escalating, the undeniable benefits of sharing resources and intelligence between countries were underscored as paramount in maintaining and enhancing national security. However, critics argue that the cooperative agreement comes at too high a cost. With voices growing louder, there is a deep-seated concern that the current stipulations make it alarmingly easy for Britons to be extradited for unfair trials abroad. Critics have long stressed the need for a policy overhaul, fearing that British citizens' rights face potential dilution under these pan-European measures. With the Prime Minister facing a potential defeat, the coming days carry grave significance for the future of UK legislation. As every vote inches the country closer to a decisive verdict, both supporters and detractors are eager to see the outcome, ultimately determining how justice will be served and how Britain will continue to interact with its European neighbours. The unfolding saga underscores the importance of intelligent, careful decision-making in today's political arena. As the deadline looms closer, it is clear that key decisions need to be made. From balancing domestic concerns to maintaining transnational harmonisation, the challenge that lies ahead is not an easy one.

In this case, the man is creating a three-dimensional sculpture using sand as his medium, so it can be considered a sand statue.  3. As the man is working on creating a very large, intricate sand sculpture, it can be concluded that he is responsible for making a detailed sand statue.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The protected cruiser is a type of naval cruiser of the late 19th century, so known because its armoured deck offered protection for vital machine spaces from fragments caused by exploding shells above. Protected cruisers were an alternative to the armoured cruisers, which also had a belt of armour along the sides.  - A warship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare. Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state. As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew. Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations.  - A battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a capital ship built in the first half of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and armament to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.  - The capital ships of a navy are its most important warships; they are generally the larger ships when compared to other warships in their respective fleet. A capital ship is generally a leading or a primary ship in a naval fleet.  - Pre-dreadnought battleships were sea-going battleships built between the mid- to late 1880s and 1905, before the launch of . Pre-dreadnoughts replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in barbettes (open or with armored gunhouses) supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons. They were powered by coal-fuelled triple-expansion steam engines.  - The armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered. Varying in size, it was distinguished from other types of cruiser by its belt armorthick iron (or later steel) plating on much of the hull to protect the ship from shellfire much like that on battleships. The first armored cruiser, the Imperial Russian Navy's , was launched in 1873 and combined sail and steam propulsion. By the 1890s cruisers had abandoned sail and took on a modern appearance.  - A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of large caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A cruiser is a type of warship. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the Age of Sail, the term \\"cruising\\" referred to certain kinds of missions  independent scouting, commerce protection, or raiding  fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the \\"cruising warships\\" of a fleet.  - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.  - The Grand Fleet was the main fleet of the British Royal Navy during the First World War.  - HMS Defence was a Minotaur - class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century , the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy . She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau . The ship was transferred to the Grand Fleet in January 1915 and remained there for the rest of her career . Defence was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland , the largest naval battle of the war . Escorting the main body of the Grand Fleet , the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she attempted to engage a disabled German light cruiser . She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine . The fire from that explosion spread to the ship 's secondary magazines , which exploded in turn . There were no survivors .  - A light cruiser is a type of small- or medium-sized warship. The term is a shortening of the phrase \\"light armored cruiser\\", describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser: a protective belt and deck. Prior to this smaller cruisers had been of the protected cruiser model, possessing armored decks only.

According to the latest scientific discovery,humans are able to live up to the age of 120 or perhaps even longer.     Several recent studies showed that our life span can be extended far beyond normal limits.Cynthia Kenyon,a professor at the University of California in San Francisco doubled the life of a worm from two weeks to a month.By changing the function of a single gene,known as daf-2,the scientist not only added extra days to the worm's life but also kept it a healthy as worms which were half its age.     There are two similar genes in the bodies of mammals.By changing the function of on gene,scientists extended the life of a mouse by 1 8 per cent(or 4.5 months).Another gene is called IGF-1.Researchers still don't know how it affects our body.But by reducing its functions the life of a mouse increases by 33 per cent for 8.6 months).The average life span of a mouse is 26 months.     In the experiment of extending life,an ancient saying,\\"you are what you eat.\\" also seems to  be true.Vegetables contain fewer calories than meat,and help to prolong life,scientists say. Research has found that taking in fewer calories affects our lives in a similar way to reducing IGF-1.     US biologist John Phelan suggests low calorie diets could increase human life span,but there is no proof yet.     Researchers are still waiting for the results of a study started in 1987.Monkeys are fed with low calorie food to see what happens.A monkey's typical life span is 40 years,so there is a little while to wait.     In China,average,life expectancy has now reached 70,double that of 1949. Increasing the length of our lives may bring us closer to the dreams of our ancient emperors.But it may also cause social problems such as housing and employment,social scientists have warned.

Article: There's no place in the world like Venice, Italy. Called the City of Water, Venice was built about 1,500 years ago. It's made up of 118 tiny islands in the Adriatic Sea. The area, however, may be in over its head. But now scientists have a new plan to save the city. Because the city was built on soft soil, it has been sinking under the pressure of its own weight. Scientists estimate that Venice sinks at a rate of nearly 2 inches every 100 years. Rising sea levels could make Venice go under even faster, some experts say. Earth's temperature is slowly increasing. That is causing sea ice to melt, which makes the world's waters rise, they say. To keep the city afloat, experts want to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. The liquid would expand the sand under the city, which would help support the islands, explains lead scientist Giuseppe Gambolati. Experts are rushing to save Venice because of its rich history. The city was once a strong sea power. \\"Many famous artists and opera singers have come from Venice. Some of the world's greatest paintings can be found on the city's museum walls,\\" explains Melissa Conn, who is a director of Save Venice Inc. While scientists work to get their water-pumping plan approved, Venice's residents go about their normal routines. When the tide rolls in, the locals have ways of keeping everyone dry. Cafe owners move tables to higher ground, and hotels pass out high boots to guests. Still, dealing with the rising water does not give the city's residents a sinking feeling, just ask Erla Zwingle.

The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Does the sentence \\"Henry VIII's wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall, built in 1514–1516 for Cardinal Wolsey, is in the basement of Main Building, and is used for entertainment.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Who had a wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Henry VIII's wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall, built in 1514–1516 for Cardinal Wolsey, is in the basement of Main Building, and is used for entertainment.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"Who had a wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall?\\" The sentence contains crucial information relating to the wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall. In particular, it informs us that Henry VIII had a wine cellar in the Palace, and also provides additional context such as the wine cellar's purpose and history. The following points from the sentence can be used to answer the question: 1. Henry VIII: The sentence begins by explicitly stating that the wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall belonged to Henry VIII, the former King of England. Hence, it directly answers the question concerning the owner of the wine cellar. 2. Built for Cardinal Wolsey: The sentence also mentions that the wine cellar was built in 1514–1516 for Cardinal Wolsey, a prominent English churchman and statesman during that time. This information is significant because it adds to our understanding of its origin and reveals that Henry VIII was not the original owner. Therefore, while Henry VIII possessed the wine cellar, it was Cardinal Wolsey for whom it was initially constructed. 3. Basement of Main Building: This sentence highlights the location of the wine cellar within the Palace of Whitehall. This detail does not necessarily answer the question about the wine cellar owner, but it helps to create a clearer image of where the wine cellar is situated. 4. Used for entertainment: Lastly, the sentence provides information about the purpose or use of Henry VIII's wine cellar. This detail does not directly answer the question about who owned the wine cellar, but it provides further context in describing its function within the Palace of Whitehall. In conclusion, the given sentence provides a valid answer to the question of who had a wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall by identifying Henry VIII as the owner. It also adds supplementary information regarding its construction for Cardinal Wolsey, the location of the wine cellar within the palace, and its purpose as an entertainment space, thereby enriching our understanding of the topic."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1815, Edmond DantÃ©s, Second Mate of a French merchant vessel, and his friend Fernand Mondego, representative of the shipping company, seek medical help at Elba for their ailing captain.

In Marseille, the company owner Morrell commends Edmond for his bravery, promoting him to captain over First Mate Danglars, who gave Edmond explicit orders not to land at Elba.

Edmond escapes, and turns to Fernand for help, but Fernand holds him up and turns him over to the pursuing gendarmes. Edmond is consigned to the island prison and its sadistic warden, Armand Dorleac.

OPT: (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","output":"In addressing this question, we need to analyze the situation in depth. The scenario presented is of a man and a woman standing outside in a parking lot, talking to a reporter with a camera and sound person recording everything. At first, this could possibly sound like an event that we commonly associate with news reporters or journalists doing field work, in almost any sort of environment such as a parking lot. This could typically involve interviewing people - it could be any variety of events, subjects or people, such as experts, public figures, or even ordinary people and witnesses in the case of a certain incident or event. However, the question asks us to conclude that \\"A news crew interviews witnesses to a crime.\\" Here, the keywords are \\"witnesses\\" and \\"crime.\\" The original scenario makes no mention of a crime taking place. There is no definitive context suggesting that these people are witnesses or that they are being interviewed due to their witnessing a crime. The reporter could be speaking to them about many possible subjects, such as their opinions on a local issue, an event they are participating in, or maybe even a feature story.  So, we have two unknowns here, the presence of a crime and if the man and woman are witnesses to said crime. Without this explicit information, this leads us into the territory of assumption. Another unknown variable is the nature of the crew. While it does sound like a common setup for a news crew, we aren't told whether they are in fact a news crew. Therefore, drawing a definitive conclusion that they are indeed a news crew interviewing witnesses to a crime can't be held up on the basis of the given information only. Hence, the appropriate response to this question would be: (B). It is not possible to tell. This is because, even though the scenario suggests a situation that typically appears in news reporting, there aren't enough specific details to definitively conclude that a news crew is interviewing witnesses to a crime. Without more information stating or indicating explicitly that a crime was committed, and the pair are witnesses to the crime, confirming this conclusion would be an assumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette!

Solve this instance: Problem: two numbers are respectively 71 % and 80 % more than a third number . the percentage that is first of the second is ?  Options: a ) 4 % , b ) 5 % , c ) 6 % , d ) 7 % , e ) 8 % Student:","output":"Yes, I understand the problem. Let's solve the question. Given, two numbers A and B are respectively 71% and 80% more than a third number C. So, A = C + 71% of C = C (1 + 0.71) = 1.71C And B = C + 80% of C = C (1 + 0.80) = 1.80C Now, we need to find the percentage that A is of B. We can set up the fraction A/B and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. A/B = (1.71C) / (1.80C) = 1.71 / 1.80 = 0.95 (approx) Now convert this to percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.95 x 100 = 95% This means A is 95% of B. But the question asks for \\"the percentage that is the first of the second\\", which means we need to find the difference between 100% and 95%. 100% - 95% = 5% Thus, the correct answer is option b) 5%."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: Most of the staff you'll see in bars and hotels during the summer return to their homes on mainland Greece until the following year. Here is a hypothesis: There isn't much work after the summer so the staff leaves. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise, let's examine the given information and logic step by step. Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that most staff in bars and hotels during the summer return to their homes on mainland Greece until the following year. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that there isn't much work after the summer, so the staff leaves. Step 3: Establish a connection between the premise and the hypothesis The hypothesis implies that a lack of work after the summer is the reason for the staff leaving. The premise tells us that the staff does leave after the summer, but it does not explicitly state the reason for them doing so. Step 4: Concluding Based on the information provided in the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. While it's possible that the lack of work after the summer could be the reason for the staff leaving, the premise does not explicitly provide that information. There might be other reasons for the staff leaving, such as seasonal contracts or personal reasons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does the term respect mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"No, the term \\"respect\\" does not convey the exact same meaning in both of these sentences. Although both sentences use the word \\"respect\\", the context and the nuance of the meaning are different. In the first sentence, \\"He went to law school out of respect for his father's wishes,\\" the term \\"respect\\" refers to the regard, consideration, or deference shown towards someone's ideas, opinions, or wishes. In this case, the son acknowledges his father's wishes and, as a result, he decides to enroll in law school. The term \\"respect\\" here emphasizes a form of compliance or agreement with someone's desires, especially out of admiration or esteem for that person. In the second sentence, \\"He inspires respect,\\" the term \\"respect\\" alludes to the admiration, esteem, or regard that others have for a person due to their qualities, actions, or achievements. In this context, the respect that the individual inspires in others is based on his character or the positive results that he produces. The term \\"respect\\" here focuses more on the sentiments of reverence or honor that other people direct towards that individual. So, although both sentences involve the notion of \\"respect,\\" the first sentence emphasizes one's submission or willingness to compromise in reverence to somebody else's wishes, while the second sentence accentuates the genuine admiration emerging from an individual's traits or accomplishments. Essentially, the first sentence describes an action taken because of respect, whereas the second sentence discusses the feeling of respect that is inspired by a person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.  Question: \\"In addition to repairing 150 miles of airport runways, what other impact would this plan have on air traffic?\\" Answer: \\"It would reduce travel time\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, this answer is correct. The plan also includes modernizing the nation's air traffic control system, which would help in reducing delays and travel time."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Given the context: How would you describe Riley? Choose from: * a violent person. * a peaceful person. * a weak person. Answer:","output":"Riley can be described as a violent person, though his actions may be driven by strong emotions and a sense of justice related to avenging his brother's death. While Riley's response to the situation may garner sympathy and understanding from some individuals, it cannot be denied that he has chosen to engage in violent behaviors as a means to cope with his grief and achieve what he perceives as a form of justice.  By going after the gang and attacking them, Riley demonstrates a willingness to use physical force and aggression to achieve his goals. This showcases a stark contrast to a peaceful person who would, in the same situation, likely pursue diplomacy, negotiation, or rely on the established legal system in order to address the wrongs committed against his brother. Similarly, Riley's actions also differentiate him from a weak person who might feel powerless or unable to take action in response to their brother's death. It is important to consider the broader context of Riley's actions and the underlying motivations driving him. In this case, grief and a desire for retribution likely push Riley to engage in these violent acts. While this does not excuse the violence, it does provide a deeper understanding of Riley as a complex individual who is struggling to come to terms with a profound and personal loss. In conclusion, Riley can be accurately described as a violent person in this context. His actions are driven by powerful emotions and a quest for vengeance following his brother's death. While this may be understandable to a degree, it is vital to recognize that violence is not a healthy or productive means of coping with grief or seeking justice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is evident through several key phrases and aspects found throughout the review. Let's analyze the given information to understand why the sentiment is negative. 1. The title of the review states \\"not dependable.\\" This indicates that the reviewer does not find the product reliable or trustworthy, implying dissatisfaction with its performance or durability. The phrase \\"not dependable\\" is inherently negative in nature. 2. The reviewer comments, \\"It just didn't last.\\" This statement suggests that the product failed to meet the reviewer's expectations in terms of longevity or durability. The fact that it \\"didn't last\\" indicates the reviewer's disappointment in the product, which is indicative of a negative sentiment. 3. The next sentence, \\"Got a couple of years out of it but felt that for a brand name it should not have leaked,\\" reveals that the reviewer believes their expectations were not met. It is apparent that the reviewer expected better performance from a brand-name product and is disappointed that it started leaking after just a couple of years. 4. The concluding remark, \\"It became a throw away,\\" emphasizes the negative sentiment even further.

Place the oreros in a food processor. Leave the lid open, and hit the pulse button over and over until you get your desired consistency. (II). Place the oreros in a food processor. Close the lid, and hit the pulse button over and over until you get your desired consistency.","output":"To accomplish the goal of crushing Oreos using a food processor, I would recommend following these steps, which align with option (II) from your proposed answers: 1. Preparation: First, ensure that you have a clean, dry, and functional food processor. Select the appropriate blade or disc attachment for your food processor if needed, typically a multi-purpose blade should work for crushing Oreos. 2. Quantity and pieces: The amount of Oreos you are crushing may also affect the end result. If you are crushing a large quantity, you may want to do it in smaller batches to ensure consistent texture and avoid overloading the processor. Moreover, gently break the Oreos into smaller pieces using your hands before adding them to the food processor. This will make it easier for the processor to break down the cookies. 3. Placing Oreos in the food processor: Add the Oreo pieces to the food processor, ensuring they are distributed evenly over the bottom of the container and not heaped to one side. Make sure not to overfill the food processor, and leave room for the blades to move freely. 4. Close the lid: For safety reasons and to prevent making a mess, ensure that the lid of the food processor is properly closed and locked in place. This will also create an enclosed environment, allowing the Oreos to be crushed uniformly. 5. Pulse the food processor: Turn on the food processor and start pulsing by hitting the pulse button over and over. By using the pulse setting, you can maintain better control over the texture of the crushed Oreos. Periodically stop pulsing to scrape down the sides of the container to make sure that all Oreo pieces are incorporated into the mixture. 6. Check for desired consistency: After several pulse cycles, check the consistency of the crushed Oreos. Depending on your preference or recipe requirements, you may want a fine powder, coarse crumbs, or larger chunks. Keep pulsing and checking until you achieve the desired consistency, but be careful not to overprocess, as this may turn the Oreos into a paste. 7. Transfer and store: Once you have reached the desired consistency, carefully transfer the crushed Oreos into a separate container or directly into your recipe. If you are not using them immediately, store them in an airtight container to prevent them from becoming soft or losing their crunchy texture. By following the above steps and ensuring the lid is properly closed during the process, you can achieve consistent and safely crushed Oreos using a food processor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's also got a sweet side, with unexpected turns of genuine pathos. The late, great Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely, down-on-his-luck farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"No, the answers to these two questions would not be the same, as they are addressing different aspects of coffee shops.  For Question 1, we need to explore profitability and consider factors such as average revenue, costs, and the business model.  1. Research the average revenue of coffee shops, considering factors like location, size, and target audience. 2. Analyze the costs associated with running coffee shops, including rent, ingredients, labor, and equipment. 3. Investigate the business model and scalability of coffee shops; for instance, do franchises have a higher profit margin than independent shops due to economies of scale? 4. Look for relevant financial data within the industry to determine overall profitability. 5. Consider external factors, such as market trends and competition, that could impact profitability. For Question 2, we need to examine the reasons behind Third Wave coffee shops' decision to not offer WiFi, which could be a combination of cultural and strategic factors. 1. Understand the definition of Third Wave coffee shops and their focus on quality, artisanal products, and customer experience. 2. Research the reasons behind not offering WiFi, such as encouraging more face-to-face conversations, social interaction, and overall atmosphere. 3. Explore any strategic reasons, like discouraging customers from lingering too long without purchasing additional items, thereby increasing turnover. 4. Investigate if there are any cost-related factors involved in not providing WiFi, such as avoiding high costs for high-speed internet or minimizing expenses. 5. Look at customer preferences to see if most Third Wave coffee shops patrons tend to agree with the decision to not have WiFi and whether it's a factor in the shop's appeal.

Plot title: Zombies Movie plot: In 1913, in Carlton, Pennsylvania (shot in Bulgaria), the cruel owner of the Carlton mine exploits poor immigrant children. In order to excavate a new shaft quickly, he employs a dynamite charge, but the explosion causes the mine to collapse, burying a large group of the children alive. Following his later trial for wilfully causing the death of his workers, Carlton is acquitted and the mine closed down. In present day, eighty years later, Karen Tunny has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease and has inherited his birthhome near the since-abandoned Carlton mine. She moves to the house with her daughters, Sarah and Emma. The three stop by the local market for supplies and are told by Walter, the shopkeeper, that he doesn't deliver to the area they live in. While driving, Karen has a near miss with a man crossing the road. She exits the car, looking for the man, but he's nowhere to be found. They arrive at the house and Sarah points out the blood on the door while Karen declares it's just \\"paint.\\" When Emma hears children giggling, she leaves the house, following the sound of it. Karen goes out looking for Emma and finds her in an old mine. As they try to find their way back to the house, it becomes nightfall and they get lost.

Karen is advised by Hanks to stay at home during the night, and he also tells her that there is no need to thank him for the blood smeared on his and the Tunny's door. William Carlton, the last surviving heir of the Carlton estate, which has owned the mine since 1913, is hungrily devouring property and kicking people off his own property. Meanwhile, the zombie children begin to kill, which is dismissed among the community as disappearances, though it is hinted that most of the community is aware of the presence of the children.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"While both questions are indeed focused on comparing different car brands, they are not exactly inquiring about the same information. The first question explicitly asks for a comparison between Mercedes and BMW, while the second question seeks to compare Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. To provide detailed and long answers for each question, let's evaluate these car brands based on various factors like performance, comfort, design, reliability, and technology. 1. Mercedes vs. BMW: a) Performance: Mercedes is often recognized for its smooth and comfortable ride, while BMW is known for its sporty performance and driving dynamics. BMW vehicles generally provide a more engaging driving experience compared to Mercedes cars. However, Mercedes-AMG lineup may compete with BMW M performance cars in terms of power and speed. b) Comfort: Mercedes vehicles are generally considered luxurious, providing a comfortable and quiet ride, while prioritizing the overall experience of the passenger. BMW cars may feature a sportier suspension setup, which could be slightly less comfortable than a Mercedes, but there are models like BMW 7 Series that prioritize comfort and luxury too. c) Design: Both brands have distinctive design language and aesthetics, with Mercedes often leaning towards more elegant and classy designs, while BMW focuses on muscular, agile, and sporty designs. Choosing a design between the two is subjective and depends on personal preferences. d) Reliability: In general, both Mercedes and BMW are considered premium brands, and the build quality and durability of their vehicles reflect this. However, the cost of maintenance and repair for these premium brands may be higher than for other car manufacturers. It is essential to consider the long-term cost of ownership when making a decision between the two. e) Technology: Both Mercedes and BMW have consistently been at the forefront of automotive technology. Mercedes has introduced innovative features like advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) and the proprietary MBUX infotainment system. On the other hand, BMW has consistently improved its iDrive system, making it one of the best in the industry, and investing in electrification with the BMW i models. 2. Porsche vs. BMW vs. Mercedes-Benz: a) Performance: Porsche, with its sports car heritage, typically offers the most performance-oriented vehicles in this comparison. Cars like the 911 and Cayman are known for their exceptional driving dynamics, acceleration, and handling. However, the BMW M lineup and Mercedes-AMG lineup do offer competitive performance compared to their Porsche counterparts. b) Comfort: In this comparison, Mercedes-Benz would likely take the lead in terms of comfort, followed by BMW, and then Porsche. While Porsche has made strides in comfort over the years, their primary focus is still on performance and driving dynamics, which can sometimes compromise comfort and luxury. c) Design: Design preferences are subjective, but each brand has a distinctive design language. Porsche designs are more performance-focused and timeless, BMW features sporty and aggressive designs, and Mercedes-Benz showcases elegance and luxury. d) Reliability: All three brands are considered premium, and their vehicles generally boast quality craftsmanship and durability. However, it's essential to consider the cost of maintenance and repair for each brand, as they may differ. e) Technology: As premium car manufacturers, all three brands prioritize technology and innovation. Mercedes, BMW, and Porsche each offer advanced infotainment systems, driver assistance features, and electrification options. In conclusion, while both questions inquire about the comparison of car brands, the first question specifically asks for a comparison between Mercedes and BMW, and the second question compares Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. The better brand depends on personal preferences, and factors like performance, comfort, design, reliability, and technology should be taken into consideration when making a decision between these brands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some 57 per cent of the public would be prepared to see taxes rise to protect the NHS, according to a new survey. Just over four in 10 voters said they would not. The revelation comes amid warnings that the NHS could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase spending. A clear majority of the public would be prepared to pay more tax to protect the NHS, according to a new ComRes poll. All age groups are prepared to pay more tax to protect the NHS - except 35-44 year-olds - including three in five Conservative voters and two-thirds of Labour supporters. The public also do not appear to care who provides their treatment - as long as it is free. Some 67 per cent said they did not mind if health services were run by the NHS or by privately owned businesses, provided it was free, while 30 per cent disagreed. A majority of Labour supporters - 59 per cent - say they do not mind who provides NHS services, with the working class least bothered of all. The research, carried out by ComRes for The Independent, also found that voters trust Labour more than the Conservatives on health issues, with 33 per cent backing leader Ed Miliband to protect the NHS, and 29 per cent trusting Prime Minister David Cameron. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: 'Beyond the economy and immigration, the NHS will be the key policy issue on which the 2015 general election is decided, and the fact that most Britons say they are willing to pay more tax in order to protect the NHS just goes to show the peril of being seen by voters to neglect it. 'Although traditionally it has been difficult for the Conservatives to get traction with voters on the NHS, voters seem to trust neither leader particularly to protect what is perceived as a valuable national institution.' Meanwhile, Labour's poll lead has dropped from five to two points since last month, ComRes found. Labour is on 32 per cent, down three points, the Conservatives are unchanged on 30 per cent, Ukip is up four points to 18 per cent, the Liberal Democrats are down one point to a record low of seven per cent. ComRes interviewed 1,005 British adults by telephone between June 27 and 29 to gauge public support for extra health spending and the use of private companies to deliver services. David Cameron is less trusted than Ed Miliband to protect the health service from cuts - but only just - according to the survey. The public's support for higher taxes to pay for the NHS comes after senior MPs said the health service could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase health spending. Over the weekend, former Conservative Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell called on David Cameron to boost the NHS budget as the economy recovered to avoid a crisis. He was joined by the new chair of the Health Select Committee, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who warned that it was 'hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service' if spending was not increased. Paul Burstow, a Lib Dem former health minister, meanwhile said that the NHS needed an extra £15 billion over the next five years 'if you don't want the system to collapse during the course of the next parliament'. Labour is intending to make the the NHS a key battleground at the next election and has promised a 'big offer' on health care. It is considering three options to boost NHS spending: a ring-fenced rise in national insurance contributions for employers and workers; delaying the deficit-reduction programme and a budget increase once the nation’s books have been balanced. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure to increase the NHS's budget amid warnings that the health service is facing a financial crisis. As Chancellor, Gordon Brown raised National Insurance by one per cent in 2002 to help bring Britain’s spending on health up to the European average. Some Labour figures are wary that such a pledge now could undermine Mr Miliband’s 'cost of living' agenda as higher NICs would put more pressure on family budgets. But last night Labour supporters of a major health cash promise took comfort from the ComRes findings. Patrick Diamond, a former Downing Street policy adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said: 'These poll findings demonstrate there is a real appetite among the British electorate for higher taxes to ensure the NHS remains on a sustainable financial footing. 'The key policy issue is how to make NHS spending more transparent so voters know how well the extra money is being used, combined with measures that widen choice and control over services to maintain the public consensus for a universal, taxpayer-funded NHS.'

Tennessee Many major battles of the American Civil War were fought in Tennessee—most of them Union victories. Ulysses S. Grant and the U.S. Navy captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers in February 1862. They held off the Confederate counterattack at Shiloh in April. Memphis fell to the Union in June, following a naval battle on the Mississippi River in front of the city. The Capture of Memphis and Nashville gave the Union control of the western and middle sections; this control was confirmed at the Battle of Murfreesboro in early January 1863 and by the subsequent Tullahoma Campaign. Q: During which month in 1862 did Union forces capture Memphis?","output":"Union forces captured Memphis in the month of June in 1862.

If \\"A young man is enjoying a salad for dinner in his home.\\", does it logically follow that \\"a young man is eating\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"a young man is eating\\" when given the statement \\"A young man is enjoying a salad for dinner in his home.\\" Let's break down the original statement to understand the logical connection between the two statements. The original statement contains several pieces of information: 1. A young man: This refers to the subject or main character involved in the scenario. In this case, it is a young man. 2. Is enjoying: This verbal phrase is used to describe the action or activity that the young man is participating in. \\"Enjoying\\" suggests that the young man is taking pleasure in the activity and is actively engaged in it. It also implies that the activity involves consumption or use of something. 3. A salad: This part of the statement identifies the object of the young man's enjoyment. The word \\"salad\\" is a type of dish predominantly consisting of a mixture of various vegetables or fruit, often containing a dressing or toppings. In the context of this statement, \\"salad\\" is the item being consumed by the young man. 4. For dinner: This prepositional phrase provides additional information about the context of the event. \\"For dinner\\" indicates that the young man is enjoying his salad as part of his evening meal. 5. In his home: Lastly, this prepositional phrase identifies the location where the young man is enjoying the salad. \\"In his home\\" suggests that he is in a familiar, comfortable, and private environment. Given the information and the context provided in the original statement, we can deduce that the young man is engaged in the act of consuming a salad as his dinner within the confines of his home. Therefore, it can be logically concluded that \\"a young man is eating.\\"  In summary, the phrase \\"a young man is enjoying a salad for dinner in his home\\" indeed implies that \\"a young man is eating\\" as it is evident within the provided context that the young man is actively engaged in consuming a salad during his evening meal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Early Asian writings on architecture include the Kao Gong Ji of China from the 7th–5th centuries BCE; the Shilpa Shastras of ancient India and Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra of Sri Lanka. What was written in 4th century BCE? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"While the exact content of architectural writings from the 4th century BCE may not be specifically known or preserved, it is important to understand the context of architectural development during this period in various parts of Asia. This will shed light on the kind of architectural knowledge and practices that may have influenced the writings of the time. One possibility regarding architectural writings from the 4th century BCE could be related to the development of Chinese architecture, mentioned in the context of the Kao Gong Ji. The Kao Gong Ji is one of the earliest known documents on Chinese architecture and classic works of art from the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE). The architectural principles and techniques identified in this document may have been refined or expanded upon during the 4th century. Knowledge of building wooden structures, use of bricks, and implementation of religious and landscape structures like pagodas and gardens were likely a part of these Chinese texts. In ancient India, the Shilpa Shastras were treatises dealing with the science of art and architecture, and were developed over several centuries, beginning from the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE). The 4th century BCE was around the time of the Maurya dynasty in India, under which urban planning, public buildings, and palaces flourished with well-defined principles. As a result, the architectural writings of this period may have focused on temple architecture, urban planning, and palace design, incorporating geometry, proportion, and symbolism. The Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra, a treatise on architecture in ancient Sri Lanka, has its roots in prehistoric times and is believed to have emerged around the 3rd–1st century BCE. Architectural writings from the 4th century BCE in the region likely dealt with aspects such as sacred geometry, space planning, and construction techniques inspired by Indian Shastra traditions. Additionally, outside of explicit written texts, we should also consider the architectural knowledge and advancements during the 4th century BCE in other regions of Asia, such as Persia and Greece. The Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE) in Persia was well-established at this time, and significant architectural feats like the city of Persepolis provide a framework for the potential architectural concepts being discussed or documented during that period. Similarly, the influence of the Hellenistic period in Greece (323–31 BCE), during which architecture flourished, may have been captured in the architectural writings in Asia as new ideas and styles made their way between cultures. In summary, although specific architectural writings from the 4th century BCE may not be directly known, the advancements and trends in the architecture of that time suggest discussions around principles of construction, urban planning, temple architecture, and evolving design in relation to the different cultures and regions within Asia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Friday in case of a government shutdown:            10) Water the plants. You may be gone for a while.            9) Update your pay information.            8) Make sure your phone number is current in the system.            7) Subscribe to FederalNewsRadio alerts and emails at your HOME address            6) From Dixie @ DoD: \\"Have a go at writing (your) respective Congressional member and letting them know what we do and how we feel.\\"            5) Learn from Senior Corresondent Mike Causey's experience: Write down those passwords you carry in your head and save them someplace safe. It's easy to forget them without frequent use.            4) Update email and phone out of office message.            3) Throw out what you have in the office fridge. Replace it when you come back.            2) And no matter what happens, plan on showing up for work Monday, at least to turn in your BlackBerry.      1) Turn in your time card.      And the final tip comes from CNN's Bob Constantini. He said federal employees who ride the morning MARC train with him said they \\"haven't heard that much from their bosses about what to do. They were told to turn in their timecards today to make it faster, perhaps, that they might get paid.\\"      What's on your Pre-Shutdown To-Do List? ||||| Social Web      At Web's Social Hive For Government Workers, A Mix Of Disillusion, Hope      Enlarge image i Alex Wong / Getty Images Alex Wong / Getty Images      As the government shutdown started to seem inevitable, the talk on the public employee social networking site govloop.com quickened. It started with the practical, like a top ten list of what government workers should do in case of a shutdown: Things like water your plants, fill out your timecard and make plans to show up at the office on Monday to, in the least, turn in your Blackberry. Then as the sun set on Friday, it turned to the comical: Like Conan O'Brien, one member suggested, govies should stop shaving and grow a beard as long as the furlough lasts.      But with the threat looming large, some members of the site, turned serious. A good deal of the sentiments expressed dealt with the fact that these people were worker bees who felt stuck and powerless facing a Congress playing politics and an American public who thinks government workers are fat and lazy.      Danielle Blumenthal asked how the threat of shutdown affected other members' commitment to public service.      Henry Brown responded by saying it was the \\"FINAL straw in forcing me into scheduling my retirement.\\"      Karen, on the site's Facebook page, said she'd rather the government shutdown than keep riding a wave of uncertainty \\"every two weeks.\\"      Peter Sperry? He took the philosophical view:      It is an unfortunate part of the politcal process but a small price to pay for living in a democracy. I am sure the Chinese government will never shut down and the Libyan government seems able to remain open but I would not trade their system for ours.      Govloop, known by some as the Facebook for government workers, was founded by Steve Ressler, who spent more than five years as a government worker himself. He left the public sector after govloop became successful enough that he had to dedicate himself full-time to the site. He started the site in June of 2008 and now has some 42,000 members.      He said the threat of a government shutdown has energized the community.      \\"Most public servants want to do good,\\" said Ressler. \\"They're passionate about what they do and they want to give back.\\"      He said as members mulled a shutdown, the site created mentoring relationships where workers who had been through the '95 shutdown or the state government workers who had been laid off by the hundreds shared tips and experiences with the government newbies.      In some ways, said Ressler, the site has also humanized the public worker.      To that end, Kerry Ann O'Connor proposed that if the furlough did come, the feds should take the opportunity to reconnect with the American public. Tell your stories, O'Connor extolled.      \\"What people don't understand is that federal workers are people, too,\\" said Ressler. As Friday came to an end and a deal seemed impossible, news that Z-Burger in Washington, D.C. was giving away free burgers to federal employees worked its way through the network.      \\"If you went out there, there's probably a line full of people you went to high school with, a neighbor, someone on the same kickball team as you,\\" said Ressler.      At the eleventh hour, Democrats and Republicans came to an agreement and averted the first government shutdown in more than 15 years.

Bettel's team was sworn in Wednesday. It will remain much the same as the outgoing government, with Socialist veteran Jean Asselborn holding on to his position as foreign minister and Pierre Gramegna as finance minister.      The parties control 31 of the 60 seats in the Luxembourg legislature. ||||| Luxembourg is to become the first country in the world to scrap fares on all public transport.      The plans, introduced by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel's coalition government, will see trains, trams and buses run free of charge from next summer.      Bettel, who took office for a second term on Wednesday, made environmental protection a key part of his election campaign.      His Democratic Party will form a government with the left-wing Socialist Workers’ party and the Greens.      Currently, fares are capped at €2 for anything up to two hours of travel, which covers most journeys in the 2,585 km² nation.      Luxembourg City, the landlocked country's capital, is home to around 107,000 but sees 400,000 commuters cross its borders every day to work, causing some of the worst congestion in Europe.      Part of the cost for the initiative will be footed by removing a tax break for commuters.      Luxembourg has previously shown it has a forward-looking attitude towards transport — over the summer, the government introduced free transport for young people under the age of 20.      Secondary school students are also provided free shuttle services between their places of study and homes. ||||| Luxembourg to become first country to make all public transport free      Luxembourg is set to become the first country in the world to make all its public transport free.      Fares on trains, trams and buses will be lifted next summer under the plans of the re-elected coalition government led by Xavier Bettel, who was sworn in for a second term as prime minister on Wednesday.      Bettel, whose Democratic party will form a government with the leftwing Socialist Workers’ party and the Greens, had vowed to prioritise the environment during the recent election campaign.      On top of the transport pledge, the new government is also considering legalising cannabis, and introducing two new public holidays.      Luxembourg City, the capital of the small Grand Duchy, suffers from some of the worst traffic congestion in the world.      It is home to about 110,000 people, but a further 400,000 commute into the city to work. A study suggested that drivers in the capital spent an average of 33 hours in traffic jams in 2016.      While the country as a whole has 600,000 inhabitants, nearly 200,000 people living in France, Belgium and Germany cross the border every day to work in Luxembourg.      Luxembourg has increasingly shown a progressive attitude to transport. This summer, the government brought in free transport for every child and young person under the age of 20. Secondary school students can use free shuttles between their institution and their home. Commuters need only pay €2 (£1.78) for up to two hours of travel, which in a country of just 999 sq miles (2,590 sq km) covers almost all journeys.      Now, from the start of 2020 all tickets will be abolished, saving on the collection of fares and the policing of ticket purchases.

A decision has yet to be taken on what to do about first- and second-class compartments on trains.      Bettel only just scraped back into government in the recent election. Opinion polls before October’s poll had indicated that the Christian Social People’s party (CSV) – led for 19 years by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – would end Bettel’s five years as prime minister.      The CSV, however, lost seats, while the Greens gained three seats. The result gave the coalition 31 seats in the 60-seat chamber.      The policy of the new government that has caused the most debate, however, has been that of legalising the purchase, possession and consumption of cannabis for recreational use. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Luxembourg is set to become the first country in the world to make all public transport free.

This article: In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose monument says they died at 51?, what is it ?

Q:A builder looking for wood to build a new home is likely to visit what location? - own home - grocery store - boat - carpet - lumberyard  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is lumberyard.  A builder looking for wood to build a new home is most likely to visit a lumberyard because this is the location where various types and sizes of wood are readily available for purchase. Lumberyards specialize in supplying construction materials, including wood, to builders, contractors, and homeowners alike. Visiting one's own home would not be the ideal choice for the builder, as the home may not have the required quantity or type of wood necessary for constructing a new home. Additionally, using wood from one's home might weaken the structure or compromise its aesthetic appeal. A grocery store is not a relevant location for sourcing wood for construction purposes. While grocery stores may stock some basic household items and tools, their primary focus is on providing food and consumer products. Boats are not a sensible source of wood for building homes either. It is true that boats are often made of wood or have wooden components; however, dismantling a boat to obtain wood for constructing a house would not only be time-consuming and inefficient but it could also damage the boat beyond repair. Moreover, the type of wood used in boats may not always be suitable for residential construction. A carpet store would primarily sell carpets, rugs, and other flooring materials, not wood. While they sometimes offer a selection of engineered wood flooring or other wood-based products, such materials are more suitable for interior finishing rather than the structural needs of building a new home. In conclusion, when a builder needs wood to construct a new home, a lumberyard is the most appropriate choice amongst the provided options. Lumberyards can cater to various construction requirements by offering a wide range of wood products, suitable for different aspects of home building. This ensures that the builder can source all their wood needs efficiently and effectively in a single location."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Know what you are looking for if you are shopping in the produce section.","output":"In the next part of this paragraph, the author would likely provide more tips and suggestions on how to save money at Whole Foods. Here is how it might continue: Consider shopping during sale events. Whole Foods often holds sales and offers promotions on various items. To maximize your savings, plan your grocery trips around these events. Buy in bulk for non-perishable items. Whole Foods has a bulk section for grains, nuts, and other non-perishable items. Buying in bulk can save you money, as it's usually cheaper per unit. Just make sure to store the items properly to prevent spoilage. Choose store brands when possible. Whole Foods' 365 Everyday Value brand is often less expensive than name-brand products. Opt for these items when you can to save without compromising on quality. Take advantage of the weekly sales flyer. Check the store's weekly sales flyer or visit their website to see featured sales items. Incorporate those items into your shopping list to save on groceries. Buy seasonal produce. Buying fruits and vegetables when they are in season is typically cheaper and provides fresher products. Make a habit of selecting seasonal produce to save on your grocery bill. Stick to a shopping list. Create a list of the items you need before heading to the store, and stick to it.

Questions: You would hold what tool used to make plants wet by a handle? Options: - coins - baseball bat - coffeepot - watering can - carry object A:","output":"To answer this question, the main hint is \\"tool used to make plants wet\\". With this context, I will go through each option to see if it matches the given criteria.  1. Coins - Coins are a type of currency and do not hold water or moisten plants. This can't be the answer. 2. Baseball bat - A baseball bat is a sports equipment, used for hitting in games like baseball and softball. It also doesn’t fulfill the criterion of watering plants. So, this option is not correct. 3. Coffeepot - While a coffeepot can technically hold water, it is typically used for making and serving coffee, not for watering plants. This is probably not the answer. 4. Watering can - A watering can is used to water plants by scattering water over them. This aligns perfectly with the given scenario, making it highly likely to be the correct option. 5. Carry object - This is too general and doesn't specify anything about making plants wet. This also can't be the answer. After going through each option and matching them against the question's requirements, I conclude that the most suitable option is 'Watering Can'. A watering can is specifically designed to hold water and it is used for the purpose of watering plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Pick your answer from: a). No; b). Yes;","output":"a). No; The suggested answer provided doesn't comprehensively address the question asked, which is about what the Royal Family does. Instead, the answer provided is focused on a specific event that took place in 2013 and discusses the issuance of Letters Patent relating to titles and styles of additional members of the Royal Family. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question \\"What does the Royal Family do?\\" would be as follows: The Royal Family, primarily consisting of the monarch and their immediate family members, plays a crucial role in both representing and supporting the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries as figureheads and symbols of continuity and stability. Their duties and activities can be divided into several categories. 1. Ceremonial and Public Duties: The Royal Family participates in numerous ceremonial events, such as the State Opening of Parliament, national celebrations, and other events, like the Trooping the Colour, Royal Ascot, and the Remembrance Day Service. These events help to unite the nation by reminding citizens of their shared history, values, and traditions. 2. Charitable Work: The Royal Family members individually support hundreds of charities and organizations both in the United Kingdom and abroad. They often act as patrons, help raise funds, and bring public attention to the causes they support. The Queen, for example, is a patron of over 600 organizations, while The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, has established numerous charitable initiatives, including The Prince's Trust, which provides support for young people facing challenges in life. 3. Official Engagements: Members of the Royal Family undertake official engagements, such as opening ceremonies, visiting schools, hospitals, and military bases, as well as meeting foreign dignitaries, attending state functions, and participating in diplomatic missions abroad. These visits and engagements help to build relationships, strengthen communities, and promote goodwill between nations. 4. Supporting the Armed Forces: The Royal Family has strong connections with the UK Armed Forces, with several members having served or currently serving in various capacities. They honor the commitments of the armed forces, attend military ceremonies, and associate with relevant charities that support servicemen and women and their families. 5. Promoting British Interests: The Royal Family promotes British values, businesses, and trade interests both domestically and internationally. Members of the Royal Family often participate in trade missions and diplomatic visits, helping to foster business connections and open doors for British industries. In summary, while the answer provided in the question does touch upon the Royal Family's roles, it is not comprehensive or detailed enough to provide a clear picture of their duties and responsibilities. Instead, a more appropriate response would acknowledge their ceremonial, charitable, diplomatic, military, and promotional roles, as described above."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

Neutral Milk Hotel was an American indie rock band formed in Ruston, Louisiana by singer, guitarist, and songwriter Jeff Mangum in the late 1980s. The band is noted for its experimental sound, abstract lyrics and eclectic instrumentation. The first release under the Neutral Milk Hotel moniker was the 1994 EP Everything Is, a short collection of tracks featuring Mangum. The band's second album, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, released in 1998 and also produced by Robert Schneider, is notable as a critically acclaimed and widely popular album. It is largely inspired by the story of Holocaust victim Anne Frank. During live performances, including the one released under the title Live at Jittery Joe's, Mangum has described some of the songs of this album as based on urgent, recurring dreams he had of a Jewish family during World War II. The album was highly praised by critics for its wildly inventive instrumentation and Mangum's provocative and impassioned lyrics. Although it was met with scant response from the general public when it was released, the recording has continued to gain momentum in indie music circles, selling over 300,000 copies, according to Merge Records. However, the record (along with the year of constant touring that succeeded it) took its toll on Mangum. The band abruptly went on hiatus, turning down all requests for shows, including a support slot for R.E.M.  Before Neutral Milk Hotel began their indefinite hiatus, Mangum played live at a house show on December 5, 1998 in Athens on Chris Bilheimer's birthday. The bill was shared with Elf Power, and the audience was made up almost completely of friends and bandmates. Playing solo and acoustic, Mangum opened the set with what was to be the only post-Aeroplane composition to be performed in public, \\"Little Birds,\\" a song about a boy whose body becomes filled with miniature birds that protect him from his murderous father. Mangum finished the rest of the evening with most of the Aeroplane songs, encouraging the audience to sing along in substitute for the horn parts. For the last several songs, Scott Spillane took his trumpet into an adjacent room and played his parts through the wall. A recording of the show circulated on the internet, but it has never been officially released, most likely due to the poor quality of the recording.  Mangum played another show on December 31, 1998, at which he performed the songs \\"Oh Sister,\\" \\"Engine,\\" and \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,\\" joined by Koster and Spillane.  In the Aeroplane Over the Sea has been cited by several as one of the greatest albums of all time. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Is there anything else important to know about this time?","output":"Neutral Milk Hotel was a special band that made unique music with interesting sounds and instruments.

If everyone has a car and drives anywhere they want to go, there will be serious traffic problems on the road. Luckily, trains are a good form of public transport. British people use trains a lot. This is especially so for people who are travelling from London to Paris. Every day about 20 trains leave London. They travel at a very high speed and people feel glad that the trains take only 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Paris. It's much faster to travel by train than by bus or by car. This is because people have to drive cars or buses very carefully and lowly for many reasons, such as speed limits and traffic jams. However, when you are travelling by train, the speed is almost the same and there is no traffic jam for a train. Besides, Londoners think taking a train is one of the safest ways of travelling on the ground. Trains take quite a number of quality tests while they are made. More importantly, they have to take many safety checks before they are used on the rail track. What's more, trains in Britain are comfortable and provide fine services for their users. When you are on a London train, you will find that the train has comfortable tables and seats where people can sit. They also provide food services and power plugs  for personal computers or mobile phone. Question: In a traffic jams on the road,   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"cars are not moving fast\\"?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? See options at the end James put the egg in the refrigerator and the meat in the sun. Now the  Available choices: a). egg is hot.; b). meat is hot.;","output":"b). meat is hot. James, after putting the egg in the refrigerator and the meat in the sun, noticed that the meat is hot. This outcome can be expected because of several factors. 1. Sun Exposure: The primary reason for the meat becoming hot is its exposure to sunlight. Sunlight contains energy in the form of solar radiation, which is composed of various wavelengths such as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light. When an object, in this case, the meat, is exposed to sunlight, it absorbs the energy from these wavelengths, causing its temperature to rise. The longer the meat is exposed to direct sunlight, the hotter it will become. 2. Ambient Temperature: The ambient temperature of the surrounding environment also plays a role in the meat's temperature increment. If the day is hot, the air around the meat is already warm, and its effect on the meat's temperature will be more significant. Conversely, if the day is cold, the meat may not get as hot, even with direct sun exposure. 3. Heat Conduction: The meat's internal temperature will also rise because of heat conduction. As the surface area exposed to sunlight heats up, heat energy travels from the outer layer to the inner layer of the meat. This transfer of heat energy causes the entire piece of meat to become hot. 4. Type of Meat and Surface Color: Different types of meat may absorb sunlight differently, with darker-colored meats generally absorbing more sunlight than lighter-colored ones. Therefore, the type and color of the meat placed in the sun can also influence how hot it gets. While the egg's location in the refrigerator keeps it cool by lowering its temperature to match the refrigerator's set temperature, the opposite happens to the meat. As the meat is exposed to sun and the factors mentioned above, its temperature increases. Therefore, the correct choice is \\"b). meat is hot.\\" because the environmental conditions and the meat's properties lead to this outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Take the soot-stained fabric outdoors and gently shake off any excess soot. Be careful not to shake too vigorously so that you don’t make the stain bigger or spread the soot around any more than is necessary. If you shake the fabric too vigorously, you also risk grinding the soot into the fabric – ultimately making it harder to clean. For fabrics stained with soot, try rinsing them with cold water to remove the stain. Turn the fabric inside out and run it under cool water to get as much of the soot out as possible. Try not to spread the stain further or grind the soot into the fabric with your hands. Try to let the cold water do its job and avoid touching the soot during the process. If you have soot stains on fabric materials like clothing, you can try soaking them overnight in laundry detergent. Fill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of laundry detergent and submerge the items. Let the fabric soak for at least six hours. If the soot-stained items can be bleached without being ruined, add a few drops of bleach to the detergent/water mixture. Use the hottest possible setting on your laundry machine to wash the soot-stained fabric. Use bleach (or color safe bleach, if the fabric requires it) when you run the washing machine.  Make sure that you have done all you can to minimize the soot stain before you actually wash the fabric. Using several methods together will be much more effective at removing the stain than just attempting one method. Don’t put the fabric in the dryer until you have checked to make sure the soot stain was completely removed. Otherwise, this could permanently set the stain in the fabric.

Step 1: Setting the context and understanding the situation The story tells us that doves are taking a precautionary measure by flying away from the tree and into the bush. It indicates that there must be a potential threat near the tree which is causing the birds to change their location. Step 2: Expanding the storyline by focusing on the potential threat The tree had become dangerous due to the presence of a large, menacing snake that had been spotted slithering on its branches earlier that day. The snake was well-known among the forest creatures as a fierce predator and a danger to the birds. Step 3: Describing the birds' actions in response to the threat As the doves sought refuge in the nearby bush, they tried to blend in with the leaves, hoping to remain undetected by the snake. The bush was dense and provided good cover for the doves, making it an ideal spot for them to gather and protect themselves. Step 4: Introducing other characters in the story In the meantime, a crafty fox was lurking nearby, carefully observing the commotion caused by the doves' sudden flight. The fox had a sly plan in mind. He decided to use the snake's presence to his advantage and catch a dove for his dinner. Step 5: Building a twist in the story The fox approached the bush and called out to the doves, pretending to be a concerned friend. \\"Dear doves, I have come to warn you about a venomous snake in the area. It is extremely dangerous and poses a threat to all the birds. I have a hiding place far from here where you will be safe.\\" Step 6: Leading the story towards a climax The doves, panicked and frightened, contemplated the fox's offer. Little did they know that the fox had sinister intentions. Right before they could make a decision, a wise old owl who had been residing in the tree above the bush since the beginning heard everything and decided to intervene.

While speeding down a dirt road, they hit and kill a grizzly bear cub, sending their Jeep Cherokee into a tree and cracking the radiator. As they argue over whether they should bury the dead cub, they hear its mother coming and run. The vehicle overheats down the road so Wes and Ritch go into the forest to find water. The Grizzly Bear finds and attacks Ritch. Having heard Ritch's screams to run, Wes inadvertently runs into the bear and it attacks him. The other two arrive and rescue Wes, but are unable to help Ritch. The Bear kills him while the others flee to the Jeep. The vehicle starts again and they leave, but Wes panics and tries to force Sean to turn around and go back for Ritch, causing the car to go over a cliff.

Paragraph: Duane was hungry, but he hurried through the ample supper that was set before him, urged on by curiosity and astonishment. The only way he could account for his presence there in a ranger's camp was that MacNelly hoped to get useful information out of him. Still that would hardly have made this captain so eager. There was a mystery here, and Duane could scarcely wait for it to be solved. While eating he had bent keen eyes around him. After a first quiet scrutiny the rangers apparently paid no more attention to him. They were all veterans in service--Duane saw that--and rugged, powerful men of iron constitution. Despite the occasional joke and sally of the more youthful members, and a general conversation of camp-fire nature, Duane was not deceived about the fact that his advent had been an unusual and striking one, which had caused an undercurrent of conjecture and even consternation among them. These rangers were too well trained to appear openly curious about their captain's guest. If they had not deliberately attempted to be oblivious of his presence Duane would have concluded they thought him an ordinary visitor, somehow of use to MacNelly. As it was, Duane felt a suspense that must have been due to a hint of his identity.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager  beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest  . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever. Now, I extremely treasure the moment when my father says those three words to me. I've learned to appreciate every relationship I have, to tell people I care about them, and to never take anything in life for granted. Question: According to this passage, we know that   _  .

Henry V is debating whether he has the right to claim french territories under a property contract, presumably advocated by the clergy, between France and England at some prior date (citation needed).Prologue: Bear with us as we attempt to retell the story of Henry V at Agincourt, though our stage is an unworthy scaffold (a shallow representation) of the events which transpired before, during, and after.As the play unfolds, we see the clergy in a meeting about the king's seeming indifference of its claim --on technicality--to the french kingdom. There is a gathering of the king's subjects to hear details from the clergy as to why England has the right to claim the lands of the French. According to the clergy, by contract from previous encounters, the french must have a male heir, but at present have a female one, which effectually nullifies French royalty's claim to the french kingdom.The king warns the clergy to state the facts -- any other entreaty would lead to \\"much fall of blood,\\" which is expected due to the two contending kingdom's property. To be certain he is within his rights to claim french territories, he orders the clergyman to be blunt...does England have the right to make a claim of France?The clergyman says yes, and that if it is a sin, let it be on his head.Furthermore, the clergyman states that the winning back of such land would bring vast sums of money to the clergy. and King of England.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person whose work's increased value has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries?  Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.

Having children has its own unique set of joys and challenges that came with parenthood. And Samuel was about to experience yet another challenge: finding a reliable babysitter for his three rambunctious children on short notice. His regular babysitter had fallen ill, and with a significant business event to attend tonight, he couldn't afford to be late or absent. Samuel called up his best friend, Hunter, wondering if he had any recommendations. Although Hunter did not have children of his own, he happened to have a neighbor who was an experienced babysitter. He had heard good things about her abilities to manage and entertain children, and suggested that Samuel give her a try. Feeling somewhat wary, but with no other options, Samuel contacted the neighbor, who agreed to babysit his children. Elaine, the babysitter, arrived early, giving him time to discuss the usual routine, house rules, and emergency contacts. With a sense of relief, Samuel noticed her gentle demeanor, professionalism, and apparent competency in addressing his concerns. As Samuel prepared to leave for his event, he couldn't shake the feeling of uneasiness, that nagging voice in his head reminding him that he had never left his children with a stranger before. In an effort to reassure himself, he called Hunter and asked if he would be willing to pop over to his house later to check on Elaine and the kids, since they were already good neighbors. Grateful, Samuel headed off to his event, reminding himself that his children were resilient, and every new experience was an opportunity for growth. Meanwhile, at home, Elaine was quickly winning over the young ones with her genuine warmth, infectious laughter, and knack for storytelling. She discovered each child's unique interests and talents, engaging them in games, puzzles, and arts and crafts. True to his word, Hunter came by to visit them, and what he saw elated him. He found the children happily absorbed in their activities, laughing and enjoying their time with Elaine. They seemed to have formed an instant bond, much to his relief. When Samuel returned home that night, exhausted but satisfied with the outcome of his business event, he was pleasantly surprised to find his home in order, his children tucked into bed and fast asleep. Elaine presented him with a detailed report of their evening, complete with hand-drawn cards from the children, thanking Samuel for providing such an entertaining babysitter.

Not only did he find a solution to his immediate need, but he also discovered the value of trusting others and cultivating his own network of support, knowing that, sometimes, life would throw curveballs that he couldn't handle alone. This experience reminded Samuel of the importance of friendship, trust, and community in navigating the rollercoaster that is parenthood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lita Morgan, who was adopted when she was two-years-old, has now spoken out after her mother was convicted of cruelty against her. A woman subjected to a decade of abuse at the hands of her cruel adoptive mother has spoken of her ordeal for the first time. Christine Morgan forced her adoptive daughter to drink bleach from a cloth used to clean toilets during her ten-year reign of terror. The violence also included holding the child’s head under the bath water until she couldn’t breathe and threatening to kill her. Lita Morgan, who was adopted when she was two-years-old, has now spoken out after her mother was convicted of cruelty against her. Miss Morgan, 27, reported the crimes to police after suffering post-traumatic stress, caused by the abuse, as an adult. She said: 'I never want a child to suffer in the way I did. Nobody capable of such violence should be able to adopt a defenceless child. 'I feel let down and angry that I was left to suffer at her hands for so long. Social services could have saved me but they missed the signs and believed every word she said. 'I doubt I will ever get over what happened to me but I hope speaking out might save another child from the same hell I went through.' Miss Morgan was adopted at the age of two, but the abuse started when she was four-years-old. She said: 'For as long as I could remember mum had treated me differently to my brother who was also adopted. 'I was kept locked in my room and dressed in dirty clothes. If I asked for something to eat she would slap me in the face. 'I was bullied and teased at school for being smelly but she didn’t care.' Miss Morgan, 27, reported the crimes to police after suffering post-traumatic stress, caused by the abuse, as an adult. She is pictured here as a baby with her adoptive mother Christine Morgan. Miss Morgan once asked her mother why she treated her so badly. 'She told me she had wanted to adopt twin baby boys but they had gone to another mother and she got left with me instead. 'I wondered why she had gone ahead with the adoption if she didn’t want me. I dreamed of her taking me back to a children's home so another family could have me. 'I didn’t understand what I had done so wrong for her to despise me as she did.' As she grew older Miss Morgan said the beatings got worse and her adoptive mother often left her covered in bruises. 'She would grab me around the throat and tell me to die. Miss Morgan was adopted at the age of two, but the abuse started when she was four-years-old. 'It wasn’t unusual for her to smack me until my skin was bright red and pull my hair out in clumps.' One day Morgan held her adopted daughter's head under the bath water, leaving the young girl fearing she would die. 'I really thought that was it. I came up gasping for air lucky to alive.' Another time her mother forced a bleach soaked rag used to clean toilets into her mouth. 'I. had been playing on the stairs and she just got angry and grabbed me. and dragged me into the bathroom where she had been cleaning. 'I never want a child to suffer in the way I did. Nobody capable of such violence should be able to adopt a defenceless child' - Lita Morgan. 'She had the dirty rag in her hand, got me in a hold and rammed it into my mouth. 'It was burning like acid and I was gagging. Eventually I managed to escape from her grip to run to my room and throw up.' Miss Morgan claims there were several missed opportunities to rescue her from the abuse. She said: 'One day two women turned up from social services. The school must have told them about my bruising. But mum was a good actress and told them I was just clumsy so they went away again. 'I remember breaking down because I knew then I was never going to be saved.' She said Morgan’s husband also colluded with her to keep the abuse hidden by backing up her lies. Miss Morgan said: 'I was upset but I never blamed him. I could see he was afraid of her too and I honestly think he didn’t know how bad it was because most of it happened when he was at work. Christine Morgan (pictured) was convicted on two cruelty charges at Southampton Crown Court last year. 'He was also scared of losing me because he knew social services would take me away if they knew about the abuse.' It was only after he passed away when she was 17 that Miss Morgan found the strength to leave. 'Without dad the abuse got even worse. I couldn’t take anymore. I confided in a friend who let me stay with her.' Eventually she found a job and a flat and worked all hours to block out the memories of her childhood. But, she said, no matter how hard she tried, she could not forget. She said: 'I suffered flashbacks and nightmares. I would dream I was six years old again with my head under the water gasping for breath.' Her GP referred her for counselling, but Miss Morgan says talking about the abuse made the flashbacks even worse. One day she suffered a breakdown and found herself at her local police station asking for help. She said: 'For the first time someone listened. I made a statement and mum was arrested.' Christine Morgan, 61, appeared at Southampton Crown Court last year. She denied the charges and Miss Morgan gave evidence from behind a screen. During the hearing Elizabeth Bussey-Jones, prosecuting, said: 'She describes from a very early age being subjected to various forms of verbal abuse, being told by Christine Morgan that she hated her, that she was a waste of space and that she wanted to kill her. 'She recalls various acts of violence towards her which vary from being pinned up by the throat against a wall, being smacked and having her hair pulled.' The jury found her mother guilty and she was convicted on two cruelty charges. Morgan was warned to expect jail but because of her failing health Judge Gary Burrell handed her a 12 month suspended prison sentence and ordered her to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. She was also told to pay £1,500 in costs. Miss Morgan has now said: 'I was devastated by the sentence. It didn’t seem fair for what she put me through. But it helped me accept that there was nothing wrong with me and I did not deserve the abuse. 'I was a child who needed a loving home and instead I got placed with that lunatic. 'She didn’t know the first thing about being a mother and should never have been allowed anywhere near a child. 'I am sharing my story because I don't want anything like this to happen to another vulnerable child.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article by Kelly Strange tells the heartbreaking story of Lita Morgan, who was adopted at two years old and suffered a decade of abuse by her adoptive mother, Christine Morgan.

Lita reported the abuse to police at the age of 27, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She expressed her believe that no one capable of such violence should be allowed to adopt a defenseless child.

The contrast of flavors between the earthy beetroot, creamy goat cheese, and tangy aged balsamic reduction was incredible, leaving me eagerly anticipating my main course. For the entree, I selected the mushroom risotto, and I can honestly say it was the best version of this dish I have ever tasted. The Arborio rice was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of al dente, while the wild mushrooms added a depth of flavor that was both rich and complex. The chef's choice to top the dish with a sprinkle of truffle oil only served to elevate the dish to another level.  Let's not forget about the drinks! Their extensive wine list boasted an impressive selection of international and regional options, with the knowledgeable sommelier gladly offering pairing suggestions. Following her advice, I opted for a glass of full-bodied red wine that exquisitely complemented the flavors of my meal.  To finish the night, I indulged in the decadent dark chocolate souffle served with a side of velvety raspberry coulis. The souffle was light yet rich, with the raspberries adding a tart contrast that was nothing short of divine.

Creating a privacy screen in a shared room can be achieved by hanging up a bed sheet in the middle of the room. This is because bed sheets are large enough to cover a significant area, and they are also opaque, making it difficult for people on either side of the sheet to see each other. Option (2) - hanging up tissue paper in the middle of the room - is not an effective solution for creating a privacy screen. Tissue paper is typically thin, and it can be easily torn or damaged.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Maggie Fox, NBC News      The new MERS virus, which has infected 64 people and killed 38 of them, is mostly spread in hospitals and it will take special care to prevent bigger outbreaks, experts reported on Wednesday.      An investigation into the outbreak in Saudi Arabia showed 21 people were infected as patients who unknowingly went from one clinic to another, spreading the virus. It can spread quickly in the hospital if strict precautions are not taken – including isolating patients, putting masks on both the patients and the health care workers and strict hand hygiene, the researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.      “We saw transmission (between) health care facilities because people would go from one to another and it would not be recognized,” said Dr. Trish Perl of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.      The problem is there’s not a great test yet for the virus so it’s not always easy to tell who has it, Perl and colleagues reported.      The new virus is called MERS, for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. It is a distant cousin of SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus that infected 8,000 people globally, killing nearly 800 of them before it was stopped in 2003.      Coronaviruses are a big family and they usually cause common cold-like symptoms in people. But in some cases they can cause very severe infections – and MERS is one of these.      Scientists are keeping a very close eye on MERS. “We cannot afford to have another SARS,” Perl told NBC News. It’s already been reported in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy – carried by travelers. And some of those sick have infected other people in the other countries – notably a French patient who infected a roommate in the hospital.      Perl and colleagues visited a hospital in Al-Hasa in eastern Saudi Arabia, where one outbreak sickened 23 people in April and May. Out of 217 people living in the same homes as the patients, five became infected, while two hospital workers did.      “A total of 21 of the 23 cases were acquired by person to person transmission in hemodialysis units, intensive care units or in-patient units in three different health care facilities,” Perl’s team wrote.      Perl and colleagues – including Dr. Allison McGeer of the University of Toronto, who was herself infected by SARS in 2003 -- needed to find out how the virus spread. Because tests for MERS are not very accurate, patients had to be tested over and over before there was a positive test, Perl’s team reported.      Once it was clear the virus was spreading, however, hospital officials tightened up their routine and the spread stopped.      “They had aggressive hand hygiene, which is key,” Perl said. “We know that proper hand hygiene reduces respiratory viruses by 30 percent.” They also started better use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, she said. “These are not particularly difficult viruses to kill,” she said.      Patients with respiratory symptoms were isolated or kept together and away from other patients. Those getting dialysis wore masks and were spread out a bit more than usual from one another. “These are basic tenets for what we would do for influenza or SARS,” Perl said. “People might consider them onerous but they are common-sense things.”      MERS has not been seen in the United States, although a handful of travelers have been tested for the virus. Perl said the facilities in Saudi Arabia weren’t much different from similarly rural clinics in the United States. “The place is clean,” she said. “The technology that was available there was similar to what we might find here.”      The researchers were not able to determine if MERS spreads before people start showing symptoms. They also couldn’t say if the virus was spread in the air, or in droplets that might be spread between people who are very close to one another or by touching surfaces.      \\"Our investigation showed some surprising similarities between MERS and SARS. Both are very deadly viruses and easily transferred between people, and even between health care facilities,\\" Perl said.      As with SARS, some people seem to spread the virus more easily than others, she added.      Now it is too soon to say if MERS is going to spread as widely as SARS did, Perl says. SARS spread slowly within China for weeks or months before travelers carried it globally. In one notorious instance, an infected traveler became sick and threw up in a Hong Kong hotel. He infected seven other people, who eventually carried the virus to Canada, Vietnam, Singapore and elsewhere in Hong Kong.      It could happen again, Perl says. “We have to be careful because we don’t totally know what to expect,” she said. “The one thing I have learned in this business is that respiratory viruses are very difficult to predict.”      The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say anyone returning from the Middle East with severe acute respiratory infections should be isolated and tested for MERS. Health care workers who care for them need to use special precautions, including gowns and face masks.             ||||| A new virus responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness in the Middle East may be more deadly than SARS, according to a team of infectious disease specialists who recently investigated a set of cases in Saudi Arabia.      Of 23 confirmed cases in April, 15 people died — an “extremely high” fatality rate of 65 percent, according to Johns Hopkins senior epidemiologist Trish Perl, a member of the team that analyzed the spread of the virus through four Saudi hospitals.      Saudi officials said that as of Wednesday, 49 people have contracted the disease and 32 have died.      The infectious disease experts, who published their findings online Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, reported that infection occurred by way of person-to-person contact and poses an especially serious risk because it is easily transmitted in hospital settings.      Worldwide, the overall death rate from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus — or MERS-CoV — is at 59 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate is expected to bounce around as new clusters of infection develop.      View Graphic MERS: Mild for some, deadly for others      The vast majority of MERS-CoV infections have been in Saudi Arabia. No cases have been reported in the United States, but small clusters of infections have appeared in Britain, France, Italy and Tunisia.      Since the virus first emerged in April 2012 with two fatal cases in Jordan, 64 people have been infected and 38 have died around the world. The virus comes from the same family as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2003.      Both viruses have a distinct      haloed appearance when viewed under a microscope, and they typically target the respiratory tract. Like SARS, MERS starts with a fever and mild cough that eventually progress to pneumonia.      At first, MERS does not look out of the ordinary compared with other, less serious types of respiratory infection. But Perl said doctors should start taking careful note of a patient’s travel history, since all reported cases have been linked to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.      The team of specialists mapped the likely trail of infection that spanned four Saudi hospitals in just over a month. Patients stationed in the same hospital room or ward as an infected person, or even taken care of by the same nurse, were likely to be exposed to the virus. Out of the 23 infected, hospital patients made up the majority of cases, but the virus also spread to visiting family members and hospital staff.      The incubation period of the virus — the time between exposure and development of symptoms — was similar to SARS, about five days. During this period, the researchers warned, infection may be possible.      While the high mortality rate is alarming, Perl said that outbreaks tend to have death rates that are high at the beginning but then decline over time as doctors identify patients with milder versions of the illness. She cited the H1N1 and SARS outbreaks as examples.      This particular outbreak was largely contained by early detection and isolation of those infected, and through tighter hospital infection-control procedures — steps such as assigning a specific nurse to watch for patients with symptoms, requiring health-care workers to put on face masks and gloves, and fitting masks on patients. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The new MERS virus has infected 64 people and killed 38 of them.

She could have written just ordinary routine notes of acknowledgement. But that was not her way. She sat down and wrote the woman in Toronto a real letter telling all about the village, and the names of the children who were wearing the knitted gloves and caps, and what they said when they got them, and how they looked when they wore them. She wanted the woman who had knitted and sent all those lovely knittings \\"to see how much happiness and warmth she had created.\\" Not long after, she received the following answer from Canada.

There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it.

After the defeat of several Song armies in the north, Emperor Qinzong wanted to negotiate a truce with the Jin, but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng. Neglecting the importance of the capital, he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100,000 soldiers. The Song forces were dispersed throughout China, powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city. The Jin assault commenced in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong continued to sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later. Qinzong, the former emperor Huizong, and members of the Song court were captured by the Jurchens as hostages. They were taken north to Huining , where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners. The former emperors were humiliated by their captors. They were mocked with disparaging titles like \\"Muddled Virtue\\" and \\"Double Muddled\\". In 1128 the Jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals. The harsh treatment of the Song royalty softened after the death of Huizong in 1135. Titles were granted to the deceased monarch, and his son Qinzong was promoted to Duke, a position with a salary.

Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent. Nick Clegg has been accused of 'unbelievable hypocrisy' over a spare room subsidy U-turn. Nick Clegg was accused of ‘unbelievable hypocrisy’ last night after withdrawing support for one of the Government’s flagship welfare policies. The Liberal Democrats demanded significant changes to the spare room subsidy, under which tenants with more bedrooms than they need see their housing benefit reduced. The change of heart is being seen as a Lib Dem tactic to woo Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 election – and a desperate attempt to overturn months of appalling poll ratings. But Labour condemned the move, pointing out that the Tories were only able to introduce the subsidy, dubbed the ‘bedroom tax’ by critics, thanks to Lib Dem votes in the Commons. Tories said they were baffled by the change of heart, saying the Lib Dems had never argued against the measure in private. And it emerged last night that the Lib Dems had been given the chance in March to soften the impact of the ‘bedroom tax’. BBC’s Newsnight programme reported that options were drawn up by civil servants and presented to both coalition parties that would have allowed councils to cushion the impact of benefit cuts under the policy to help people struggling. But the Lib Dems apparently ignored the suggestion. Under the controversial reform, introduced in April 2013, social housing tenants deemed to  have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced, to tackle what the Government calls a ‘spare room subsidy’. But a government review published this week showed that almost 60 per cent of households affected by the benefit changes were in arrears as a result. And a shortage of smaller homes meant just 4.5 per cent of tenants had been able to downsize to avoid it. Unveiling the U-turn yesterday, Lib Dem Cabinet minister Danny Alexander did not call for the bedroom tax to be scrapped – but said it should be reformed so that no one faces a benefit cut if there is no suitable smaller property available. In addition, he said all disabled claimants should be exempt. Scroll down for video. The Lib Dem change of heart is being seen as a tactic to woo Ed Miliband, pictured, in the run-up to the 2015 election. Mr Clegg has been under pressure to join Labour in opposing the policy since the Lib Dem conference voted overwhelmingly to commit the party to the review of what activists called a ‘reprehensible and evil’ move. Mr Alexander said the issue would be raised with the Tories ahead of George Osborne’s Autumn Statement but if the Lib Dems are not able to secure agreement within government it will be ‘one of the key things in our election manifesto’. Rejecting the accusation of hypocrisy, he said: ‘We are part of the Government and the principle is the right one, which is that people should be paid housing benefit according to the number of rooms that they need. Then and now: Deputy PM Nick Clegg's change of heart over the spare bedroom subsidy. ‘This is about how that policy is applied in practice. It’s about listening to the evidence and significantly adjusting the policy in the light of that evidence.’ Labour’s welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves said: ‘This is unbelievable hypocrisy from Nick Clegg. There wouldn’t be a bedroom tax if it wasn’t for the Lib Dems.’ Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said the Lib Dem shift had not been discussed with the  Premier or the Chancellor. But Mr Clegg told LBC Radio it was ‘baloney’ for the Tories to claim they were surprised. ‘I’ve been constantly badgering away within government, with the Department for Work and Pensions, to try to make sure we really stress-test this properly.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Nick Clegg withdraws support for the government's spare room subsidy policy. 2. Liberal Democrats demand changes to the policy, which reduces housing benefits for tenants with more bedrooms than needed. 3. The change in stance is seen as a tactic to gain favor with Ed Miliband ahead of the 2015 election and potentially improve standings in polls. 4. Labour criticizes the move, and points out that the policy was initially introduced thanks to Lib Dem votes in Commons. Tories claim they are baffled by the change of heart. 5. The Lib Dems had been given the chance to soften the policy's impact in March but appeared to ignore the suggestion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There would be much to investigate. A few senior officials in the West Wing had access to details of the allegations of physical and emotional abuse made by  Mr. Porterâs  ex-wives. A greater number of people had a sense that something was amiss  but chose to avert their gaze instead of asking questions. The first hours after the issue was brought to light by an article in The Daily Mail were a confused blur  with officials like Mr. Kelly at first endorsing  Mr. Porter âs resignation  but then agreeing to issue statements in support of  him . That disarray belied the belief of some in the White House that someone â Mr. Kelly â was finally in charge after six months of drama and infighting in 2017. In reality  these officials now concede  no one truly was. âThey havenât figured out how the place operates  and apparently they donât want to learn â said John Dean  a White House counsel under President Richard M. Nixon. The  Porter  situation  he added  âis a manifestation of what happens when you have chaos.â Mr. Kelly  a four-star Marine general  had been billed as uniquely qualified to bring order to Mr. Trumpâs world when he took his post in July. Now he faces a morale crisis in the West Wing  where aides describe a sense of betrayal by a chief of staff they no longer trust after his claims that he had not fully known about  Mr. Porter âs problems and had acted within minutes once  he  learned of them. But in the case of  Mr. Porter   White House aides privately acknowledge  some advisers appear to have chosen to try to protect a colleague who was generally well liked and  more important  too competent to lose. Mr. Trump himself often expressed his regard for  Mr. Porter  by describing him as âout of central casting.â In the hours after the allegations against  Mr. Porter  became public  some senior officials in fact hesitated to force  him  out  in part because they argued that if one top adviser could be felled by accusations  they could all potentially be vulnerable.  Mr. Porter  denied privately to  his  colleagues  as well as publicly  that  he  had ever physically abused  his  wives. What distinguished this crisis from the ones that preceded it was that it was not localized to one official  such as Stephen K. Bannon  the isolated chief strategist who left in August  or Reince Priebus  the often uninformed chief of staff who departed a month before that.  Mr. Porterâs case  had spread to so many aspects of the White House that  it  ensnared a number of staff members. While multiple officials in the West Wing were aware that he had been unable to pass his background check  none appear to have made an effort to ascertain precisely why and take action on it. Several former White House counsels have said they would have made it their business to know if an official at Mr. Porterâs level was facing allegations as serious as domestic abuse  but officials in the White House have privately maintained that Donald F. McGahn II  the White House counsel  never did.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts. New technology like satellite pictures and temperature measuring equipment can help. Still, it is very hard to say when or where El Nino will cause damage. Question: It happens   _  .

Information:  - Herbaceous plants (in botanical use frequently simply herbs) are plants that have no persistent woody stem above ground. Herbaceous plants may be annuals, biennials or perennials.  - Patagonia is a sparsely populated region located at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. The region comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains as well as the deserts, steppes and grasslands east of this southern portion of the Andes. Patagonia has two coasts; a western one towards the Pacific Ocean and an eastern one towards the Atlantic Ocean.  - Halophytum ameghinoi is a species of herbaceous plant endemic to Patagonia . It is a succulent annual plant , with simple , fleshy , alternate leaves . The plants are monoecious , with solitary female flowers and inflorescences of male flowers on the same plant . Halophytum has sometimes been placed in its own family , Halophytaceae . For instance , the 2009 APG III system and the 2003 APG II system recognise the family and assign it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots , although the 1998 APG system did not recognise such a family , placing its members in the family Chenopodiaceae instead .  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - In botany, blossoms are the flowers of stone fruit trees (genus \\"Prunus\\") and of some other plants with a similar appearance that flower profusely for a period of time in spring.

Scott Spradley Named CIO of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Scott Spradley has been named the chief information officer for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, according to a memo obtained by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Spradley, a seven-year veteran at H-P, most recently led efforts separating the company’s IT systems as it split into two entities. Mr. Spradley will replace Ramon Baez, who was appointed senior vice president of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise’s customer advocacy organization in February, and had served in the role of CIO until now. In this customer-focused role, Mr. Baez will be speaking at conferences and consulting with CIOs on their own IT transformations, CIO Journal reported in August. At the beginning of August, H-P began operating as two separate entities as the company waits for final approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The split creates two companies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will sell corporate technology and services, and HP Inc., which will sell PCs and printers. The separation of the two companies is expected to be complete on November 1. Naresh Shanker is CIO for HP Inc. Mr. Spradley was the IT leader responsible for separating the IT components of the two companies. He managed a team that worked directly with more than 3,500 customers and partners to prepare to separate nearly 750 systems, or 95% of H-P’s business. It also meant cloning 2,600 internal computer programs including human resources systems and supply chain forms, separating their data and restarting them, reported WSJ’s Robert McMillan. The memo noted Mr. Spradley’s 25 years of leadership and IT experience. He has been with H-P for seven years, most recently serving as CIO of HP Global Functions. Previously, he held leadership roles at Intel Corp. and Chevron Corp. Robert McMillan contributed to this post.

BUT if you need non warranty service, like drop the camera or get it wet, your in deep do-do. I spilled something on the front of the camera, barely got it wet. United Camera and Binocular Repair, Kodak's nonwarranty repair center, wanted 193 to repair it.. Of coarse I'm not going to pay that much since the camera didnt cost much more than that anyway. I'm using an HP now and even though I dont like it as much as I did the Kodak, I'll never buy a camera from Kodak again. Answer:","output":"To determine the user's satisfaction level, I will consider the tone, positives and negatives mentioned in the review. Step 1: Identify the tone of the review The tone of the review seems to be somewhat mixed, with the user mentioning positive aspects like the camera being easy to use and taking great pictures, but also criticizing the non-warranty service cost.

Naturally occurring variations within a species are mainly the result of mutations and OPTIONS: (A). sexual reproduction. (B). dynamic equilibrium. (C). metabolism. (D). camouflage.The answer is:","output":"In order to determine the correct answer to the given question, let's analyze each option step by step and justify whether it is the main cause of naturally occurring variations within a species or not. (A) Sexual reproduction: Sexual reproduction involves the recombination of genetic material from two parents, resulting in offspring with a unique combination of genes. This process increases genetic diversity and is a major source of variation within a species. This option seems likely. (B) Dynamic equilibrium: Dynamic equilibrium refers to a state in which opposing forces or processes maintain a balance, such as population size or chemical reactions. It does not directly contribute to genetic diversity or variation within a species. (C) Metabolism: Metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions that occur within an organism to maintain life. Although metabolism is essential for life, it does not directly contribute to genetic variation within a species. (D) Camouflage: Camouflage is a way for organisms to blend in with their surroundings as an adaptation for survival. While it is a result of genetic variation, it does not directly cause the genetic variation itself. Looking at our analysis of each option, the main source of naturally occurring variations within a species is (A) sexual reproduction.

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

The captured soldier liked the cage better than the cell, because the","output":"cage provided him with a sense of connection to the outside world, maintaining a level of mental and emotional stability that exceeded what he could achieve in the isolated confines of the cell.  Firstly, the cage allowed natural light to filter in and illuminate his space, which had a significant impact on his overall well-being. Exposure to sunlight is essential, as humans have an intrinsic need for it; sunlight helps regulate sleep patterns, produce vital nutrients such as vitamin D, and boost mood. The cell, by contrast, only had artificial lighting, which could not provide the same health benefits. Ultimately, the cage's exposure to daylight helped the captured soldier maintain a sense of normalcy and kept his spirits up. Secondly, the design of the cage, with its bars, offered a view of the surrounding environment that the confinement of a solid-walled cell could not. The ability to observe the world outside of his imprisonment was comforting to the soldier, who could at least watch the changes in weather, notice the natural beauty of his surroundings, and observe any other living creatures that happened to pass by. This served as a reminder that there was still a world outside of his captivity, providing hope that he could one day return to it. The solace derived from these observations helped the soldier to feel less isolated in his plight. Moreover, the openness of the cage granted the captured soldier an opportunity to communicate with other prisoners who might be held nearby. Engaging in social interactions is a basic human need and one that can promote mental resilience in the face of adversity. In contrast, the walls of the cell might muffle or completely stifle any potential verbal exchanges with fellow detainees, leaving the soldier feeling utterly alone. Additionally, the cage provided better ventilation, allowing fresh air to circulate more efficiently than it would in a cell. Access to clean air is vital for maintaining respiratory health and can contribute to an overall sense of cleanliness, even when living conditions might be otherwise far from ideal. The cell, on the other hand, would collect stale air, dampness, and potential odors from bodily functions, making it a significantly less habitable and more distressing environment. Lastly, the cage's structure enabled the soldier to maintain a heightened level of awareness in his surroundings. This offered a certain level of psychological comfort, as the soldier was able to better anticipate any threats or dangers entering his confined space. In contrast, the cell's walls blocked such awareness, leaving the soldier vulnerable to surprises and the fear that can come with a lack of control over one's environment. In conclusion, the captured soldier favored the cage over the cell due to the various physical and psychological benefits it provided. The access to sunlight, views of the outdoors, opportunities for communication with others, better ventilation, and increased situational awareness all contributed to a more tolerable living situation despite the inherent challenges of confinement. In the face of adversity and uncertainty, these factors undeniably played a vital role in preserving the soldier's mental and emotional stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a telephone conversation with another trader, he described the QE operation as ‘cake’, meaning an easy way to make profit. ‘We’ve been loading up with QE trades for months…..QE’s are cake,’ he said. The profits would have accrued to his employer, OPTIONS: - Bank, but would have helped boost his bonus. - Bank of England, but would have helped boost his bonus. - British, but would have helped boost his bonus. - City, but would have helped boost his bonus. - City bank Credit Suisse, but would have helped boost his bonus. - Credit Suisse, but would have helped boost his bonus. - FCA, but would have helped boost his bonus. - Financial Conduct Authority, but would have helped boost his bonus. - Mark Stevenson, but would have helped boost his bonus. - QE, but would have helped boost his bonus. - Quantitative Easing, but would have helped boost his bonus. - Rogue, but would have helped boost his bonus. - Ruth Sunderland, but would have helped boost his bonus.","output":"- City bank Credit Suisse, but would have helped boost his bonus. In this passage, Mark Stevenson, a former dealer at City bank Credit Suisse, was trying to exploit the Bank of England's Quantitative Easing program for his own personal gain. So, the profits would have gone to his employer, which is City bank Credit Suisse, but would have helped boost his bonus. The other options are incorrect because they either refer to the wrong entity (such as Bank of England, British, City, FCA, and others) or don't make logical sense in the context of the passage (such as Ruth Sunderland, who is the author of the passage)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements....  I am facing a new situation today: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would item B have higher or lower specific gravity than item A? A:","output":"Item B, which is a sample of surface rock, would have a lower specific gravity than item A, which represents the Earth. The specific gravity of the Earth as a whole is 5.515, while typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface ranges from 2.7 to 3.3. This difference implies that materials deeper within the Earth are denser than those found at the surface, as the overall specific gravity is greater than that of the surface rocks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which entity is this text about? Hrolfr Kraki, Hrodulf, Rolfo, Roluo, Rolf Krage (early 6th century) was a legendary Danish king who appears in both Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian tradition. His name would in his own language (Proto-Norse) have been *Hrothiwulfaz (famous wolf). Both traditions describe him as a Danish Scylding, the nephew of Hrodgar and the grandson of Healfdene. The consensus view is that Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian traditions describe the same people. The Chronicon Lethrense and the included Annales Lundenses tell that Haldan (Healfdene) had two sons, Helghe (Halga) and Ro (Hrodgar). When Haldan died of old age, Helghe and Ro divided the kingdom so that Ro ruled the land, and Helghe the sea. One day, Helghe arrived in Halland/Lolland and slept with Thore, the daughter of one of Ro's farmers. This resulted in a daughter named Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Rolf. Eventually, Helghe found out that Yrse was his own daughter and, out of shame, went east and killed himself.  Both Helghe and Ro being dead, a Swedish king, called Hakon in the Chronicon Lethrense proper, and Athisl in the Annales - corresponding to Eadgils - forced the Danes to accept a dog as king. The dog king was succeeded by Rolf Krage.  Rolf Krage was a big man in body and soul and was so generous that no one asked him for anything twice. His sister Skulda was married against Rolf's will to Hartwar or Hiarwarth (Heoroweard), a German earl of Skane, but reputedly Rolf had given Skulda to him together with Sweden.  This Hartwar arrived in Zealand with a large army and said that he wanted to give his tribute to Rolf, but killed Rolf together with all his men. Only one survived, Wigg, who played along until he was to do homage to Hartwar. Then, he pierced Hartwar with a sword, and so Hartwar was king for only one morning.

Create questions that result in factoid answers. A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. The plot revolves around Carlito (Carlos Sanz), who leads a wealthy and influential Mexican-American crime syndicate in Los Angeles. Worried about the encroachment of a group of heavily-armed members of the Chinese mafia, Carlito orders the contract killing of their leader, Don Kim (Keone Young). Carlito's best hitman, a British man called Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), is ordered to do the job. However Carlito underestimated the Chinese and after the hit, the anger of the Chinese is much greater than Carlito expected. Carlito regrets the hit, deeming it \\"ill-advised\\", and to ease the pressure Carlito offers the Chinese an explanation and a solution: the hit was nothing to do with him, and Carlito will remove certain elements within his own organization who were responsible and operating on their own.Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), a small time criminal and long-time rival of Chelios, uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios, unknown to Chelios who believes Carlito is still loyal to him. While Chelios sleeps in his apartment one night, Verona breaks in and injects Chelios with the \\"Beijing Cocktail\\". This is a synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of adrenaline from the adrenal glands, slowing the heart, and eventually killing the victim. Chelios wakes to find a recorded video explaining that Chelios should only have about an hour left before the poison stops his heart.Chelios phones Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam) who often works as a personal physician to the Mafia, who informs Chelios that in order to survive and keep his heart beating he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger, or get some artificial adrenaline, epinephrine. With his own adrenaline keeping the poison at bay at first, Chelios breaks into a hospital and steals numerous drugs, much more than Doc Miles advises him to take and also being \\"juiced\\" by hits from a defibrilator. He must keep his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts such as picking fights with other gangsters, stealing things, committing robberies, fighting with police and driving cars through shopping malls.The entire film takes place in a single day. Over the course of the day Chelios sets out to get his revenge on Verona, knowing that he probably will not make it to the end of the day, and attempting to find Verona and his street gang through Chelios' street contact Kaylo (Efren Ramirez), a flamboyant homosexual. Chelios also goes to pick up his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) before Verona's thugs get to her. Chelios has sex with Eve in the middle of a busy street in Chinatown while hundreds of people look on, in order to keep his adrenaline up.In the end it is revealed that Chelios spared Don Kim's life and told him to leave LA. Towards the end of the film, Chelios arranges a rooftop meeting with Carlito, Verona and their henchmen, who promise him a fake antidote. Don Kim arrives along with his Triads to assist Chelios, and in a shootout many of Carlito's men are killed. Carlito is killed by an ambitious and treacherous Verona, who then attempts to leave in Carlito's helicopter. The film concludes with Chelios confronting Verona in the helicopter and as they fight the pair fall from the chopper thousands of feet above LA, and mid-flight Chelios breaks Verona's neck. He then calls Eve on his cell phone, apologizing that he will not be coming back to her. Chelios hits a car, bounces off it and lands right in front of the camera.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. She has problem enough as it is. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"When evaluating the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"She has problem enough as it is,\\" one needs to consider factors such as grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. In essence, linguistic integrity refers to how well a sentence adheres to the established rules and principles of a particular language—in this case, English. 1. Grammar: Grammatical rules cover various aspects of language structure like word formation, part-of-speech agreements, and tense consistency. The sentence at hand contains a minor grammatical issue: it ought to have been \\"She has enough problems,\\" instead of \\"She has problem enough.\\" The correct version uses the plural form \\"problems\\" and places \\"enough\\" before the noun. 2. Syntax: Syntax refers to the organization and arrangement of phrases and clauses within a sentence. The syntax of the sentence in question is clear and comprehensible, despite its grammatical flaw. The subject \\"She\\" is followed by the verb \\"has,\\" which indicates that the sentence maintains a standard subject-verb-object structure. Nevertheless, the adverb \\"enough\\" is positioned awkwardly when it should be placed directly before the noun \\"problems.\\" 3. Semantics: Semantics concerns how meaning is extracted from words, phrases, and sentences. Though the sentence has both grammatical and syntactic imperfections, its meaning can still be inferred: the subject, described as a female, has a sufficient number of problems to deal with. As such, the sentence passes the semantics test. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics involves the broader context in which language is used and the social implications of speech. The phrase \\"as it is\\" enhances the sentence's pragmatic aspect by reinforcing the notion that the subject's existing circumstances are already problematic, making the sentence emotionally charged and indicating empathy or understanding towards the subject's situation. Taking all these factors into account, one could argue that the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"She has problem enough as it is\\" is not perfect. Although the sentence structure and overall context are clear, there is a minor grammatical issue which, if corrected, could enhance its clarity and accuracy. In its current form, the sentence might be deemed acceptable in casual or colloquial communication, but it would be less appropriate in formal or academic settings. To achieve better linguistic integrity, the sentence should be revised to: \\"She has enough problems as it is.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, the nail-biting competition at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans was not the only headline of the night. As the teams were battling it out on the field, nearly half of the stadium plunged into darkness during the third quarter.  Tensions ran high during the third quarter when an unexpected blackout affected approximately half of the Superdome's lights for a duration of 34 minutes. The sudden outage brought the game to a standstill and left millions of viewers eager to find out what transpired. The situation prompted an intriguing blend of confusion, bewilderment, and anticipation that would become etched into the memories of both the players and fans alike. While initial reports suggested that the city of New Orleans faced a ghostly predicament due to Super Bowl XLVII's blackout, Entergy, the local power company responsible for providing electricity to the city, later clarified the issue. An Entergy official informed the public that the unexpected mishap stemmed from the stadium itself, asserting that the \\"rest of New Orleans [was] fine.\\" With the power outage resolved after much deliberation and hard work by stadium technicians and electricians, play resumed following the 34-minute break. Despite having lost precious time and faced newfound challenges in the game's momentum, the San Francisco 49ers rallied and pushed for a comeback. However, their efforts ultimately fell short, with the Baltimore Ravens securing a 34-31 victory. The result marked their second Super Bowl championship, following their triumphant performance in the 2000 season. In the aftermath of this dramatic event, the NFL released a statement acknowledging the incident and expressing their intent to investigate the root cause. Their objective was to understand what led to the partial blackout at the iconic Superdome, which had previously hosted six Super Bowls and achieved a considerable amount of fame and recognition. The league sought to avoid any reoccurrence by identifying the problem, taking proactive measures, and implementing an improved security plan. As a testament to the resilience of professional athletes and the power of human determination, Super Bowl XLVII will forever be remembered as a game that showcased the unwavering spirit of both the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers' valiant fightback, coupled with the Ravens' spectacular display of steely resolve, strength, and strategy, turned the face-off into an instant classic. The thrilling match bore witness to the teams overcoming the hurdles of an unprecedented power outage, unrelenting competition, and unfathomable pressure. In conclusion, Super Bowl XLVII will go down in history as a unique edition that entertained and captivated audiences as few others have. From its rollercoaster of emotions to the incredible drama unfolding within and outside the stadium, it was truly one for the ages and a lasting reminder of the heights that competitive sports can reach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1901, Dorgan was at a baseball game where vendors were selling sausages in buns, and he drew a cartoon to depict the scene. He supposedly called them \\"hot dogs\\" because the sausages in buns reminded him of dachshund dogs. However, this explanation is often disputed because no evidence of the cartoon exists. Another explanation is that the term \\"hot dog\\" came from German immigrants in the United States who brought their sausages with them. The German immigrants referred to their sausages as \\"dachshund sausages\\" because of their long, skinny shape, resembling the dachshund dog breed. Over time, Americans began to call them \\"hot dogs.\\" Step 4: Provide the answer The exact origin of the term \\"hot dog\\" is unclear, but one popular explanation attributes it to cartoonist T.A. \\"Tad\\" Dorgan in 1901.

Question: Background: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.  Paragraph: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who had several siblings? from the following article ?  Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\".In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England. Giving up her work as a governess, Fuller began to paint full-time, and had opened her own studio before she had...","output":"The last name of the person who had several siblings is Fuller.

Write some highlights for the following article: Once again, the high-profile Cadillac Escalade SUV is the car that thieves love to steal, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute. Each year, 10.8 out of every 1,000 late-model Escalades get stolen, broken into, or have parts ripped off. That's the highest rate of theft claims of any vehicle in America. The Escalade has topped the list since 2002. You may have heard that a lot of Toyota Camrys get stolen. They do. But it's only 1.6 out of every thousand. The institute looked only at cars from the most recent three model years. These cars all have the latest anti-theft technologies, including engine immobilizers that prevent hot-wiring. \\"That won't stop a determined thief from loading a car on a flat-bed truck,\\" said Russ Rader, the institute's spokesman. Take a look at the most-stolen vehicles. According to the institute, the top-ten car-criminal favorites, along with their \\"theft claim frequency\\" per 1,000 vehicles, are:. 1.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines. Q: San Francisco (CNN) -- The three largest U.S. cellular carriers by subscribers sell the latest iPhone, and next week, eighth-place C Spire Wireless will join the group. Some people were taken aback this week when C Spire, which only has stores in Mississippi, Southwest Alabama and Southwest Tennessee, announced that it will begin carrying the iPhone 4 and 4S on November 11. Among those grumbling over the news were some of T-Mobile USA's 33.6 million subscribers. How, they asked, could a regional carrier get the coveted product before one of the big four? C Spire's infrastructure is based on a cell standard used by Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, which now both have the iPhone, but it is not common in other countries. C Spire, formerly Cellular South, has a deal with Verizon so that customers who travel outside of its Mississippi home base can still make calls. Since C Spire's network uses the same underpinnings and antenna bands as Verizon, Apple did not have to make modifications to its phones beyond what it already did for Verizon when it launched there in February. An Apple spokeswoman confirmed that C Spire would begin selling the phone next week, but she did not respond to a question about whether the company needed to modify the hardware. The iPhone 4S, Apple's newest gadget, uses a special antenna receiver from Qualcomm that works on typically incompatible networks. \\"IPhone 4S is now a world phone, so both GSM and CDMA customers can roam worldwide on GSM networks,\\" Bob Mansfield, Apple's head of hardware engineering, says in a promotional video. T-Mobile's network runs on the global standard called GSM. AT&T Mobility also uses GSM. That's what makes T-Mobile an attractive takeover target for AT&T, which plans to bolster its own network using T-Mobile cell towers, as long as the merger is approved. (C Spire, along with Sprint, are suing to block the acquisition, saying it will reduce competition.) While AT&T and T-Mobile use the same basic network infrastructure, their cell signals operate on different antenna bands. That prevents T-Mobile from easily making iPhones run on its network. When asked why C Spire got the iPhone before T-Mobile, Brad Duea, a T-Mobile senior vice-president, smiled, having likely fielded the question before. \\"The iPhone already works with their bands,\\" he said in an interview on Wednesday. \\"They didn't have to change anything.\\" Since the original iPhone came out in 2007, owners have been able to take the devices to T-Mobile, swap out a SIM card and use them on the network. But as Apple has added 3G and faster data speeds for AT&T, the unofficial T-Mobile iPhones -- more than a million in all, T-Mobile has said -- have not been able to exceed 2G speeds. AT&T's and T-Mobile's 3G and so-called 4G networks operate on different bands. Another T-Mobile executive, Cole Brodman, recently addressed the issue publicly at a conference and in a letter to customers, though not in great deal. Executives say that, while they'd like to have the iPhone, Android is a fine alternative to the iPhone.

Apple didn't need to make modifications to its phones for C Spire, as its network is compatible by using the same underpinnings and antenna bands as Verizon.

Here are possible answers to this question: - pleasure - awe inspiring - angry - thinking - painful memories  I believe the correct choice is \\"angry\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"angry\\", and here's the step-by-step justification for this choice: Step 1: Analyze the context of the question The archaeologist is seeing artifacts that he knows are fake. This implies that someone is trying to deceive or mislead the archaeologist by presenting fake objects as genuine. Step 2: Understand the emotions related to the situation Given the situation, the archaeologist has to work with or is confronted by dishonesty and fraudulence. Because of this, they may feel violated, upset, or disrespected. Step 3: Compare possible answers Let's evaluate the emotions in the given options and see which one fits best in the given context. - Pleasure: This emotion doesn't fit the situation, as the archaeologist is being deceived, and it is unlikely they would feel pleasure in this case. - Awe inspiring: Although finding authentic artifacts can be awe-inspiring, the situation involves fake artifacts, so this emotion is not relevant. - Angry: This emotion corresponds to feeling upset or violated when facing dishonesty, making it a likely option for how the archaeologist may feel in this situation. - Thinking: This is a cognitive process rather than an emotion, so it does not fit as a potential answer. - Painful memories: While the situation might evoke some negative memories, this specific emotion does not directly correspond to the immediate context of dealing with fake artifacts. Step 4: Select the best option Based on the analysis, the best emotion that matches the context of the archaeologist seeing fake artifacts is \\"angry\\". Therefore, the correct choice is \\"angry\\" because the archaeologist is being deceived, which can lead to feelings of violation, disrespect, and frustration that are often associated with anger."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The forecast “consensus” of experts for November was for 85,000 net new jobs—a poor performance if it had happened—but with the East Coast devastated by Hurricane Sandy, it was logical to expect a worse performance than October (138,000 revised down from 171,000). Instead, the BLS reported 147,000 net new jobs with no discernible Sandy effects. Really? But it is not the first time this year that the BLS numbers have confounded analysts and seemed to contradict information from other reliable sources. It’s been crazy enough to get Jack Welch to come out of retirement to express his consternation. All this has been amplified by the politics, with each camp spinning the numbers to suit their goals. When the unemployment rate falls, one side will cite it as evidence that things are improving; the other will point out that it fell because people gave up looking for work and dropped out of the labor force, and that the number of long-term unemployed is exceptionally high. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) conducts monthly surveys of a random sample of its 350,000 members. The November survey provides clear evidence that the employment situation in eight states on the East Coast (excluding western New York and western Pennsylvania, not reached by Sandy), deteriorated significantly. During November, owners in the Sandy states increased employment half as frequently as their counterparts in the rest of the U.S. and reduced employment more frequently. Job openings were 4 points lower and, although the same percentage of owners plan to increase employment (create new jobs), nearly one in five plan reductions in employment compared to only 12 percent in the rest of the country. In 2013, this will improve in Sandy states, as cleanup and new construction and repair needs will increase the demand for workers. But both sets of numbers are “recession readings,” so even without Sandy, the numbers were not good. If the BLS November number is really correct (it will be revised next month), would we have had a very good employment month if Sandy had not joined the party? But that would be inconsistent with just about every regional Federal Reserve report on jobs and the ISM Index. Owner optimism plunged in November (10th lowest reading in 37 years of NFIB survey history), and except for the labor market differences discussed above, Sandy owners were just as bummed out as their counterparts elsewhere in the U.S. Consumer confidence faded in the second half of November and plunged in the first half of December. Pessimistic consumers don’t spend as much and that means employment growth will remain sluggish. Looking ahead to 2013, there is one bright light for employment: new construction. We do produce more GDP today than at the peak in 2007, yet we employ four million fewer workers. Some might attribute that to improved productivity, and the most recent report indicated productivity rising at a 2.9 percent rate, well above historical trends. But the real explanation is a change in the mix of GDP. Housing starts fell from a two million unit annual rate at the end of 2006 to only 500,000. This is a very labor intensive business and that blew a hole in the employment numbers. The missing housing (and related activities) was replaced with manufacturing and agricultural output (the dollar was cheap, exports grew), great for our economy, but not much of a job producer. The population grows by three million every year, and they need a place to live. Housing starts have already recovered to the 900,000 level and will reach well past a million units next year, providing a nice boost to employment. That’s something to build a recovery on, if Washington can just convince us that they will not squander the opportunity and scuttle growth with more bad management decisions. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article discusses the confusing and seemingly contradictory government employment statistics and the debate surrounding the true state of the job market. The key points of the article can be summarized as follows: 1. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a higher number of net new jobs (147,000) for November than what was forecasted by experts, despite the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast. This has caused confusion and skepticism among analysts. 2. The interpretation of the employment numbers has been influenced by political agendas, with each side citing the statistics to support their particular argument. 3. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) surveyed its members and found that the employment situation in eight East Coast states significantly deteriorated in November, due to Hurricane Sandy. However, the situation is expected to improve in the coming year as construction and repair efforts increase the demand for workers. 4. The BLS November numbers contradict other regional Federal Reserve reports on jobs and the ISM Index, raising doubts about their accuracy. 5. The article highlights the role of construction, especially housing construction, as a potential source of employment growth in the future. The recovery in housing starts can create more jobs, provided that the government does not interfere negatively with the market. The main takeaway from the article is the uncertainty surrounding the true state of the job market, the skepticism surrounding government employment statistics, and the potential for growth in the construction sector as a source of future employment opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.

Let's start solving: Given equation: -67*t - 410 = -812 Step 1: Isolate the term containing the variable t To do this, we want to get rid of -410 from the left side of the equation. We can achieve this by adding 410 to both sides of the equation. Remember, we can do any operation on an equation as long as we do the same thing to both sides. -67*t - 410 + 410 = -812 + 410 After simplification: -67*t = -402 Step 2: Simplify the equation by performing inverse arithmetic operations Now, to isolate t, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -67, which is the coefficient of the t term.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What word became a derogatory term by 1915? is inside the article: By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora., can you guess it ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: An African migrant has been arrested after walking almost the entire 30 miles underground from Calais to England.      In a “mad race” to reach the UK, Abdul Rahman Haroun, 40, was arrested by British police just steps away from the mouth of the Eurotunnel in Folkestone, Kent.      This is the first incident of a migrant successfully managing to walk the length of the Channel Tunnel where he is believed to have dodged trains travelling at up to 160kph.      It is unclear how Rahman Haroun managed to scale four high fortified fences, evade security patrols, dogs and 400 CCTV cameras inside the Eurotunnel site on the French side.      He is thought to have walked all day in almost complete darkness. He is now facing prison and is unlikely to be able to request asylum.      An alert was sounded at 7.30am on Tuesday after around 500 migrants attempted 600 times to get into the Eurotunnel terminal overnight.      An alarm went off in the southern tunnel at ‘interval 5’ in Calais signalling an “anomaly” and traffic was suspended in the 17km stretch of track while police searched the tunnel area, sparking up to two-hour delays for Shuttle passengers coming to France from the Folkestone end.      Kent Police have confirmed that officers are investigating the incident after Rahman Haroun was located in the Channel Tunnel near to its exit at the Folkestone Terminal at 6.13pm on August 4.      When the alert was called in the morning, tunnel security attempted to track down the migrant who - according to local newspaper Nord Littoral - had embarked on a “mad race at the risk of his life in almost pitch black with trains travelling at 130kph or even 160kph for the Eurostar”.      A test train was sent into the tunnel on the French side with agents and an “intense search” was launched to try and spot the illegal intruder.      However, it was ten hours later that British police intercepted the migrant “a few steps” from the Folkestone entrance.      He has been charged with causing an obstruction to a train using the railway under the Malicious Damage Act 1861 and is due to appear before Medway Magistrates’ Court on August 6.      Eurotunnel has filed a legal complaint in Britain over the incident and officers from Home Office Immigration Enforcement are also investigating.      “This type of criminal intrusion in the tunnel is a very rare event and is both illegal and extremely dangerous,” a Eurotunnel spokesman told Nord Littoral.      Eurotunnel said that it hoped that “the force of law will be used and justice done” so that this attempt does not set a precedent for other migrants to try and do the same.      “Not only did he run a significant risk of being seriously injured or killed, but he has also lost all possibilities to request asylum or find work in England,” a spokesman said.      This is the first time a migrant has managed to walk the entire distance.      The last attempt was in June 2012, when a migrant managed to get into the same southern tunnel stretch but got stuck in a technical storeroom and was later arrested.      Another spent several hours wandering in the Channel Tunnel in March 2010, sparking major disruptions to trains. He was later sentenced to a two-month prison term.      On Saturday night, an organised group of around 200 migrants tried to storm into the Channel Tunnel in the early hours, saying they intended to walk to the UK, tearing down fences and charging past police with tear gas, chanting: “Open the borders!’”.      On Tuesday night, police said that there were 350 fresh intrusions into the Eurotunnel site despite heavy security and 400 migrants around the 650-hectare zone. ||||| The United Nations said dire living conditions for refugees and migrants living in the French port city of Calais, delays in processing asylum applications and the rising number of people dying while trying to reach Britain constitutes a “civil emergency” that won’t slow down for the foreseeable future.      Speaking from Geneva on Friday, Vincent Cochetel, director for Europe at the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said the U.N. has been calling for an “urgent, comprehensive and sustainable response” by Europe, and particularly France, to the crisis for the past year, The Local France reports.      \\"Let's treat that as a civil emergency,\\" Cochetel said, referring to the situation in Calais.      An estimated 3,000 people are living in a Calais camp known as “The Jungle,” while thousands have attempted to enter the Channel Tunnel in recent weeks, which runs underneath the English Channel and connects the U.K. and continental Europe. Ten people have died in the process since the beginning of June, according to UNHCR. The European Union agreed earlier this week to give 78 million to the U.K. and France to help both countries deal with the crisis.      Women and children in Calais are vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking and require particular attention from the French authorities for their protection, said Melissa Fleming, UNHCR spokeswoman, said from Geneva on Friday.      \\"We need a comprehensive package, and we need a sustainable response,\\" said Cochetel. \\"We have had that problem for 14 years.… You don't change geography. This will continue.\\"      British Prime Minister David Cameron came under fire last week from NGOs and opposition lawmakers for referring to the Calais migrants as “swarms of people.” Germany received 73,120 asylum applications in the first three months of 2015, approximately 10 times the number of people who applied for asylum in the U.K. during the same time period, the U.K.’s Channel 4 reports.      Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now      Many living in Calais are refugees from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Syria, but “not all the people gathering in Calais may be refugees,” Fleming said. “Solutions for these other groups may include humane and dignified return to their countries of origin or other countries where they have lived before, in cooperation with the countries of origin and in accordance with international human rights standards,” she said.      Cochetel recently returned from a visit to some of the Greek islands, including Lesvos and Kos, where more than 124,000 refugees and migrants have arrived by sea this year. There is “total chaos” in Greece, said Cochetel. The conditions in the country’s overcrowded and unsanitary reception centers were the subject of a damning Amnesty International report released earlier this year. There has been a “staggering” 750 percent increase in the number of arrivals to Greece this year compared to the same period in 2014 and 50,000 arrived in July 2015 alone, 20,000 more than the previous month, said UNHCR.      The “vast majority” of those arriving in Greece are refugees fleeing from conflict zones or countries that practice human rights violations, according the UNHCR. Syrians fleeing their country’s civil war, which entered its fifth year in March, made up 63 percent of 2015 arrivals to Greece and 70 percent of those who arrived in July 2015 alone.      “Many are in need of urgent medical assistance, water, food, shelter and information. All are exhausted. The reception infrastructure, services and registration procedures are falling far short of real needs,” the U.N. said in a statement Friday.      \\"Such a level of suffering should and can be avoided. The Greek authorities need to urgently designate a single body to coordinate response and set up an adequate humanitarian assistance mechanism,” said Cochetel. “As Greece faces financial challenges the country needs help, European countries should support Greece on these efforts.\\"      Greece is typically the first stop for arrivals before they leave on a journey to other parts of Europe. Cochetel said Greece needs to improve access to its asylum procedure—just 6,200 people applied for asylum by the end of June, a tiny percentage of the overall number of arrivals. The capacity of reception centers on mainland Greece also needs to be increased as up to 450 people, mainly families with young children, are sleeping in the Pedion Tou Areos Park in Athens nightly.      More than 225,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean by boat in an attempt to reach Europe this year, compared with 200,000 last year. More than 2,000 have died or gone missing in the process this year alone. This week, 25 bodies were recovered after a boat carrying an estimated 700 people capsized off the coast of Libya on Wednesday. Around 400 people were rescued, UNHCR reported. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A man from Africa named Abdul Rahman Haroun tried to go from Calais to England by walking almost 30 miles underground through a tunnel called the Channel Tunnel.

Q:Given the following context:  In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu, Dover, which was completed in 1861. Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife.

As the old stereotype goes, German people are always first to bag the sun loungers, and always last to say thank you.

Famed for their punctuality, they also have a reputation for getting straight to the point - which can be perceived as rude by the British. Scroll down for video. Germans are stereotypically thought of as the first with their towels on the sunloungers (posed by models) The explanation is that the country's centuries old divisions may make some feel like they are 'surrounded by enemies'. Because of the nation's fractured past, Germans hold stability, structure and order in high regard. The Goethe Institute have produced a video which explain the misconceptions - and how Germans differ from people of different nationalities. In the clip, a German man is seen standing upright and to attention with a handful of documents while the foreigner - possibly British - sits in a slouched position. Christine Jansen of the Amsterdam branch of the Goethe Institute told website The Local: 'We produced the films as a starting point of a discussion about cultural differences when doing business with Germans.' She added: 'The video-makers attribute Germans' tendency to avoid personal matters in favour of getting straight to the point to history. 'They say the historic division of Germany into several smaller states meant Germans were constantly surrounded by enemies and they kept themselves to themselves.'

The tragedy happened around 3 a.m. Why was a 14-year-old boy out that late without his mother, Shanise Farrar, who called the shooting an assassination? Or his aunt, Quwana Barcene, who said the bloody gun police say was found near his body was part of a coverup? Where was the supervising adult who should have been with a 14-year-old boy walking the streets of New York at 3 o'clock in the morning? \\"I'm not saying that he's the best one, but he's my angel,\\" his grieving mother said.

I'm sure the three teenagers suspected in the death of 23-year-old Christopher Lane -- killed because they allegedly were bored -- started off as angels. But who, besides their parents, would call them angels now? \\"I know my son. He's a good kid,\\" said Jennifer Luna, the mother of the boy prosecutor Jason Hicks said pulled the trigger. As a newspaper reporter, I covered and was around a fair number of crime scenes involving juvenile delinquents and few things bothered me more than listening to their parents. Crying, ranting, proclaiming how great their children were despite being kicked out of school or previous run-ins with the law. That's not to say kids won't be kids. Of course they will be. Which is why it is vitally important that parents be parents. So when kids get bored, they don't think they should go \\"f**k with some n**gers,\\" as then-18-year-old Deryl Dedmon Jr. suggested before he and his buddies ran over and killed 49-year-old auto worker James Craig Anderson, the first black person he saw, with his pickup truck back in 2011. Or randomly shoot a college student jogging down the street as entertainment -- though it seems the shooting may not have been as random as previously thought considering one of the suspects, who is black, tweeted that he hated white people back in April. Parents are supposed to instill a sense of right and wrong in their children and then keep up the due diligence necessary to make sure they don't veer off that path. When parents don't do that, we end up with three 15-year-olds assaulting and breaking the arm of a 13-year-old on a school bus in Florida. \\"This is life. I am sorry what happened to the victim,\\" Julian McKnight Sr., whose son Julian was one of the boys accused in the attack, said after a court appearance. A second appearance is scheduled later this month. \\"It's just the way it is. My son ain't never been no bad person, he just got mixed with bad people, that's all ... he sorry.\\" I am not a perfect parent with all the answers. But I do know that it was the father, and not the son, who was apologizing -- and that, my friends, is our problem in a nutshell. We don't teach accountability, we don't expect accountability and I'm not even sure we even know what accountability looks like anymore. Some of us have become so addicted to pointing fingers at others for all the wrong that happens in our lives that self-assessment has become synonymous with blaming the victim. Yes, there are cultural factors that make parenting difficult. And sometimes a bad seed is just that. But none of this excuses us from taking personal responsibility where we can. I am tired of seeing \\"sorry\\" being used to cloak negligent parents. Sorry won't bring back Christopher Lane or James Craig Anderson. And they, too, were each somebody's \\"angel.\\" If sorry is not good enough to protect a bartender who serves alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person who drives and kills someone, why is sorry good enough for parents who, through negligence, are culpable for the crimes their undisciplined children commit? If my son goes out and breaks the neighbor's window, I have to pay for it. Why is a window more sacred than another human life? We need to hold parents more accountable, both culturally and legally, for the actions of their children. Maybe then more parents will be more engaged in the lives of their children on the front end, rather than the back end, in front of a judge. Society has avenues for juveniles who refuse to obey their parents. But where are the safeguards for society when parents decide not to use those avenues? I'm tired of hearing how good the kids who commit heinous crimes are. Maybe we should start putting parents on the witness stand so they can tell us exactly what they did to raise such perfect children.

The disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range); heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or assistance from a catapult or JATO rocket. For example, the Russian Su-33 is only able to launch from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov with a minimal armament and fuel load. Another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present such as a US Landing Helicopter Dock or Landing Helicopter Assault amphibious assault ship a ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas, this flat deck limits the loading of Harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many STOVL carriers. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): How is the Russian SU-33 unable to launch from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov?","output":"The Russian SU-33 is unable to launch from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov with a full armament and fuel load due to the use of a ski-jump on the carrier for takeoff assistance. Here is a step-by-step explanation to understand why this issue occurs: 1. Heavily laden aircraft need a longer takeoff roll or additional assistance from a catapult or JATO rocket in order to achieve enough speed for lift-off. 2. The ski-jump design on the Admiral Kuznetsov provides some assistance to aircraft during takeoff by converting some of the aircraft's forward momentum into a brief upward trajectory, but this assistance may not be enough for heavily laden aircraft like the SU-33. 3. Due to the limited deck space on the Admiral Kuznetsov, it isn't possible to provide a longer takeoff roll for the heavily laden SU-33, restricting its ability to reach the necessary speed for takeoff. 4. The carrier doesn't have a catapult system or JATO rockets that would provide the additional assistance needed for a heavily laden SU-33 to take off. 5. As a result of these constraints, the SU-33 can only launch from the Admiral Kuznetsov with a minimal armament and fuel load, limiting its effectiveness and range. In summary, the Russian SU-33 is unable to launch from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov with a full armament and fuel load due to the limitations of the ski-jump design on the carrier, the lack of a longer takeoff roll or additional takeoff assistance systems like catapults or JATO rockets."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: When Fox News host Laura Ingraham taunted a Parkland shooting survivor in a Wednesday- ­morning tweet about his college applications being rejected, Twitter users hit back where it hurt most: among her advertisers.      David Hogg, the 17-year-old high school senior who has become a gun-control activist, mustered the collective power of social media — and his more than 630,000 Twitter followers — and urged them to “tweet away” at her top sponsors to call on them to boycott her TV show, “The Ingraham Angle.”      Soooo @IngrahamAngle what are your biggest advertisers ... Asking for a friend. #BoycottIngramAdverts — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) March 29, 2018      Within 24 hours, several companies responded — among them the pet food brand Nutrish and the home goods retailer Wayfair — announcing over Twitter and in media interviews that they would pull their ads from Ingraham’s show.      By Thursday afternoon, Ingraham apologized. “On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” she tweeted.      Any student should be proud of a 4.2 GPA —incl. @DavidHogg111.

For the record, I believe my show was the first to feature David...(1/2) — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 29, 2018      ... immediately after that horrific shooting and even noted how \\"poised\\" he was given the tragedy. As always, he’s welcome to return to the show anytime for a productive discussion. WATCH: https://t.co/5wcd00wWpd (2/2) — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 29, 2018      In the era of boycotts as a byproduct of outrage, with figures such as President Trump threatening the NFL over player protests and airline customers employing the tactic to force change, Hogg’s push for Ingraham’s advertisers to respond to her comments worked remarkably quickly.      The swift results showcase the power that the Parkland survivors have, not just in organizing rallies but in spurring corporate America to act. Brands, too, have become quicker to distance themselves from controversy, whether by denouncing white supremacy after neo-Nazis praise their products or by pulling their sponsorship after another Fox News personality, Bill O’Reilly, was accused of sexual harassment.      Since the 2016 election, calls to boycott retailers have become frequent: The #GrabYourWallet campaign began as a way to protest Trump, and it identified companies that carried merchandise bearing the Trump name. Those calls have been met with equally passionate responses by Trump supporters who say they are determined to use their buying power to stand with the president and his family.      [What happens when neo-Nazis hijack your brand]      On Thursday, #GrabYourWallet co-founder Shannon Coulter called Ingraham’s mocking of Hogg’s college rejections “really egregious violations of basic human decency.”      “Corporate America has a really positive role to play in preventing that kind of targeted harassment,” Coulter said. “It’s not just that one tweet. It’s that [Ingraham is] signaling to her large audience that it’s okay to do that. Particularly when minors are concerned, I think there’s a line that corporations can draw that apparently Laura Ingraham’s parents didn’t draw.”      Ingraham, in addition to apologizing, tried to curtail the damage by noting that Hogg had appeared on her show after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14.      Hogg said he felt the apology was merely an effort to save her advertisers.      “I will only accept your apology only if you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I in this fight,” Hogg tweeted. “It’s time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children.”      I 100% agree an apology in an effort just to save your advertisers is not enough. I will only accept your apology only if you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I️ in this fight. It’s time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children. https://t.co/H0yWs4zMGk — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) March 29, 2018      Ingraham had faced immediate backlash over her original tweet Wednesday from those shocked by her attack on a teenager who had survived the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. Some of them reminded Ingraham, simply, that she was a mother. Hogg’s 14-year-old sister accused the Fox News host of stooping to a “real low” to boost her ratings.      The shooting in Florida — one of several school attacks in 2018 — left 17 students and staff members dead, and it galvanized a new generation of activists, including many teenagers from Parkland.      Hogg has been one of the most vocal, speaking at the March for Our Lives rally against gun violence in Washington. Since the shooting, the teen has appeared frequently on television and rallied his growing number of Twitter followers to become civically engaged if they are frustrated with the status quo.      [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’]      In an interview with TMZ on Tuesday, Hogg spoke about receiving rejection letters from California colleges. Hogg, who has a 4.2 GPA and an SAT score of 1270, was accepted to Florida Atlantic University, California Polytechnic State University and California State University at San Marcos, TMZ reported.      On Wednesday morning, Ingraham tweeted a story from a conservative news site that described Hogg as a “Gun Rights Provocateur” who had not gained acceptance to four University of California schools.      “David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it,” Ingraham tweeted. “(Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA…totally predictable given acceptance rates.)”      David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.) https://t.co/wflA4hWHXY — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 28, 2018      Hours later, Hogg wondered, on Twitter, who Ingraham’s biggest advertisers were and soon compiled a list of 12 companies that his followers could contact.      Before long, Hogg’s tweet was flooded with replies from his supporters, some of whom pasted images of their messages to the companies mentioned. Also responding were people accusing Hogg of “bullying” Ingraham.      At least half a dozen companies have responded to the boycott call.      “We are in the process of removing our ads from Laura Ingraham’s program,” Nutrish tweeted Thursday morning.      TripAdvisor pointed to one of its company values — “We are better together” — in its decision to stop advertising on Ingraham’s show.      “We do not . . . condone the inappropriate comments made by this broadcaster,” TripAdvisor said in a statement. “In our view, these statements focused on a high school student cross the line of decency.”      Online home goods retailer Wayfair told CNBC that Ingraham’s personal criticism of Hogg was “not consistent with our values.”      Nestlé told ThinkProgress it had no plans to buy future ads on the show. Johnson & Johnson, Stitch Fix and Hulu have also joined the boycott.      [The extraordinary number of kids who have endured school shootings since Columbine]      It was unclear whether any of the brands would change their minds after Ingraham apologized.      “We’ve seen corporations years ago pull out from O’Reilly, only to go back and have to pull out again,” said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color Of Change, a nonprofit advocacy group pushing corporations on issues of racial justice.      “The question is, if the corporations do go back, what are they sponsoring? They are sponsoring someone who will use the next tragedy to attack the most vulnerable,” Robinson said. “Laura Ingraham would not exist without corporations enabling her to exist on the air.”      Ingraham was previously criticized for telling professional basketball players to “shut up and dribble” after Cleveland Cavalier LeBron James criticized Trump in an interview.      While Ingraham has been the most recent target of criticism, she is not the only prominent figure who has faced backlash for attacking the high school students.      Just days ago, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and his campaign team were sharply criticized for posting a meme on Facebook about Emma González, another Parkland student and activist. The meme was decried as attacking González’s Cuban heritage.      And CNN contributor and former U.S. senator Rick Santorum had to backtrack after saying students would be better off learning CPR than demonstrating for tighter gun laws.

Wayfair, an e-commerce company, said in a statement that it supports “open dialogue and debate on issues,” but that it would stop advertising on Ms. Ingraham’s show.      “The decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values,” the company said.      Nestle said it had “no plans to buy ads on the show in the future,” while Stitch Fix, a clothing box subscription service, said it had pulled its advertisements. Johnson & Johnson said it had done so as well, while Hulu said on Twitter, “We are no longer advertising on Laura Ingraham’s show and are monitoring all of our ad placements carefully.”      Expedia said it had “recently pulled the advertising” from Ms. Ingraham’s show, but it did not elaborate on timing or whether the decision was related to her comments.      Consumers have increasingly used social media to demand that advertisers respond to a series of controversies, particularly those involving Fox News hosts. Last year, more than 50 brands pulled ads from “The O’Reilly Factor” after The New York Times reported on settlements that the show’s host, Bill O’Reilly, had made with women who accused him of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior, which contributed to his ouster. ||||| Stitch Fix is the latest advertiser to pull support from Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s show.      The online personal shopping service confirmed to The Hill that it would be pulling its ads from Ingraham’s show. HuffPost first reported the development.

According to traditional superstition, such clovers bring good luck, though it is not clear when or how that superstition got started. The earliest mention of \`\`Fower-leafed or purple grasse'' is from 1640 and simply says that it was kept in gardens because it was \`\`good for the purples in children or others''. A description from 1869 says that four-leaf clovers were \`\`gathered at night-time during the full moon by sorceresses, who mixed it with vervain and other ingredients, while young girls in search of a token of perfect happiness made quest of the plant by day''. The first reference to luck might be from an 11-year-old girl, who wrote in an 1877 letter to St. Nicholas Magazine, \`\`Did the fairies ever whisper in your ear, that a four-leaf clover brought good luck to the finder?'' Question: are there such things as four leaf clovers? Available options: (i) no; (ii) yes;","output":"(ii) Yes, four-leaf clovers do exist. They are a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover, which is scientifically known as Trifolium repens, and part of the legume family. What distinguishes a four-leaf clover is the presence of one additional leaflet than the usual three-leaflet clover. The reason why these clovers are rare is due to its genetic mutation and environmental conditions. The exact cause of the genetic variation is not entirely clear, but it's believed to involve a recessive gene inherited from both parents. Four-leaf clovers are renowned worldwide, due to their rarity and the myths and legends associated with them. According to traditional superstition, finding a four-leaf clover is thought to bring good luck to the finder. This belief dates back to folklore and legends from various cultures, and it is likely that it stemmed from the simple rarity of the clover. With an estimated frequency of occurrence being 1 in 10,000, finding a four-leaf clover is quite rare, and thus, it became linked with good luck. Although it's not entirely clear as to when the concept of four-leaf clovers bringing good luck started, there have been several compelling instances traced back to historical documents. From being referenced as \\"fower-leafed or purple grasse\\" in 1640, kept in gardens for its alleged health benefits, to descriptions from 1869 where it was said to be gathered during the full moon by sorceresses, the four-leaf clover has a rich history embedded in our culture. One of the first explicit references to luck being tied to the four-leaf clover comes from an 11-year-old girl's 1877 letter to St. Nicholas Magazine. So, yes, four-leaf clovers are real, with a rare occurrence making them unique and quite special. Their association with good luck and various other folklore stories have contributed to their exalted status in popular culture. Today, they are often reproduced as symbols or motifs used in a wide array of merchandise and media, particularly around St. Patrick's Day, enforcing the popular belief of them being harbingers of good luck."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.  - A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form (the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people).

Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

News article: Tannhäuser; Simon Boccanegra - review Berlin Staatsoper’s ‘hard to fault’ Tannhäuser at the Schiller theatre, with Marina Prudenskaya as Venus and Peter Seiffert outstanding in the title role. Photograph: Bernd Uhlig In Berlin, history and politics dart across your path at every turn. This extends to musical life too. The headline event of Daniel Barenboim's Festtage, the annual spring festival organised by the Berlin State Opera, was an arresting new production of Wagner's Tannhäuser by the German choreographer Sasha Waltz, stunningly performed by a star cast led by Peter Seiffert. Barenboim, at Waltz's request, used the Venusberg ballet music of the 1860/61 Paris edition, combined with the original Dresden score of 1845. In whichever version, Wagner's sprawling exploration of flesh versus spirit contains some of his most potent music. Stand-alone numbers, such as Wolfram's celebrated Song to the Evening Star, had not yet given way to the through-composed structures of his mature works. The one important point to know about its complex chronology, however, is that Wagner had been working on Tristan und Isolde in the intervening years. The new Venusberg music for Tannhäuser, in its languid, extreme chromatic richness, epitomised sexual satiety to an even greater degree, with more excessive freedom, than anything found in Tristan. No wonder Baudelaire, as well as Wilde's Dorian Gray, fell upon this tale of a medieval troubadour as the ultimate hymn to decadence. Last week the promise of a near-naked bacchanal at the start – dancers in none too concealing body stockings tumbling like bugs to the lowest rim of the open-ended cupola which represented the Mount of Venus – had whetted Berliner appetites. One of the first to hurry into the foyer of the Schiller theatre, the company's temporary base while its Unter den Linden home is rebuilt, was a tiny, bright-eyed 100-year-old. His identity, rather than his grand age, are of interest here. Hans Pischner, a virtuoso harpsichordist and musicologist, was one of the most powerful cultural commissars in the GDR period. He was intendant of the Staatsoper for two decades in the last years of a divided Germany, frequently caught in the crossfire of obedience, conservatism and experiment. \\"He was very controversial, close to the state and all that that entails,\\" a Berlin opera insider said, as Pischner walked past us. \\"But now? Hey, he's an old man of a hundred.\\" Pischner's influence was not merely local. Indirectly he changed the shape of opera throughout Europe and America. He supported Ruth Berghaus, the East German choreographer and director who pioneered the updated or abstract productions now known as \\"Regietheater\\" – director's theatre. Hated by the GDR but adored by the west, not least our own English National Opera in productions by David Alden and others, this style now holds sway. Pischner might be proud that Berghaus's 1968 Barber of Seville is still in the Staastoper repertory, receiving its 350th performance just a few weeks ago. The mix of old and new still looks modern. For Tannhäuser, Waltz opted for a simple updating to the 1950s – particularly echoing the wood-panelled Schiller theatre which was built in that decade. Odd though the prancing Thuringian knights looked in tweeds and jodhpurs, nothing was too obtrusive. The dance, mostly independent of the action, was some of the most sympathetic – that is, non-distracting – I have seen in opera. Act 2, the Hall of Song in the Wartburg, looked particularly handsome, with floor-to-ceiling wood swinging like a bamboo screen. The sight, and sound, of 12 horn players striding across the bare stage was thrilling. This relatively low-key approach provided an ideal vessel for the music, in a performance hard to fault. Peter Seiffert, the Heldentenor who recorded the role with Barenboim in 2001, retains a ferocious vocal strength, rarely tiring and never forcing the sound. He carried off the Venusberg love-in rather impressively, looking like a teddy bear among the svelte dancers, and clutching any limb, male or female, that came his way. Marina Prudenskaya's Venus was properly voluptuous and musically secure. Ann Petersen as the virginal Elisabeth, splendid in an Ava Gardner-style satin gown, showed the intelligence and strong-mindedness of a role that can seem merely prudish, making up for some unevenness of tone. René Pape shone as the Landgraf, but the loudest applause, with reason, went to Peter Mattei as Wolfram. The mix of beauty of sound and an ability to act, using silent movie gestures with great expressivity, was as good as it gets. Barenboim, who had conducted the Vienna Philharmonic in Mozart's three final symphonies – from memory – the previous night in the Philharmonie, drawing fresh, noble playing from this finest of orchestras, was in his element. His interpretation never sounded mannered or interventionist (this was true, which may surprise some, in the Mozart too), tempi were steady but never dragged and, from where I was sitting, the orchestra never drowned the singers. The cheers went on for 15 minutes. Less than 24 hours later, Barenboim was back again to conduct Plácido Domingo in a revival of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, rather too safely directed by Federico Tiezzi with plenty of Italianate gothic gold and doge's palace ornamentation. The interest, as ever with Domingo, was to see how he has grown into the role, his voice now sounding more genuinely baritone than when he made the switch from tenor. If there were a few bumps musically, the score not always flowing as freely as it should, Domingo's performance more than made up. To watch this artist grow gracefully into old age, vocally and physically, is a privilege. Next season, Barenboim will celebrate his friend and mentor Pierre Boulez at 90. Why Boulez? Because, Barenboim said at a press conference the morning after Boccanegra – no doubt his idea of relaxation – \\"Pierre has always encouraged the public to listen in a more unconventional way\\". As usual, Barenboim came up with a provocative point of view that made us think. Star ratings (out of 5) Tannhäuser ****Simon Boccanegra *** What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"Alright, my little friend, let's talk about the main parts of this big-kid article. It's all about a big music event with lots of songs and singing. 1. Big Festival in Berlin: Every year, Berlin in Germany has a big music festival in the springtime, organized by the Berlin State Opera. This year, a new show of a famous old song-story called 'Tannhäuser' was a big deal. It was put together by a famous dance-maker named Sasha Waltz, and many famous singers came together to put on a great performance. 2. Hans Pischner visited: A really old man named Hans Pischner, who used to be very important in the music world in Germany, came to see the show. He's a 100 years old! He had a big influence on how operas (big singing-story shows) are done in Europe and America.  3. The show 'Tannhäuser': The review talks a lot about the show 'Tannhäuser'. The lead singer, Peter Seiffert, was really good, and the other singers were also praised, especially Peter Mattei as Wolfram.  4. Other performances: They also played another singing-story called 'Simon Boccanegra'. The writer thinks famous singer Placido Domingo has improved in his singing role, even though the music did have few hiccups here and there. 5. Rating: In the end, the writer gives both of the performances stars out of five to show how much he liked them. Four out of five stars for 'Tannhäuser', and 'Simon Boccanegra' gets three. So it's mainly about the music festival in Berlin, two big performances there, and a 100-year-old visitor. Isn't it exciting how so many people come together just to sing and play beautiful music?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1932, Cohan starred in a dual role as a cold, corrupt politician and his charming, idealistic campaign double in the Hollywood musical film The Phantom President. The film co-starred Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Durante, with songs by Rodgers and Hart, and was released by Paramount Pictures. He appeared in some earlier silent films but he disliked Hollywood production methods and only made one other sound film, Gambling (1934), based on his own 1929 play and shot in New York City. A critic called Gambling a \\"stodgy adaptation of a definitely dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique.\\" It is considered a lost film.  Cohan earned acclaim as a serious actor in Eugene O'Neill's only comedy, Ah, Wilderness! (1933), and in the role of a song-and-dance President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Rodgers and Hart's musical I'd Rather Be Right (1937). The same year, he reunited with Harris to produce a play called Fulton of Oak Falls, starring Cohan. His final play, The Return of the Vagabond (1940), featured a young Celeste Holm in the cast.  In 1940, Judy Garland played the title role in a film version of his 1922 musical Little Nellie Kelly. Cohan's mystery play Seven Keys to Baldpate was first filmed in 1916 and has been remade seven times, most recently as House of Long Shadows (1983), starring Vincent Price. In 1942, a musical biopic of Cohan, Yankee Doodle Dandy, was released, and James Cagney's performance in the title role earned the Best Actor Academy Award. The film was privately screened for Cohan as he battled the last stages of abdominal cancer; Cohan's comment on Cagney's performance was, \\"My God, what an act to follow!\\" Cohan's 1920 play The Meanest Man in the World was filmed in 1943 with Jack Benny.

One day, I complained to my father about having to go milk those cows, saying it was tiring. He said, you know, boy, to work is a blessing. I looked at the men who'd worked harder. I had a feeling I had been told something really important, but it took many years before it sank in.  Back then, going to college was a rare privilege. My father told me if I'd picked something to study that I liked doing, I'd always look forward to my work. But he also added, even having a job you hate is better than not having a job at all. I wanted to be a farmer, but I joined a military program to help pay for college. And what started out as an obligation to the Army became a way of life that I had been devoted to for 37 years. In the late 1980s, during a visit to Bangladesh, I saw a woman with her baby on her back, breaking bricks with a hammer. I asked a local officer why they weren't using a machine to make the work easier. He told me a machine would put that lady out of work. And as bad as that woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive. It reminded me of my father's words: to work is a blessing.  After seeing a lot of people like that woman in Bangladesh, I've come to believe that people without jobs are not free. They're victims of crime, poor health, and depression. People who have jobs can have a home, send their kids to school, develop a sense of pride, contribute to the good of the community and even help others. When we can work, we are free. We are blessed.

Support: A series of leaked emails reveals Asma al-Assad's support for  her husband. Asma al-Assad, the British-born wife of the Syrian president, told a friend in a leaked email that she was the ‘real dictator’ in the family. Mrs Assad, 36, appears to show no misgivings about the regime’s brutal crackdown against dissenters, according to the latest extracts from her private emails. She praises a speech by her husband for conveying a sense of being ‘very strong, no more messing around.’ And she even makes light of the president’s reputation, joking in one exchange with a friend about domestic relations: ‘As for listening - I am the REAL dictator, he has no choice.’ Mrs al-Assad is often portrayed as an unwitting partner to her husband as he conducts a campaign of violence against many of his own people. But the string of emails sent to her husband as well as friends and family members, shows she is, in fact, fully behind his policies. In one message to a family friend she refers to a speech her husband had made describing it as 'very strong, no more messing around'. And she even changed the wording of a viral joke email, to make fun of the people of Homs - the city at the centre of the uprising where the United Nations estimates thousands have been killed. She had received the email - with the subject line 'Student who obtained 0% in exam' - from her husband. But before she forwarded it on to her father and two other family members she changed the wording to read: 'A really bright Homsi student'. In another email her father, Harley Street cardiologist Dr Fawak Akhras, compared the Syrian government's assault on Homs to Britain's reaction to the riots last summer. Mrs Assad, who has three children, grew up in leafy Acton. Although Muslim, she went to a Church of England school, where friends called her Emma. After studying computer science and French literature at King’s College, London, she worked as a banker at JP Morgan in the Nineties when she started secretly dating Bashar, the nerdy former eye doctor being groomed to succeed his despotic father in Syria. Bashar took power in 2000 amidst hopes he would relax the regime and dismantle the network of security forces. But despite many promises, there have been few real changes. The collection of around around 3,000 emails from the private accounts of the couple were obtained by opposition activists who have released them to the media. In one sent to her husband on December 28th she shows she is fully aware just how serious the threat to his regime had got. 'If we are strong together, we will overcome this together .... I love you.' 'We will overcome this together': Despite the killing and oppression of his own people, Bashar al-Assad's wife is standing by him. Although they do not use each others' real names, experts say they are certain the emails are genuine and that the true identities are beyond reasonable doubt. Other emails revealed how, as the fighting in Syria raged, Mrs al-Assad was mainly concerned with how to get around international sanctions that prevented her from shopping online. ‘I am absolutely clueless when it comes to fine jewellery,’ she wrote to her cousin while awaiting a delivery of gold, onyx and diamond-encrusted necklaces being made for her in Paris. In another email she oragnises a delivery of new furniture through a Dubai shipping company. Meanwhile in Syria government forces clashed with gunmen in an upscale neighborhood of the capital Damascus - home to embassies and senior officials - in one of the worst confrontations in the tightly-controlled city center in the country's yearlong uprising. The pro-government reports said the clash left three 'terrorists' and a member of the security forces dead. It said one of the attackers was captured and three security troops were wounded. Shocking violence: Syrians have been left reeling after several bomb attacks in the country's capital. Damascus. Investigators inspect the blast scene outside a damaged building following a car bomb in Syria's second largest city of Aleppo. Shocking violence: Syrians were left reeling after the dramatic blasts at security buildings in the heart of the troubled country's capital Damascus. Damascus has been largely free of the daily shootings and deaths reported across the country since the uprising against Assad began in March last year. But the capital has witnessed several major bomb attacks targeting security facilities, most recently on Saturday. The government blames 'terrorists' for the bombings but the opposition says that the regime itself may be carrying them out to discredit the uprising. The new fighting shows that rebels can still strike in the heart of the capital despite successful government offensive in the past weeks in the suburbs of Damascus, in the central city of Homs and the northern region of Idlib. Supplies: Rebels of the Free Syrian Army, who have sought refuge in the. mountains close to Al-Janoudia village, in Idlib province in northern. Syria, pass food and other supplies to comrades across a river. Defiant: Syrian rebels have set up check-points and road blocks in the north of the Idlib region. Syrian authorities claim the opposition is made up of 'terrorist' groups carrying out a foreign conspiracy. An activist in the capital said the Monday morning clashes occurred near the Political Security Directorate building. He said the clashes were followed with raids by security forces who were searching for the attackers. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of activists throughout Syria, said 18 of Assad's troops were wounded in the clashes. It described the clashes \\"as the most violent of its kind and closest to security centers in Damascus since the revolution began.\\" The rebel Free Syrian Army, which includes thousands of army defectors, have claimed responsibility in the past for attacks against regime forces. The group's leader, Col. Riad al-Asaad, refused to comment on the fighting in Damascus when contacted by The Associated Press by telephone. \\"This is a sensitive military matter that we cannot comment about,\\" he said from Turkey. On Saturday, three suicide bombings in Damascus killed 27 people. Two of them also targeted government security buildings. On Sunday, an explosion killed two and wounded 30 in the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest. Arms deliveries to Syria surged almost 600 percent from 2007 to 2011 compared with the previous five years, a leading think tank said on Monday, with Russia supplying the bulk of the country's weapons. The report underlined how Moscow has continued to supply Syria with firepower while the United States, European Union and others have imposed arms embargoes in response to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's bloody crackdown on unrest. World powers have been unable to stop more than a year of bloodshed in Syria, a country that sits on the fault lines of several regional and ethnic conflicts. Recent army gains against rebel positions have not succeeded in quelling the violence and no negotiated settlement is in sight. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)said Russia had supplied 78 per cent of Syria's weapons imports during the past five years, contributing to a 580 per cent increase in the volume of arms imports by Syria. 'The transfer of arms to states affected by the Arab Spring has provoked public and parliamentary debate in a number of supplier states,\\" said Mark Bromley, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'However, the impact of these debates on states' arms export policies has, up to now, been limited.' Global arms transfers in the period rose by almost a quarter. The five largest importers were all Asian states, with Asia and Oceania accounting for 44 percent of purchases, followed by Europe at 19 percent, the Middle East at 17 percent, the Americas 11 percent and Africa 9 percent. India was the world's single largest importer of arms, accounting for 10 percent of the total, followed by South Korea, Pakistan, China and Singapore. China, the largest recipient of arms during the previous 2002-2006 period, fell in the rankings due to increased domestic production. SIPRI uses a system which attempts to measure volume rather than the financial value of weapons transfers. It does this by using a methodology which intends instead to represent the transfer of military resources. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

The capital city Damascus, normally unscathed by the daily violence across the country, sees a major clash between government forces and gunmen, as well as several major bomb attacks targeting security facilities. The government blames 'terrorists', but the opposition suggests the regime might be behind them. 6. The fighting illustrates that rebels are still capable of striking in the capital, despite successful government efforts elsewhere.  7. Rebel groups such as the Free Syrian Army, which includes army defectors, have claimed responsibility for attacks against regime forces, specifically assaults targeting the Political Security Directorate building. 8.

This conclusion is drawn from the fact that their new favorite meal, Linguine with goat cheese, fresh basil, and grape tomatoes, does not include any meat products. Additionally, their use of ingredients like fresh basil leaves, halved grape tomatoes, and chopped garlic emphasizes their preference for plant-based foods. Vegetarianism is a dietary lifestyle that abstains from consuming meat and may include consuming dairy products and eggs depending on the individual's preferences. Although the other listed lifestyle options (low carb diet, fish only diet, and fruit only diet) could potentially be followed by the narrator, there is not enough evidence to support these in the given context. For instance, a low carb diet would typically involve reducing carbohydrate intake, especially from sources like pasta (like Linguine mentioned). On the other hand, a fish only diet would focus on seafood consumption while avoiding other meat types, but it is not mentioned whether the narrator consumes fish or not. Lastly, a fruit only diet is also less likely since the narrator mentions eating pasta, cheese, and vegetables, which don't fit into a fruit-only food plan.

Available choices:  +yes  +it is not possible to tell  +no","output":"No, based on the premise \\"But it was the adventure of Garibaldi's Red Shirts that imposed the unification of the peninsula in 1860.\\", we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Garibaldi's Red Shirts divided the peninsula.\\" is true. In fact, the premise implies the opposite of the hypothesis. The adventure of Garibaldi's Red Shirts, also known as the Expedition of the Thousand, was a military campaign led by Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1860 aimed at unifying the Italian peninsula under a single, centralized government. Garibaldi and his followers, called the Red Shirts due to their red uniforms, played a significant role in the process known as the Italian Unification or Risorgimento. The Red Shirts along with various political and social forces in Italy sought to reduce the power of the foreign rulers and the Papacy in the peninsula and create a unified, sovereign Italian state. Before the unification, the Italian peninsula was divided into numerous states, including the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Papal States, and several smaller kingdoms and duchies. Garibaldi's Red Shirts successfully launched an expedition in 1860, starting with the invasion of Sicily and then the conquest of Naples. In both cases, the Red Shirts were able to overthrow the ruling Bourbon monarchs and gain control over these territories. As a result, the southern territories were annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia, paving the way for the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. The subsequent unification of Italy, which included territorial acquisitions and the transfer of power from foreign rulers to a central Italian government, can be attributed in part to the efforts of Garibaldi and his Red Shirts. They were not dividing the peninsula, but instead aiming to create a cohesive and unified Italy. In conclusion, the premise suggests that Garibaldi's Red Shirts were instrumental in the unification of the Italian peninsula in 1860 rather than dividing it. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"Garibaldi's Red Shirts divided the peninsula.\\" is not true, and the correct answer is “no.”"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Wal-Mart faces a sex-discrimination suit","output":"Yes, based on the given paragraph, it can be concluded that the statement \\"Wal-Mart faces a sex-discrimination suit\\" is true. This is because the paragraph explicitly states that Wal-Mart is facing a \\"huge\\" sex discrimination lawsuit. It is important to consider the significance of the term \\"huge\\" in this context, suggesting that the suit is likely a significant and potentially impactful legal challenge for the company. Sex discrimination suits involve allegations where an organization is accused of treating employees unfairly or unequally based on their sex or gender. In this case, it is likely that Wal-Mart is faced with accusations of treating their male and female employees differently in ways that are prejudicial to one group. Such lawsuits can have serious consequences for businesses, both financially and reputationally. Firms may be required to pay damages to impacted employees and may face scrutiny from the media, shareholders, and the wider public. Moreover, such lawsuits can lead to changes in business practices and policies to ensure greater equality between male and female employees in the future. For Wal-Mart, facing a \\"huge\\" sex discrimination lawsuit suggests that the company may be dealing with a substantial challenge that could have considerable implications for its future performance and public image. In such cases, it is critical for businesses to address the allegations and make any necessary changes to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws and the fair treatment of employees regardless of their sex. To summarize, based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it can be concluded that Wal-Mart is indeed facing a sex discrimination lawsuit. This type of legal challenge can have significant consequences for the company, both in terms of financial penalties and potential damage to its reputation. Ultimately, it highlights the importance of businesses ensuring they treat all employees equitably and fairly, regardless of their sex, to avoid such legal issues and maintain a positive public image."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him. But many researchers, especially at the start of their careers, don’t... Why isn't achieving impact easy? - impact requires people to have perseverance - impact requires many people - not enough information - Impact requires access The answer is:","output":"Achieving impact is not easy for multiple reasons: 1. Perseverance: Impactful research requires sustained effort and commitment. Researchers need to invest time and resources in building relationships, presenting their work at conferences, and publishing their findings in reputable journals. Perseverance is crucial as the process of creating an impact from research may involve facing numerous challenges and setbacks. 2. Collaboration: Impactful research often relies on the contributions of a diverse range of individuals and organizations. Researchers who collaborate with others in their field or work with various stakeholders, such as government agencies or non-profit organizations, have a higher likelihood of achieving impact. Collaboration helps in maximizing the reach and relevance of the research. 3. Limited information: The early stages of a researcher's career often lack the experience and resources necessary to understand the intricacies of creating impactful research. This may include having a limited network or insufficient knowledge about the best strategies to ensure that their research is communicated effectively. 4. Access: Gaining access to relevant individuals, organizations, and opportunities is a vital part of achieving research impact. Well-established researchers often have more connections and opportunities to spread their research findings. Early-career researchers may struggle to develop these connections, which can make it challenging to gain visibility for their work and contribute to policy or practice change. 5. Fragmented pathways to impact: For some disciplines, such as social and political sciences, the route to achieving impact is more complex and fragmented than in fields like medicine or technology. Impact in these areas may be achieved through a wide range of activities, such as briefings, committee work, networking, and media coverage. This complexity can make it difficult to pinpoint and measure impact. Overall, creating an impact requires a combination of perseverance, collaboration, knowledge, access, and navigating the unique pathways specific to various disciplines. Early-career researchers can face substantial challenges in achieving impact, as they may lack the experience, networks, and resources necessary for success. However, with time and dedication, researchers can develop the skills and connections to create a lasting impact from their work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taproots and fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots. Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot. The growing root tip is protected by a root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells). Root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some habitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots.

How do you drink more water every day? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"The two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question addresses the amount of water lost through breathing, while the second question explores ways to increase daily water consumption. To provide detailed answers to both questions, let's address each separately. 1. How much water does a person lose in a day through breathing? Water loss through breathing is known as insensible water loss and occurs as the body exhales humidified air. The amount of water lost through breathing depends on several factors, including the temperature, humidity level in the environment, and an individual's breathing rate. On average, though, a person loses about 300 to 500 milliliters (approximately 10 to 17 fluid ounces) of water per day through breathing. Factors affecting water loss through breathing include: - Physical activity: Exercise increases the breathing rate, which can lead to increased water loss. - Environmental conditions: Dry air can cause more significant water loss as the air inhaled is humidified to saturation by the body before being exhaled. - Metabolic rate: Water loss through breathing can vary with the metabolic rate, which can fluctuate depending on factors such as diet, age, and overall health. It's essential to replenish the water lost through breathing and other processes by maintaining adequate hydration to ensure the body's proper functioning. 2. How do you drink more water every day? Drinking sufficient water daily helps maintain overall health and bodily functions. Here are some tips for increasing your daily water intake: - Carry a water bottle: Keep a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day to make it easier to drink water wherever you go. - Set reminders: Use your phone, smartwatch, or an app to set reminders to drink water at regular intervals, ensuring you stay on track. - Infuse your water with flavor: Adding fruit, vegetables, or herbs (e.g., lemon, cucumber, or mint) may make it more appealing and help you drink more. - Drink before meals: Drinking a glass of water before meals can help curb appetite and increase water consumption. - Replace other beverages: Replace sugary drinks, soda, and alcohol with water to reduce calorie intake and increase hydration levels. - Use a marked water bottle: Choose a water bottle with measurements on the side to track your daily water consumption easily. - Opt for water-rich foods: Consuming foods with high water content, such as fruits and vegetables, can contribute to your daily water intake. - Establish a routine: Drink water at specific times of the day, such as after waking up, before a workout, or during breaks at work, to create a consistent habit.

Sadie Whitelocks. 19 Kids and Counting star Michelle Duggar has revealed that she sticks to a 5 per person daily food budget in her bustling 20-person household. The 47-year-old, who has nine daughters and ten sons ranging from three to 26 years old with her husband Jim Bob, 48, writes in her blog for TLC that she spends an average of 3,000 a month on groceries. On her family's website she details some of the money-saving meals she likes to rustle up including Broccoli Casserole, Poor Man's Pizza and Three Bean Chilli. Keeping it cheap: 19 Kids and Counting star Michelle Duggar has revealed that she sticks to a 5 per person daily food budget in her bustling household. To save on shopping, Mrs Duggar says she shops for ingredients at discount stores, warehouse clubs and co-ops. She mainly buys in bulk, stocking up once a month on staples including butter, cereal and oats. She will return every three to four days to purchase fresh produce. 'You can save thousands of dollars by doing just that,' the devout Christian matriarch notes. Although she maintains a close rein on the purse strings, Mrs Duggar says she used to be much stricter. Inside the Duggar's pantry: To save on shopping, the family shop for ingredients in bulk at discount stores, warehouse clubs and co-ops. Form an orderly queue! Due to the large size of their family, the Duggars have a deli counter in their kitchen. Just a year ago she was spending around 2,000 every month on food. However, higher food prices meant she had to up her spending. Growing children were another factor. She humorously writes: 'Our boys have grown a lot and they have hollow legs. Josiah, Jedidiah, Jeremiah, and Jason are all tall and lanky. 'I jokingly say every two hours we have to fill up those hollow legs to make them grow a few more inches.' When there are family get-togethers there are even more mouths to feed as Mr and Mrs Duggar also have three grandchildren, from their eldest son, Joshua, 26, who married Anna in September 2008 and moved out of home. Getting in on the act: The Duggars' second eldest daughter Jill with her younger sister Joy. POOR MAN'S PIZZAS. Spread spaghetti sauce on each slice of bread. Sprinkle with cheese bake at 425° for 5 - 10 minutes depending on preference. BROCCOLI CASSEROLE. Saute onions in butter. Cook broccoli as package directs,  drain. Cook rice, combine all ingredients; pour into 9x13 in. dish. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes or until brown. See more Duggar recipes at duggarfamily.com/recipes. Thanks to keeping a close eye on their finances the Duggars -  who will mark their 30th wedding anniversary this July - pride themselves on living debt free. Along with watching what they eat, the couple shop for clothes at thrift stores, scour Craigslist for furniture, and have never brought a new car. Mrs Duggar concludes: 'I'm willing to wait for a little bit to buy things we need. We've already decided we won't go into debt to buy things. 'If our couch wears out, I know I've got 65 to spend on a couch and we’ll look around. Smile for the camera: Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar have nine daughters and ten sons ranging from three to 26 years old, they also have three grandchildren from their eldest son. Home by the range: Where the Duggar family meals are cooked up. 'In the meantime, if our couch falls apart, we'll take it out and just sit on the carpet for a while. It's no big deal. I don’t feel like I need to meet the status quo.' The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 - now 19 - children. The family is conservative Christian and has strong beliefs about issues such as contraception, home-schooling, and spending very little time on the internet or watching TV. They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches that children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.' Addressing their critics, Mr Duggar once said: 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions.' He and his wife announced last year that they were actively trying for another child before their 50th birthdays. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Would \\"The term \\"blended malt\\" replaced \\"vatted malt\\" used under the prior labelling conventions.\\" be a reasonable answer? Choices: (1). No (2). Yes Answer:","output":"(1). No The production process of single malt scotch is quite distinct from the concept of blended malt, and the change in labeling terminology does not provide an exhaustive understanding of how single malt scotch is made. To provide a detailed answer on how single malt scotch is made, here is a step-by-step guide to the production process: 1. Malting: The process starts with malting, where barley grains are soaked in water for a few days to stimulate germination and convert starch into fermentable sugars. The germinated barley, now referred to as \\"malt,\\" is then dried using hot air or traditionally, over a peat fire which gives the final product a distinct smoky flavor. 2. Milling: The dried malt is then sent to a mill, where it is ground into a coarse powder called \\"grist.\\" This process helps to break down the malt's fibrous husk and expose the sugar-rich content inside. 3. Mashing: The grist is then mixed with hot water in a large container called a \\"mash tun.\\" This process extracts fermentable sugars from the malt and creates a sweet liquid known as \\"wort.\\" The wort is then drained from the mash tun, leaving behind the spent grains. 4. Fermentation: The wort is transferred to a fermentation vessel, usually made of steel or wood, where yeast is added. The yeast feeds on the sugars in the wort and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation usually takes about 48-96 hours, resulting in a liquid called \\"wash\\" with an alcohol content of about 7-8%. 5. Distillation: The wash is then distilled in copper pot stills, which help to remove impurities and concentrate the flavors. Single malt scotch undergoes a double distillation process. First, the wash is heated in a \\"wash still,\\" where the lightest and most volatile compounds evaporate, leaving behind heavier compounds in the form of \\"pot ale.\\" The evaporated vapors are then cooled and condensed into a liquid called \\"low wines,\\" with an alcohol content of about 20-25%. The low wines are then distilled again in a \\"spirit still,\\" further increasing the alcohol content and refining the flavors. 6. Maturation: The distilled spirit is transferred to oak casks, where it is aged for a minimum of three years. The casks may have previously held bourbon, sherry, or wine, which can impart unique flavors and characteristics to the final product. As the spirit ages, it interacts with the wood, developing its color, taste, and aroma. The angel's share, the portion of the whisky that evaporates during maturation, also contributes to the final flavor profile. 7. Bottling: Once the scotch has been aged to the desired maturity, it is bottled at its final strength, typically between 40-46% alcohol by volume (ABV). In conclusion, the production process of single malt scotch encompasses several steps, including malting, milling, mashing, fermentation, distillation, maturation, and bottling. \\"The term \\"blended malt\\" replaced \\"vatted malt\\" used under the prior labeling conventions\\" would not be a reasonable description of how single malt scotch is made as it pertains to a different category of scotch whisky altogether that involves blending multiple single malts from different distilleries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to call 911  Make sure the situation requires 911 assistance.  911 is meant to help in situations involving medical emergencies, fires, or crimes in progress. If someone is hurt, injured, or facing another emergency, don't waste time, but do think about whether or not you need this type of assistance. Options are: (1). If the situation requires the assistance of emergency medical services, these should be contacted as soon as possible. If they are unavailable at the moment, have medical assistance at hands. (2). Times when it makes sense to call 911 include (but are not limited to): ' A fire has started and is out of control. A burglary, assault, or other crime is in progress. (3). Further, above all else, support all persons and put others first in case of medical problems. To call 911, you need to file a complaint with the local police station. (4). If you are caring for someone in distress, call emergency services right away or stop at your local emergency room. If the person is ill, your first priority should be to rescue him or her.","output":"(2). Times when it makes sense to call 911 include (but are not limited to): ' A fire has started and is out of control. A burglary, assault, or other crime is in progress. Explanation: This option (2) follows the paragraph best by listing examples of when it is appropriate to call 911, ensuring the reader understands when to utilize emergency services.  Why other answers are wrong: (1). This option adds information about contacting emergency medical services (EMS) instead of providing examples of when to call 911. While related, it does not closely follow the paragraph's context.  (3). This option incorrectly states that calling 911 requires filing a complaint with the local police station. It also adds advice on supporting others in medical situations, which is not relevant to the paragraph's focus on deciding when to call 911. (4).

First question: Is there any material to resist magnetic field lines? Second question: Is there any material to restrict magnetic field? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Available choices: -no; -yes;","output":"First question: Is there any material to resist magnetic field lines? To answer this question, I will research materials that can resist or block magnetic fields. Step 1: Research materials that resist magnetic fields I found that certain materials called \\"mu-metals\\" and \\"superconductors\\" can resist or alter magnetic field lines. Mu-metals are made of nickel, iron, and small amounts of other metals, and they can effectively redirect magnetic field lines. Superconductors, when cooled to near-absolute zero, can repel magnetic fields due to the Meissner effect. Conclusion for the first question: Yes, there are materials like mu-metals and superconductors that can resist magnetic field lines. Second question: Is there any material to restrict magnetic field? To answer this question, I will search for materials that can limit or confine magnetic fields. Step 1: Research materials that restrict magnetic fields During the research, I found that the same materials mentioned earlier, mu-metals and superconductors, can also help restrict or confine magnetic fields. Mu-metals can absorb and redirect magnetic fields, while superconductors can expel magnetic fields when cooled to the appropriate temperature. Conclusion for the second question: Yes, there are materials like mu-metals and superconductors that can restrict magnetic fields. Now to answer whether the two questions are asking the same thing: It seems that both questions are exploring materials that can either resist, block, or confine magnetic fields.

Step 2: Comparing the two: The premise tells us that \\"it was bad\\" when Jimmy Johnson took over and made his decisions, which seemingly conflicts with the result suggested by the hypothesis.  Step 3: Analyzing the contradiction:  The premise suggests negative outcomes following Jimmy Johnson's involvement, while the hypothesis suggests positive outcomes.  Step 4: Conclusions:  Given the negative sentiment in the premise versus the positive sentiment in the hypothesis, we can determine that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The evidence provided in the premise about the situation getting \\"bad\\" since Jimmy Johnson's involvement contradicts the hypothesis suggesting the team started doing \\"better\\" when he came in.  The nature of the premise, therefore, does not logically support the hypothesis based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I read this background article the other day: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.  I am facing a new situation today: Two engineering students learned about petroleum products, While Dan learned more about plastics, Jim learned about fuels.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student learned less about fuels for trains? The answer is:","output":"Dan learned less about fuels for trains. This is because Dan focused more on learning about plastics, which are also derived from petroleum products, but not the specific fuels that power vehicles like trains. On the other hand, Jim specifically concentrated on learning about fuels which are more prominently used to power vehicles such as cars, trucks, airplanes, and trains. Therefore, compared to Jim, Dan acquired less knowledge about fuels for trains."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two men have been arrested by police investigating a spate of tragic deaths among young partygoers believed to have taken contaminated ‘Dr Death’ ecstasy tablets. Five people have died in the last month – three last weekend - just hours after they apparently took the drug. Greater Manchester Police are questioning two men, aged 33 and 34, on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug. It comes after the uncle of the first victim - Charlotte Woodiwiss - yesterday warned other young people not to risk their lives taking the recreational drug. Drug death: Charlotte Woodiwiss died in Derbyshire last month after apparently taking a contaminated drug. Jordan Chambers, 19, from Wigan, left, who died. on Sunday and Gareth Ashton, 28, right, who died on Monday. It is. thought they both took contaminated ecstasy tablets. He made the comments after the funeral of Ms Woodiwiss - who was found dead at a flat in Chapel-en-le-Frith in Derbyshire on. December 22 after apparently taking the ecstasy pill - was held earlier this week. In a heartbreaking Facebook message,. 40-year-old Matt Woodiwiss wrote: ‘I’m Charlotte’s uncle and am absolutely. devastated by my family’s loss. Our beautiful girl gone far too early. I. am heartened by the fact that so many of you have commented but let. this tragic sequence of events teach you a few things. ‘Think. long and hard about how you live your lives, about which group of. people you hang about with and about who influences you. 'It’s. all very well writing a few “nice” things on a FB wall but if you carry. on living your lives as so many of you are then – as much as it seems. like a laugh at the moment – you are running the risk of your families. being torn apart with grief like mine is. ‘So,. by all means quote the poems and write the testimonials, but don’t let. our little girl’s tragic death be in vain. Some of you have the chance. to be shining stars whilst still here, and believe me that is far better. than being one in death. ‘So remember Charlotte with. happiness, remember her vitality, carry on loving her as some of you. did, and most of all learn from this as that is the best testament that. you can give to my beautiful niece.’ It comes as police warned that a. contaminated batch of ecstasy tablets could be circulating following the. deaths of the two 'apparently fit young men' from the same town. Gareth Ashton, 28, died at Wigan Infirmary on Monday while Jordan Chambers, 19, died at Oldham Hospital on Sunday. Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, from Chapel-le-Frith. and Dale Yates, 18, from Buxton, both died in December from apparently. taking contaminated ecstasy pills but Greater Manchester Police are not. connecting their deaths to the two men who died in Wigan. The pair, both from Wigan, were. admitted to hospital after complaining of feeling unwell and suffered. the same symptoms. Both said they had taken drugs. Greater. Manchester Police are investigating where the men had been socialising. and if they were out together when they took the pills. Superintendent Andrea Jones said several others went to hospital yesterday suffering similar symptoms but all have been released. A third man, a 26-year-old, died in. Liverpool on Sunday and is believed to have taken tablets - possibly. ecstasy - before he collapsed. Greater Manchester Police are not. currently linking his death to the two in their region, but said they. could not discount a connection. It comes after the deaths of Ms Woodiwiss. and another partygoer in Derbyshire - Dale Yates, 18,. who was discovered at a flat in Buxton on December 23. It is believed they took Dr Death,. often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and also called Pink Ecstasy, which has. the chemical name PMMA. It. is sold to clubbers for as little as £3 a pill and dealers claim it. offers a similar high to ecstasy (MDMA) but it is around five times as. strong and causes a dangerous rise in body temperature. What the contaminated tablets could look like: Pink coloured ecstasy tablets in a heart shape (stock image) The father of Dale Yates has also warned that young people are playing Russian roulette with their lives by taking the drug. Lawrence Beever, 40, said: ‘So many kids take these recreational drugs but they just don’t know what’s in them. 'They go out to parties, they see their friends taking them, so they have some too, and they don’t realise they’re playing Russian roulette. These pills are deadly.' Derbyshire Police said at the time there. was nothing to link those deaths but issued a warning about drug misuse. as they pointed out illegal drugs and so-called legal highs can have. different strengths and components. Five people were arrested on suspicion. of drug offences following the death of Mr Yates, while six people were. detained over the death of Miss Woodiwiss in Derbyshire. All the suspects were later bailed pending further inquiries. Superintendent Jones today further warned. about the dangers of drug use and said the contaminated pills are. thought to be brightly coloured heart-shaped ecstasy tablets which come. in purple, green, red or yellow. Friends paid tribute to Jordan Chambers, pictured, saying he was 'such a nice lad' who will be 'truly missed' Ms Jones urged anyone with information on such pills to come forward to help them with their inquiries. She said: 'These illegal drugs nobody knows what poisons they contain, what toxic chemicals they contain.' Toxicology tests are due to take place to establish how Mr Ashton and Mr Chambers died. The girlfriend of Mr Ashton, Catherine Fulton, 29, has also urged people to think twice before taking drugs. She said: ‘This has come as a massive shock not least because he wasn’t a drug abuser. I’d tell other people just not to do drugs. 'It ruins the people who are left behind and we have to pick up the pieces. I want this to make people think twice and I hope this opens their eyes to other people’s grief.' Det Con Ms Jones said Wigan is not thought to have. a particular drug problem and that Greater Manchester Police are. liaising with other forces. Detective. Chief Inspector Howard Millington, from Wigan CID, added that he was. concerned there could be further deaths if the drugs continue to. circulate in the area and urged anyone feeling unwell after taking. ecstasy pills to go to hospital for a check-up. 'We are very concerned at how these deaths of two apparently fit young men have occurred,' he added. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

According to Yves Le Bec , the Flettner Fl 282 was the world 's first series production helicopter .  - Anton Flettner (November 1, 1885  December 29, 1961) was a German aviation engineer and inventor. He made important contributions to airplane and helicopter design. He was born in Eddersheim (today a district of Hattersheim am Main).  - A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward, and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft cannot perform.  - A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft, such as an aeroplane, which is capable of flight using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird.  - Hattersheim am Main is a town in the Main-Taunus district, Hesse (Germany) and part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area.  - A rotorcraft or rotary-wing aircraft is a heavier-than-air flying machine that uses lift generated by wings, called rotary wings or rotor blades, that revolve around a mast. Several rotor blades mounted on a single mast are referred to as a rotor. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines a rotorcraft as \\"supported in flight by the reactions of the air on one or more rotors\\". Rotorcraft generally include those aircraft where one or more rotors are required to provide lift throughout the entire flight, such as helicopters, cyclocopters, autogyros, and gyrodynes. Compound rotorcraft may also include additional thrust engines or propellers and static lifting surfaces.  - Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton's second and third laws. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on that system. The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is called thrust. Force, and thus thrust, is measured in the International System of Units (SI) as the newton (symbol: N), and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second.  - C is the third letter in the English alphabet and a letter of the alphabets of many other writing systems which inherited it from the Latin alphabet. It is also the third letter of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. It is named \\"cee\\" (pronounced ) in English.  - A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft is one that can hover, take off, and land vertically. This classification includes fixed-wing aircraft as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as cyclogyros/cyclocopters and tiltrotors. Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off and landing), STOL (short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL (short take-off and vertical landing). Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion. VTOL is a subset of V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing).    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'airplane'. The answer is:","output":"No entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'airplane' in the given paragraphs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - Bari (Bari dialect: Bare;  \\"Bárion\\") is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia region, on the Adriatic Sea, in Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples, and is well known as a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of about 326,799, , over , while the urban area counts 653,028 inhabitants over . The metropolitan area counts 1.3 million inhabitants.  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.  - Lupus Protospatharius Barensis was the reputed author of the Chronicon rerum in regno Neapolitano gestarum ( also called Annales Lupi Protospatharii ) , a precise history of the Mezzogiorno from 805 to 1102 . He has only been named as the author since the seventeenth century . Lupus , along with two other Bariot chronicles , the Annales barenses and the Anonymi barensis chronicon , used some lost ancient annals of Bari up to 1051 . William of Apulia appears to have used these same annals . Lupus also used the lost annals of Matera . Perhaps most unusual to Lupus is his dating method . He began his years in September and so places events of the latter half of a given year in the next year .  - The Normans (Norman: \\"Nourmands\\"; ) were the people who, in the 10th and 11th centuries, gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\\"Norman\\" comes from \\"Norseman\\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Gallo-Roman populations, their descendants would gradually adopt the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia, ultimately resulting in their own assimilation into the Romance society. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.  - William of Apulia was a chronicler of the Normans, writing in the 1090s. His Latin epic, Gesta Roberti Wiscardi (\\"The Deeds of Robert Guiscard\\"), written in hexameters, is one of the principal contemporary sources for the Norman conquest of southern Italy, especially the career of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia (10591085).  - Basilicata (or ), also known as Lucania, is a region in the south of Italy, bordering on Campania to the west, Apulia (\\"Puglia\\") to the north and east, and Calabria to the south. It also has two coastlines, one on the Tyrrhenian Sea between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the Gulf of Taranto between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the \\"instep\\" of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the \\"toe\\" and Apulia the \\"heel\\". The region covers about and in 2010 had a population slightly under 600,000. The regional capital is Potenza. The region is divided into two provinces: Potenza and Matera. The president of Basilicata is Marcello Pittella.  - Matera (or locally ) is a city and a province in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy. It is the capital of the province of Matera and the capital of Basilicata from 1663 to 1806. The town lies in a small canyon carved out by the Gravina.  - Robert Guiscard ( 17 July 1085) was a Norman adventurer remembered for the conquest of southern Italy and Sicily. Robert was born into the Hauteville family in Normandy, went on to become Count of Apulia and Calabria (10571059), and then Duke of Apulia and Calabria and Duke of Sicily (10591085).  - Saint Nicholas; (15 March 270  6 December 343), also called Nikolaos of Myra, was a historic 4th-century Christian saint and Greek Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor (modern-day Demre, Turkey). Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Sinterklaas.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

Movie title: Thick as Thieves Context: Set in New York City, veteran thief Keith Ripley (Morgan Freeman) recruits younger crook Gabriel Martin (Antonio Banderas) to help him pull off one final job in order to repay his debt to the Russian mob, who had killed his previous partner, Victor Korolenko, over the debt before they could complete the plan. Martin is unsure of Ripley, but Ripley's goddaughter, Alexandra Korolenko (Radha Mitchell), who is also Victor's daughter, convinces him otherwise, although Ripley does not like that the two are getting close. Ripley tells Martin the plan, that they are going to steal from a Russian museum that has been smuggling Russian treasures into the country and bribing the NYPD with large donations and expensive equipment. The two infiltrate a party at the museum posing as cops, with Ripley as Lt. Weber (Robert Forster), a cop who has a particular vendetta against Ripley, to gather information about their vault. The Russian mob, led by Nicky Petrovitch (Rade Å erbedÅ¾ija), grow impatient with Ripley and kidnap Alexandra, telling them they must steal two FabergÃ© eggs from the Russian Museum in order to get her back, or she dies. When the duo get into the vaults of the museum with the eggs, Martin reveals he is an undercover cop from Miami planted by Weber to catch Ripley, leaves Ripley locked in the vault and informs Weber, while taking the eggs to the Russian mobster to free Alexandra. After Alexandra is released Martin is forced to meet with Nicky who reveals that the eggs they have stolen are made of wood (like the Karelian Birch egg). Meanwhile, Weber and his squad enter the museum, but are detained by the security guards due to Martin telling the guards he was a cop as he escaped. Martin reports in to the police the next morning after the police have picked up Nicky, only to learn that the man they have in custody is not the man Martin met, and that the man he met was actually Victor Korolenko, who had faked his death with Ripley's help. It is then revealed that Ripley had escaped, letting the museum know... Answer:","output":"They pose as cops to infiltrate the party."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The pancreas creates juices that help digest food - The pancreas releases the juices into the stomach - Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest protein - Insulin is produced to move glucose from the blood - The enzymes begin producing again. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process involves the ingestion of food and its passage through the digestive system up to the point when it reaches the small intestine, where the pancreas plays its crucial role in aiding digestion. This entire process can be broken down into several sub-steps to provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding. Here's the complete process with the missing first step: 1. Ingestion and initial breakdown: The process begins with food entering the mouth, where it is mechanically broken down into smaller pieces by teeth while being mixed with saliva. Saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase, which starts breaking down starches into maltose. 2. Food travels through the esophagus: The chewed food, now called a bolus, is swallowed and travels down the esophagus through peristaltic contractions into the stomach. 3. Further breakdown in the stomach: Once inside the stomach, the bolus is mixed with gastric juices, primarily consisting of hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which help break down proteins into smaller peptides. Gastric lipase, another enzyme present in stomach secretions, begins to break down fats. 4. Chyme formation and release into the small intestine: The churning motions of the stomach muscles turn the mixture of food and gastric juices into a more uniform substance called chyme. The stomach releases the chyme into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. 5. The pancreas creates juices that help digest food: At this stage, the pancreas comes into play. It produces pancreatic juice containing enzymes and bicarbonates, required to neutralize the acidic chyme and further break down food particles. 6. The pancreas releases the juices into the small intestine: Pancreatic juices are released into the duodenum, where they mix with bile produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. 7. Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest protein: The enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin in the pancreatic juices help break down proteins into smaller peptides and individual amino acids. 8. Carbohydrate and fat digestion: Pancreatic amylase breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars, while pancreatic lipase breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. 9. Absorption of nutrients: The broken-down nutrients are absorbed through the lining of the small intestine and transported to the bloodstream or lymphatic system. 10. Insulin is produced to move glucose from the blood: High glucose levels in the bloodstream trigger the pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone directing cells to absorb glucose from the blood and store it as glycogen or use it for energy. 11. The enzymes begin producing again: Once the chyme has been sufficiently processed and the nutrients absorbed, the pancreas resumes producing enzymes and juices in preparation for the next meal. In conclusion, the missing first step in this process is the ingestion of food and its breakdown into smaller particles as it passes through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach, eventually reaching the small intestine where pancreatic secretions become crucial for the efficient absorption of nutrients."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: I have a lot of money and a need to visit a desert, where is my likely destination? Possible A: bank account, race track, casino, supermarket, art show  Why is \\"casino\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Casino\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense as the likely destination for someone who has a lot of money and a need to visit a desert for several reasons. While the other possible answers provided, such as bank account, race track, supermarket, and art show may be legitimate destinations, they do not possess the same combination of factors that make a casino an ideal and logical choice in this scenario.  Firstly, casinos are often associated with an atmosphere of luxury, excitement, and wealth. People with a significant amount of money, as mentioned in the question, might be drawn to the lavish lifestyle that is commonly connected with casinos. High rollers and wealthy individuals often frequent casino establishments to wager substantial amounts of money on various games, which are designed to provide both entertainment and potential financial gains. The prospect of winning more money or the thrill of playing high-stakes games can be appealing to those who have the financial means to engage in such activities, making a casino an attractive option. Secondly, the specific reference to visiting a \\"desert\\" in the question can be linked to one of the most famous and iconic destinations for casinos worldwide – Las Vegas. Situated in the Mojave Desert in the state of Nevada, this city is known for its sprawling casino complexes, flashy entertainment, and glamorous nightlife. The desert environment, combined with its reputation as a gambling hotspot, makes it a logical and enticing destination for someone with a lot of money who is looking for an exciting experience in a desert setting. Furthermore, the other options presented as possible answers bear little to no connection to the combination of having a lot of money and the need to visit a desert. A bank account, while it does handle money, does not involve physically visiting the desert, nor is it an exciting place to visit. Similarly, a supermarket and an art show might be places that are enjoyable for some individuals, but they are not typically found in a desert setting, nor do they cater specifically to a wealthy clientele. A race track, although it can involve gambling, is not closely tied to the desert environment as a casino is in the case of Las Vegas. In conclusion, the answer \\"casino\\" aligns with human common sense as the likely destination for a person who has a lot of money and a need to visit a desert due to its association with wealth, glamorous entertainment, the iconic desert setting of Las Vegas, and the potential for high-stakes gambling and excitement. This connection to money and the desert environment makes it stand out from the other listed options and represents a reasonable and logical choice given the context of the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: For anyone still doubting the belief that our emotions impact our physical health, a new study from New Zealand should be able to settle the matter. It reports that the physical wounds of healthy seniors healed more quickly if they wrote about their most upsetting experiences. This confirms the results of a 2010 study, and extends those findings to cover older adults-a group that is likely to suffer wounds (as from surgery), and one with less access to other ways of lowering tension (such as exercise). Reported in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, a research team led by the University of Auckland's Elizabeth Broadbent made a study featuring 50 healthy adults ranging in age from 64 to 97. They were assigned to write for 20 minutes per day for three consecutive  days. Half were asked to write about the most upsetting experience in their life, describing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and emotions about the events, ideally not previously shared with others. The others were asked to write about their daily activities without mentioning emotions, opinions or beliefs. Two weeks after the third day of writing, all participants received a standard 4mm skin biopsy  on their inner arm. The very tiny wounds caused by the biopsy were photographed regularly over the following days to determine the rate at which they healed. On the 11th day after the biopsy, the wounds completely healed on 76.2 percent of those who had done the expressive writing. That was true of only 42.1 percent of those who had written about everyday activities. \\"The biological and psychological mechanisms   behind this effect remain unclear,\\" the researchers wrote, noting that those who had done the expressive writing did not report lower stress levels or fewer depressive symptoms than the others in the control group. Even if they weren't consciously aware of feeling more relaxed or positive, the expressive writing appeared to have caused some sort of bodily reaction-probably involving their immune systems-that hastened their recovery.

The thieves force the pilot to land so they can dump the passengers. However, the men find the diamonds have already been stolen by someone else (Drake).  Drake is a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. He donates the proceeds of his latest robbery to fund the stalled construction of the \\"New Social Institute\\". He even writes a book, \\"Crackerjack\\": The true story of my exploits., which becomes a bestseller. Everybody is reading it, including the people at Scotland Yard and Baroness Von Haltz, and wondering if it is fact or fiction. The baroness tells her maid Annie that certain passages somehow remind her of Drake, who broke her heart.  By coincidence, she is residing in the same hotel as Drake. He goes to see her, but she does not forgive him for leaving her without a word in Berlin. He explains that he was forced to leave suddenly, but she is not mollified. Meanwhile, Drake instructs Burdge, his secretary, to send a cheque for £10,000 to the Buckingham Hospital for a new wing, even though Burdge informs him he is overdrawn at the bank. Drake tells him that the wealthy Mrs. Humbold's pearls will provide ample funds. The Humbolds are hosting a masquerade ball that night, and the baroness will be there. At the ball, part of the entertainment is a group called the \\"Four Gangsters\\", who have been tied up and replaced by a gang of real gangsters, the same thieves from the aeroplane caper. Sculpie, their leader, kills an unarmed man who foolishly tries to resist. Afterward, however, Sculpie is furious to learn that the pearls he took from Mrs. Humbold are fakes. Once again, Drake has the real ones. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who stole the diamonds is Jack. In the article, it is mentioned that Jack Drake is the one who stole the diamonds from the thieves aboard the airliner. Drake is described as a modern-day Robin Hood, who donates the proceeds of his robberies to fund good causes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At Halfpipe, Warm Temperatures and Grumbling Olympians KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — The day before the much-anticipated men’s halfpipe competition in snowboarding at the Sochi Olympics, there were broad concerns ranging from the shape of the pipe to the warming weather conditions. The problems forced the cancellation of a scheduled training session Monday morning. It was moved to the evening, under the lights, when the temperatures were expected to drop. Shaun White, looking for his third consecutive gold medal in the event, told USA Today Sunday night that the pipe was “not the best.” On Monday, coaches said that the pipe was not cut properly. The area between the vertical walls, called the transition, was both bumpy and asymmetrical, leading to a high number of crashes in training Sunday night. With temperatures well above freezing, the soft snow slowed riders, leaving them unable to elevate to their typical heights. White’s American teammate Danny Davis, speaking to Yahoo, called it “a lame showcase for snowboarding.” Crews worked throughout Monday carving the walls and reshaping the transition. At one point, workers on skis climbed onto the rising slope of the pipe and poked at the walls with rakes. An Australian coach shouted at them to stop because they were damaging the pipe with their tools and their skis. The one-day men’s halfpipe competition is scheduled to begin with qualifications here Tuesday afternoon. The semifinals and finals will follow after dark. The forecast is for a possible mix of rain and snow Monday night, followed by partly cloudy skies Tuesday. Temperatures in the mid-30s are expected during the day, dipping just below freezing by the time of the finals. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The men's halfpipe snowboarding competition at the Sochi Olympics faced concerns due to the shape of the pipe and warming weather conditions, causing the cancellation of a training session.

If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, answer the following question. When did researchers discover eating a lot of fruit can reduce the risk of an aortic aneurysm? The answer is:","output":"Researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm during a study that collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13-year period.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which location most probably didn't suffer land loss or similar processes, location A or location B?  Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined.  Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is most probable that location A didn't suffer land loss or similar processes. Since location A's loss of biodiversity is described as temporary, it suggests that the environmental degradation could be reversible through ecological restoration or resilience.

Think of this article like a story about making good friends.  First, let's talk about staying positive. Wouldn't you like being around friends who are always smiling and happy? Just like when you're playing with your toys and laughing, it makes people want to play with you too. That's what we mean by staying positive. Try to always have a smile on your face and enjoy whatever you're doing. Sometimes things might seem yucky, like eating vegetables or tidying your room, but if we try to find something fun in it, it seems much better! Next, let's think about keeping them talking about themselves. There's nothing people love more than chatting about their favorite things. It's like when you get excited talking about your favorite superhero or the best tree you’ve climbed. When you let your friends talk about what they love, they will be happy and feel good around you. Being witty means being funny and clever. Remember when you told that funny joke about the snail with no shell? That's being witty! Everybody loves a good joke. Jokes and funny stories can make people laugh and feel happy. So, try telling some jokes or fun stories when you're with your friends. Finding common ground is like discovering you and your friend both love the same superhero or both really like going to the park. This is something that connects the two of you, just like when you build a bridge between two piles of blocks. When you find things in common with your friends, it makes your friendship stronger. Avoid over-sharing means not telling everything at once. Like when you're eating candies, you don't want to eat all of them at once, it's better to enjoy them bit by bit. The same way, when you're talking with your friends, it's best to share your stories bit by bit, so that you always have new things to share. And finally, ending on a good note means saying goodbye in a happy way. You know how after playtime, when you and your friend give each other a big high-five and plan your next adventure? That's ending on a good note! It leaves everyone feeling happy and looking forward to the next time you'll be together. So, that's it! Remember these little tips, and you'll make friends easily.

Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most database applications. DBMSs may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions. from databases before the inception of Structured Query Language (SQL).

Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus.  - The Melkite (Greek) Catholic Church (\\"\\") is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See as part of the worldwide Catholic Church. The Melkites, Byzantine Rite Catholics of mixed Eastern Mediterranean (Levantine) and Greek origin, trace their history to the early Christians of Antioch, formerly part of Syria and now in Turkey, of the 1st century AD, where Christianity was introduced by Saint Peter. It is headed by \\"His Beatitude\\" Patriarch Gregory III Laham.  - Gregory III Laham (born Lutfy Laham, December 15, 1933, in Darayya, Syria), Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, and Alexandria and Jerusalem, is the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, elected on November 29, 2000, succeeding Patriarch Maximos V Hakim.  - Macarius IV Tawil ( or Taouil ) was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1813 to 1815 .  - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name.  - The Holy See  is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and formed a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east.

Sometimes, it acts like a ball and rolls around, and other times, it acts squishy, like Play-Doh, and you can squeeze it. Now, wave-particle duality is like that toy. Tiny things, like light and super small particles, can act like both a wave and a particle. They can be like a ball rolling around, or be wavy, like when you see waves in the water. The reason for wave-particle duality is still a bit of a mystery. Some scientists think it's because light and small things can exist in different ways depending on how we look at them or what we're doing with them. Just like how your toy can be a ball or squishy Play-Doh depending on how you want to play with it, these tiny things can act like a wave or a particle in various situations. Now, about your two questions. They are sort of related but not exactly the same. Question 1 is asking for a solution to understand this duality better, and question 2 is asking why duality exists.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Life has changed in Mexico City. Streets normally filled with people are empty. One of the most popular professional soccer teams recently played a game in an empty stadium that can seat more than100,000 people. It's swine   flu that has made life in Mexico City grind to a halt  . Seemingly out of nowhere, swine flu has caused confirmed deaths in 12 countries as of April 30. It has sent a wave of alarm around the world. Governments are trying to find ways to prevent further out-breaks. The World Health Organization has raised its swine flu global threat level to five out of six. People may be familiar with bird flu, but they know little about swine flu. Swine flu is a contagious  respiratory  disease in pigs. It is caused by a type-A influenza virus. Humans can also catch swine flu. The virus causes regular outbreaks in pigs, but people usually do not catch it. However, there have been cases of the virus spreading to people, and then from one person to another. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to the common flu. They include fever, lethargy  , lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea  , and vomiting  . The high proportion of young adults among the deaths is one of several mysteries about this virus. Most of the dead had lung damage. What caused it is not yet known. The virus spreads the same way the common flu does. When an infected person coughs or sneezes around another person, the latter is put at risk. People can get the disease by touching something with the flu virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. There are medicines to treat swine flu. Doctors suggest using anti - viral drugs. They keep the virus from reproducing inside the body. Although there are no vaccines for it now, several everyday steps can help prevent the spread of the virus: washing hands frequently; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and avoiding touching surfaces that might have the virus on it. People may worry that they will get swine flu from eating or preparing pork. In fact,... Answer:","output":"Based on the article, which of the following statements is accurate regarding the swine flu outbreak in Mexico City? A) The swine flu outbreak did not have a significant impact on daily life in Mexico City. B) The swine flu virus is only spread through direct contact with infected pigs.

Here is an article: Eight days ago, the New England Patriots were thinking about an unbeaten season. Now the defending Super Bowl champions are trying to recover from their first back-to-back losses in more than three years. Najee Goode scored on a blocked punt, Malcolm Jenkins returned an interception 99 yards for another touchdown and Darren Sproles took a punt return all the way on Sunday before the Philadelphia Eagles held on for an improbable 35-28 victory over the Patriots. After giving up 45 points in back-to-back games, the response from the Eagles defense and special teams was just what coach Chip Kelly needed to snap a three-game losing streak and propel Philadelphia (5-7) back into the NFC East race. \\"It takes those things to win in this stadium,\\" Kelly said, \\"against that coach and that quarterback.\\" The Patriots took a 14-0 lead before Philadelphia scored five straight touchdowns. Then New England (10-2) came back, taking advantage of an onside kick and a fumble to have a chance to tie the game in the final minute. That's when the Patriots receivers dropped three passes in a row to turn the ball over on downs. \\"Sort of had a chance there at the end. A comeback,\\" coach Bill Belichick said unenthusiastically. \\"But when you give up 21 points when your defense isn't on the field, you're going to lose 98 percent of those games.\\" The Eagles moved into a tie for second in the division with the New York Giants, just a half-game behind Washington, which plays Dallas on Monday night. The Patriots hold a three-game lead over the New York Jets in the AFC East. But what two weeks ago was a comfortable cushion for an undefeated team has shrunk and could, at the very least, cost New England a chance to rest its injured players for the postseason, as Belichick likes to do. Just eight days removed from talk of an undefeated season, the Patriots' injuries began to take their toll. Brady was without tight end Rob Gronkowski, top receiver Julian Edelman and No. 1 running back Dion James, and playing behind a reshuffled offensive line that couldn't protect him. The inline being referenced is no longer available (deleted from the original page). Please select another inline or remove the component \\"We'd love to have everybody healthy. I think everybody would love that,\\" Brady said. \\"It's just not the reality at this point.\\" Still, the Super Bowl MVP gave them a chance. After blowing a 14-point lead for the second straight week, the Patriots snapped out of it for a late charge in the final minutes. Brady threw for a touchdown to make it a two-score game and then, after an onside kick, ran it in from the 1-yard line to cut it to seven points with 3 minutes left. New England's second onside kick failed, but the Patriots stripped the ball from Kenjon Barner on third down to give Brady one more chance. But the comeback fell short when Brandon LaFell, Danny Amendola and Keshawn Martin all had passes come out of their hands in the final 34 seconds. \\"You have a first-ballot Hall of Fame coach, and you have a first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterback -- maybe the best quarterback to ever play the game. Of course you're aware of that,\\" Kelly said. \\"(But) if you spend too much time patting yourself on the back, you're going to lose focus.\\" Darren Sproles had 66 yards rushing, 34 receiving and 115 more on punt returns -- including an 83-yard touchdown that made it 28-14 with 4:18 left in the third quarter. After missing the previous two games with a concussion and left shoulder injury, Sam Bradford completed 14 of 24 passes for 120 yards and two touchdowns. But the Eagles won this one with defense and special teams. The Patriots took a 14-0 lead midway through the second quarter before deciding on the ensuing kickoff to have former rugby star Nate Ebner drop-kick the ball off. It floated behind the first line of defenders, where Seyi Ajirotutu fielded it at his 41. It took eight plays for the Eagles to go 59 yards, with Bradford connecting with Zach Ertz from the 5 to make it 14-7. \\"We threw stuff at them and they handled it,\\" Ebner said. \\"They threw stuff at us that we didn't.\\" The Patriots had a chance to run out the clock, but Brady was sacked and New England was forced to punt with 15 seconds remaining. Ryan Allen's kick was blocked by Chris Maragos; Goode scooped it up and ran it 24 yards for the touchdown to send the teams into the break tied 14-all. Brady had thrown just four interceptions all season, but he was charged with one when Jenkins grabbed a deflection and gave the Eagles a 21-14 lead midway through the third quarter. When the Patriots were forced to punt on their next possession, Sproles broke free for an 83-yard touchdown. The Patriots moved the ball thanks to a direct-snap, end-around pass to Brady that gained 36 yards -- his first reception since 2001. But on the next play, Brady lobbed the ball into the end zone and it was picked off by Byron Maxwell. Bradford led the Eagles on a 12-play drive to make it 35-14 on a 10-yard pass to Jordan Matthews. Brady made it a 14-point game on a 14-yard pass to Scott Chandler, then the Patriots recovered an onside kick. Brady's 1-yard sneak with 3 minutes left made it 35-28. The ensuing onside kick attempt went out of bounds, and Philadelphia ran the clock down to just over 1 minute. On third down, with a chance to run off all but 20 seconds left on the clock, Barner fumbled. NOTES: Brady had never in four previous games against the Eagles thrown an interception. ...

Researchers said that exposure to the chemicals left honeybee hives less likely to survive over winter, while bumblebees and solitary bees produced fewer queens. The study spanned 2,000 hectares across the UK, Germany and Hungary and was set up to establish the \\"real-world\\" impacts of the pesticides. The results are published in Science. Neonicotinoids were placed under a temporary ban in Europe in 2013 after concerns about their impact on bees. The European Commission told the BBC that it intends to put forward a new proposal to further restrict the use of the chemicals. Prof Richard Pywell, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Oxfordshire, who carried out the research, told BBC News: \\"Our findings are a cause for serious concern. \\"We've shown for the first time negative effects of neonicotinoid-coated seed dressings on honeybees and we've also shown similar negative effects on wild bees. \\"This is important because many crops globally are insect pollinated and without pollinators we would struggle to produce some foods.\\" However, Bayer, a major producer of neonicotinoids which part-funded the study, said the findings were inconclusive and that it remained convinced the pesticides were not bad for bees. A growing number of studies have found evidence of a link between neonicotinoids and problems for bees. But there have been questions over whether lab-based research represented what was happening in the wider environment or if the results of field-based studies were merely picking up a simple association between the pesticides and bee impacts rather than direct causation. \\"There was a need to undertake a large-scale, realistic experiment to represent the effects of neonicotinoids on pollinators in the real world,\\" said Prof Pywell. The pan-European trials took place across 33 sites. Bees were exposed to winter-sown oilseed rape that had been treated with two different types of neonicotinoids - Bayer's clothianidin and Syngenta's thiamethoxam - as well as untreated oilseed rape. For bumblebees and solitary bees, the researchers said that in the UK, Hungary and Germany, higher concentrations of neonicotinoid residues found in nests resulted in fewer queens. The scientists also found a type of neonicotinoid called imidacloprid in the wild bee nests. This pesticide was not used in the study, and the team said its presence suggested that despite the 2013 ban, the chemicals were lingering in the environment. For honeybees, the scientists concluded that in the UK and Hungary, exposure to neonicotinoids meant that hives were at risk of dying out over the winter. Prof Pywell said: \\"In the UK, we had high hive mortality.\\" In Hungary, colonies fell by 24% over winter. However in Germany, the scientists found there were no harmful effects on overwintering honeybees. They believe this may be because bee diseases are less prevalent in Germany and the insects also have a wider range of flowers to forage on. Commenting on the research that it had part-funded, Syngenta said the data was valuable but variable. The company highlighted the findings in Germany. It said that if bee habitats and the health of pollinators improved \\"the impact of neonicotinoids can be minimal\\". Dr Richard Schmuck, director of environmental science at Bayer, said: \\"We do not share the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology's interpretation that adverse effects of the seed treatments can be concluded from this study, and we remain confident that neonicotinoids are safe when used and applied responsibly.\\" But environmental campaigners, including Friends of the Earth and ClientEarth, said that the study's findings should prompt the EU to extend the neonicotinoid ban. Prof David Goulson, from the University of Sussex, added: \\"In the light of this new study, continuing to claim that use of neonicotinoids in farming does not harm bees is no longer a tenable position.\\" And Prof Nigel Raine, from the University of Guelph in Canada, said: \\"Whilst results from this large-scale study report varying impacts of neonicotinoid exposure... the overall picture points towards appreciable negative impacts on these important pollinators across the time course of this study.\\" However, Prof Lin Field, at Rothamsted Research, said: \\"My feeling is that no firm conclusions can be drawn from these results. This is perhaps not surprising given that there will be many complicated interactions between different neonicotinoids, different bee species and different field conditions.\\" Data from the study has now been submitted to the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA).  EFSA's report on neonicotinoids in 2013 sparked Europe's temporary ban, and it is now preparing another comprehensive assessment to be released in November. The European Commission is also working on new draft proposals to extend the ban on neonicotinoids. Once they are finalised, EU member states will vote on whether to adopt the new restrictions.  For the UK, with Brexit, any decision may be short lived. Some farmers say that since the ban, their oilseed rape crops have been destroyed by pests. A report by the European Crop Protection Association (ECPA) estimated that the restrictions were costing the farming industry 900 million Euros a year. Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers Union (NFU), told BBC News that in the UK oilseed rape production had fallen by about 20%. \\"We think farmers will always want to grow oilseed rape but without neonicotinoid technology in difficult years it will be more challenging.\\" He added:  \\"While this CEH study provides more useful information, we still don't have that definitive evidence for the impact of neonicotinoids, and yet farmers and food production are hindered by restrictions on these products.\\" There is also now a concern that the pesticides that are currently being used in place of neonicotinoids may be damaging the environment. Many farmers are now spraying oilseed rape multiple times with older chemicals such as pyrethroids. Norman Carreck, at the University of Sussex, said this could result in \\"unknown consequences on bees and other beneficial insects\\". He explained: \\"Further studies are needed to assess the effects of the moratorium on bee populations.\\" A second study published in the journal Science looked at commercial corn-growing areas of Canada. The scientists found that worker bees exposed to neonicotinoids had lower life expectancies and their colonies were more likely to permanently lose queens. Follow Rebecca on Twitter. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses a large study conducted across the UK, Germany, and Hungary, which found that bees exposed to neonicotinoids, a harmful pesticide, are more likely to experience negative effects, such as a higher risk of hives dying out over winter or producing fewer queen bees.

Bayer, a major producer of neonicotinoids, which also part-funded the study, claims the findings are inconclusive. Neonicotinoids were temporarily banned in Europe in 2013 due to concerns about their impact on bees. The European Commission plans to propose further restrictions on the use of these chemicals.

But if it is a professional match, you must ask for permission from the copyright holder before using their footage. 2. Once you have permission, you can edit the video using a video editing software. You can add your own creative touches, like music or graphics that you have permission to use. 3. When your video is ready, you can upload it to YouTube. Make sure to give credit to the original copyright holders in the description. Now, about the second question: How do I post my soccer video on YouTube without getting a copyright infringement? This is related to the first question, but it focuses on your own soccer video. Remember to record your game, edit it with the tools I mentioned before, and give the proper credits in the description. As for whether these questions are the same, they are similar, but not exactly the same. Both questions talk about posting sports videos without copyright infringement, but the first question is about editing sports videos in general, while the second specifically talks about your own soccer video."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer??","output":"Let's break this problem into smaller parts and solve it step by step: First, we have these numbers: 1. 574919 2. -253427 3. 191053 4. -467325 5. 15558 times v, which we can write as 15558*v Our goal is to find the value of 'v'. Now, we will add or subtract the numbers so that we only have 15558*v left on one side: 574919 = 15558*v - 253427 + 191053 - 467325 First, let's combine the two positive numbers: 574919 = 15558*v - 253427 + (191053 - 467325) Now, let's combine the two negative numbers: 574919 = 15558*v + (-253427 - 467325) Now, calculate the combined negative numbers: -253427 - 467325 = -720752 So, now we have: 574919 = 15558*v - 720752 We need to get 'v' alone, so let's get rid of the -720752 by adding 720752 to both sides: 574919 + 720752 = 15558*v Now, calculate the sum on the left side: 574919 + 720752 = 1295671 So, now we have: 1295671 = 15558*v To solve for 'v', we need to divide both sides by 15558: 1295671 ÷ 15558 = v Now, calculate the division: 1295671 ÷ 15558 = 83.27 (rounded to two decimal places) So, the value of 'v' is approximately 83.27."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  A theater  for the following movie plot:  The film centres around the forbidden love of William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) and a noble woman, Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow).As the film begins, Shakepeare's patron Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) finds himself in debt to loan shark Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson). Henslowe offers Fennyman a partnership in the upcoming production of Shakespeare's newest comedy, Romeo and Ethel, The Pirate's Daughter promising that it will be a hit. This play will later be renamed Romeo and Juliet and be reworked into a tragedy (but with some comical undertones with a few characters, like the Nurse).Will Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block and has not completed the play, but begins auditions for Romeo. A boy named Thomas Kent is cast in the role after impressing Shakespeare with his performance and his love of Shakespeare's previous work. Unbeknownst to Shakespeare and the rest of the theater company, Kent is young noblewoman Viola de Lesseps. Viola de Lesseps's dream is to act, but as women were barred from the stage, she must disguise herself as a young man in order to fulfill her dream.After Shakespeare discovers his star's true identity, he and Viola begin a passionate secret affair. There are strong parallels between the pair's romance and the romance in Romeo and Juliet, including the ballroom scene from act 2 and the balcony scene immediately following it. The element of forbidden love forms the basis of Shakespeare's inspiration, and many of their conversations later show up as some of the most famous quotes in the play.Inspired by Viola, Shakespeare begins writing feverishly. His work in progress also benefits from the off-hand advice of playwright and friendly rival Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett). Yet Shakespeare and de Lesseps know that their romance is doomed. Shakespeare is married, albeit long separated from his wife, and Viola is a noblewoman whose parents would never permit her to marry a commoner such as Shakespeare. In fact, Viola's father has privately arranged a betrothal for her to...

Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world, is located within the borders of two countries: Nepal and China. It is specifically situated on the border between Nepal's Sagarmatha Zone, Solu-Khumbu district, and China's Tibet Autonomous Region. The summit itself stands at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. Everest is part of the Himalayas, a great mountain range that runs through five countries: Nepal, India, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan. The mountain has a strong cultural and spiritual significance, especially to the Sherpas of Nepal and the Tibetans. The official local names for the peak are Sagarmatha (Nepal) and Chomolungma (Tibet). Mount Everest has been a popular destination for mountaineering expeditions since the early 20th century. Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa climber from Nepal, were the first to officially reach the summit on 29 May 1953. Nowadays, the mountain attracts many climbers from around the world who attempt to reach its summit for various reasons, including personal achievement, adventure, or as part of scientific or research missions. However, climbing the peak is a challenging and risky endeavor, with many climbers facing harsh weather conditions, altitude sickness, avalanches, and sometimes even fatal accidents. In conclusion, Mount Everest, the highest peak on Earth, is a location that belongs to two countries: Nepal and China. The mountain majestically stands as a natural wonder, a symbol of human perseverance, and a cultural and spiritual landmark for the local residents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the background: Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases.  and the situation: Aaron needs to clean his computer. He buys an air compressor so he can air clean all of the dust from his computer. The compressor forces high powered streams of air by compressing the air inside it then releasing it through a tube.  Answer the following question: Will decreasing pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant increase or decrease its volume? The answer is:","output":"Decreasing the pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant will increase its volume. Step 1: Understand Boyle's Law Boyle's Law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. Step 2: Apply Boyle's Law to the situation In this scenario, the pressure of the container of gas is decreasing while the temperature remains constant. Step 3: Determine the relationship between pressure and volume Boyle's Law explains that the relationship between pressure and volume is inverse. This means that if one variable increases, the other will decrease, and vice versa. Step 4: Apply the inverse relationship to the given situation Because the pressure of the container of gas is decreasing and the temperature remains constant, the inverse relationship tells us that the volume should increase. Therefore, decreasing the pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant will cause the volume of the gas to increase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: MANCHESTER, England -- Here's some good news that vegetarians   can really sink their teeth into: Researchers in UMA Group have developed genetically engineered fruit trees that produce real meat! Fruit from the new Meat Trees, developed by British scientists using the gene technology, is closely like ordinary grape-fruit. But when you cut the fruit open, inside is fresh beef!  \\"Our trees may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's really true,\\" declares Dr. Vincent, director of the UMA Group, which created the amazing trees. \\"Vegetarians have been complaining for years that in spite of their firm belief against eating meat, they still desire the taste of meat once in a while. Now they can have their cake and eat it too.\\"  Although it's taken 12 years to develop the trees, the idea is simple. \\"We take the genes from cattle and put them into the cells of grape-fruit trees,\\" Dr. Vincent says. \\"When the seeds grow into trees, they produce meat instead of ordinary fruit. You get the taste -- even the smell.\\"  Those who've tried the meat agree it tastes like the real thing. \\"I was a bit unwilling to believe at first when I sank my teeth into a hamburger after they told me it grew on a tree,\\" says Londoner Mark, who took part in a taste-test. \\"But it was juicy and delicious - nothing leafy about it at all.\\" Meat Tree products could be on the market in Great Britain by the end of next year. Some vegetarians insist they should never eat meat -- even if it grew on a tree. Others love the idea. \\"My mouth is watering already,\\" says a devoted vegetarian of 20 years. Question: According to what Dr. Vincent said, we know that   _  .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Along with karashi, English mustard is one of the hottest in the world. It is bright yellow in color with a thicker consistency than the mild American mustard. The most famous brand of English mustard is Colman's, which first produced their variety in 1814 as a powder in their yellow tin. William Taylor, based in Newport Pagnell, was the first person to sell English mustard in a prepared format in 1830. What's the best answer to this question: is yellow mustard the same as english mustard?","output":"No, yellow mustard is not the same as English mustard. Although both types of mustard share similarities in their color and basic ingredients, they differ significantly in terms of flavor, heat level, and consistency. Below is a comparison of the two mustard varieties to provide a clearer understanding of their differences: 1. Flavor profile: Yellow mustard, also known as American mustard, has a milder and slightly sweet taste compared to English mustard. It is made using a combination of white and yellow mustard seeds, as well as vinegar, salt, turmeric, and other spices. The presence of turmeric imparts the vibrant yellow hue that is characteristic of this mustard. On the other hand, English mustard has a sharp, pungent, and spicy flavor due to the higher concentration of brown and/or black mustard seeds. Although both mustards are made using similar ingredients such as vinegar and salt, English mustard usually omits sugar and uses water as a liquid ingredient, resulting in a significantly hotter taste. 2. Heat level: As mentioned earlier, English mustard is known for its intense heat, whereas yellow mustard has a milder, more subtle heat. The type of mustard seeds used plays a significant role in determining the heat level. Brown and black mustard seeds used in English mustard are hotter and more pungent than the white and yellow seeds commonly found in yellow mustard. 3. Consistency: Yellow mustard generally has a smoother and more pourable consistency when compared to English mustard. This is because yellow mustard typically contains added liquid ingredients, such as water and vinegar, to achieve a thinner and more spreadable texture. English mustard, on the other hand, often has a thicker consistency and is more likely to be found in the form of a paste or a powder. 4. Uses and pairing: Yellow mustard is known for its versatility in the culinary world, making it a popular condiment for sandwiches, hotdogs, and hamburgers. It can also be found in salad dressings, marinades, and barbecue sauces. Due to its milder flavor, it is more suitable for a wider range of dishes. English mustard, with its strong flavor and powerful heat, is often paired with heartier dishes like roast beef, sausages, and cold cuts. It is also commonly used in cooking, where it imparts a spicy kick to recipes such as casseroles, stews, and sauces. 5. Brands and packaging: The most famous brand of English mustard is Colman's, which is often synonymous with English mustard due to its iconic yellow tin packaging. The first prepared version of English mustard was introduced by William Taylor in 1830. In contrast, yellow mustard brands, such as French's and Heinz, are more prevalent in the United States and internationally. In summary, yellow mustard and English mustard differ in their flavor profile, heat level, consistency, and culinary applications. While both share a basic mustard foundation, the types of mustard seeds and additional ingredients used in their preparation yield distinct taste and texture characteristics. Consequently, they are not interchangeable, and their unique qualities should be considered when selecting a mustard for a specific dish or preference."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Republicans have scored an upset victory in a New York City House race that became a referendum on President Barack Obama's economic policies.      Retired media executive and political novice Bob Turner defeated Democratic state Assemblyman David Weprin (WEHP'-rihn) in a special election Tuesday to succeed Rep. Anthony Weiner, a seven-term Democrat who resigned in June after a sex texting scandal.      The heavily Democratic district spanning parts of Queens and Brooklyn had never sent a Republican to the House. But frustration with the continued weak national economy gave Republicans the edge.      Turner has vowed to bring business practicality to Washington and push back on spending and taxes. |||||       Republican Mark Amodei swept past Democrat Kate Marshall on Tuesday to become Nevada’s newest member of Congress. No surprise there. Republicans far outnumber Democrats in the sprawling, heavily rural district, and recent polling had shown the former state GOP chairman with a near-insurmountable lead.      What analysts will probably debate in the coming days is whether Amodei’s victory (coupled with a stunning Democratic defeat in Tuesday's special congressional election in New York) is an ominous sign for President Obama.      Some things to consider in Nevada, a swing state that Obama won by 12 points in 2008:      Nevada’s 2nd Congressional District is not representative of the entire state, which is more diverse and Democrat-friendly. A Democrat has never won the seat since it was created, though Jill Derby came within five points of Republican Dean Heller in 2006. In fact, Marshall essentially ran as a Republican, castigating Obama’s handling of the economy, including the stimulus package and the continuance of bank bailouts. National Democrats mostly passed on aiding her campaign.      Therefore, Democrats may argue that Marshall was doomed from the get-go.      However, Marshall did revive a line of attack that helped Democrats score a win during a May special election in New York by essentially painting Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who proposed privatizing Medicare for people younger than 55, as a sort of bogeyman. Marshall’s ads showed Amodei praising Ryan’s plan, although he later shied away from supporting its Medicare component.      In turn, Amodei ran ads in which he vows to his mother, Joy, that he will defend the program. “You'd better, Mark. I'm counting on you,” she replies.      Therefore, Republicans may argue that they’ve found a way to undermine an effective Democratic line of attack.      One place to look for answers: Washoe County, which includes Reno and is closely split between the two major parties. Obama banked 55% of the vote here in 2008, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid won the county with 49% of vote during his hotly contested 2010 race. Even so, the Reno area has been walloped by the recession. Its 13% unemployment rate -– with little hope for an imminent rebound -– makes it fertile ground for a potential Obama backlash. Amodei's team aggressively tried to link Marshall to the president and, given her role as state treasurer, to the economic meltdown.      How did Marshall do in Washoe? Well, with 88% of the county's precincts reporting, Amodei was up by 10 points.      OK, everyone. Let the spinning begin.

Usually in New York City, the Democratic team wins, but this time, the Republican team won. The guy who won for Republicans, Bob Turner, said he is going to focus on spending less money and better businesses. Similarly, there was another game in Nevada, where again, the Republican team won. The guy who won there, Mark Amodei was expected to win because there were more Republican team supporters in that place. Now, many people are thinking, if these wins are bad news for President Obama, who is from the Democratic team. Some people think wins in these places do not indicate anything about the President because the places are quite different. But some think that it shows people are unhappy with how President Obama team is playing specifically about money matters.

Question: where does the cold virus live in the body?? Answer:","output":"The cold virus, officially known as the rhinovirus, can inhabit various areas of the human body, but it is most commonly found in the upper respiratory tract which includes the nose, throat, and sinuses. To better understand, let's delve into the process step by step: 1. Initial Entry: The cold virus typically enters a person's body through their nose, mouth or eyes. This can happen when a person comes into direct contact with infected respiratory secretions (for example by shaking hands with a sick person or touching surfaces contaminated with the virus) or by inhaling airborne droplets produced when an infected person sneezes or coughs. 2. Invasion: Once the virus enters the body, it binds to the lining of the nostrils or the conjunctiva (the tissue that lines the eyelids and covers the whites of the eyes). It then gains entry into cells by tricking the cell into thinking that the virus is actually a protein that the cell needs.  3. Proliferation: After the virus has gained entry into a host cell, it begins to replicate or make copies of itself. It hijacks the host cell’s machinery (the ribosomes) and uses it to create viral proteins. These protein parts then assemble into full-fledged viruses. 4. Tactical Spread: The newly formed virus particles then leave the host cell and move on to infect neighboring cells, propagating the infection. This can lead to inflammation and irritation in the nasal passages and throat, causing symptoms typically linked to a common cold such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat. 5. Final Stages: Most cold viruses stay in the upper respiratory tract and do not invade deeper into the body. This is why cold symptoms are generally localized to the nose and throat.  Healthy human bodies are perfectly capable of eliminating the rhinovirus on their own over time. Once the body's immune system detects the presence of the virus, it produces antibodies specifically designed to neutralize it. These antibodies can recognize the virus, bind to it, and mark it for destruction by other immune cells, helping to eventually clear the infection.  Notably, it is the immune response against the virus that often leads to the bothersome symptoms of a cold. So, while you may feel unwell when you have a cold, remember that symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat are actually signs that your body is fighting against the virus. As is common with most viruses, after recovery, the body usually has some period of immunity where it can recognize and quickly eliminate the specific virus strain if exposed again. However, there are over 200 different strains of the cold virus, which is why it is possible to get a cold multiple times."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: Where does a potato become softer?  Here are possible answers to this question: - optical device - garden patch - blender - pantry - vegetable stew  I believe the correct choice is \\"vegetable stew\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"vegetable stew\\". The potato becomes softer in a vegetable stew because it is cooked in liquid, typically a combination of water or broth, along with other vegetables, herbs, and spices. When potatoes are cooked, their cell walls begin to break down, allowing the starch granules to swell and absorb water. The heat generated during the cooking process also turns the starch in the potatoes into a gel-like substance, making them soft and tender.  To further explain why the other options are not correct: 1. Optical device: An optical device has nothing to do with a potato's texture. Optical devices are related to light manipulation, like cameras or lenses, and would not have any impact on the softness of a potato. 2. Garden patch: While a garden patch is where potatoes are grown, they do not become softer there. In fact, they remain in their raw and hard state until they are harvested, prepared, and cooked. 3. Blender: While a blender may cause a potato to be chopped, pureed, or incorporated into other mixtures, it does not inherently make the potato softer – rather, it just changes the form of the potato. The potato still needs to be cooked to become soft. 4. Pantry: A pantry is a storage area for food, so it is not where a potato would become softer. In fact, over time, a raw potato left in a pantry may lose water and start to shrivel, making it even harder. To achieve the desired softness, the potato must undergo the cooking process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

News article: Panthers hang on to edge Coyotes Updated OCT 31, 2014 12:29a ET SUNRISE, Fla. -- Scottie Upshall helped give the Florida Panthers their first home win of the season. Upshall scored at 10:56 of the third period and Roberto Luongo made 32 saves in front of another small crowd and the Panthers earned a 2-1 win over the Arizona Coyotes on Thursday night. Upshall saw the play developing after Derek MacKenzie blocked a shot from the point on the penalty kill. He intercepted a pass and passed it to Tomas Kopecky right after he was leaving the penalty box. Kopecky passed it back to him on the left wing and Upshall made a nice move on Coyotes goalie Mike Smith before lifting the backhand into the back of the net. \\"To be honest I had a plan before the game with a breakaway, but it wasn't what I used. This was something that I kind of had I guess in the back pocket,\\" said Upshall of his fake on Smith. \\"You always in the back of your mind wonder what you're going to do if that puck kind of squirts free on a PK like that and Kopey made a great pass. He hit me last year with one like that and it was a big goal for us and a big PK for our team.\\" The announced crowd on Thursday was 7,691, which was just 380 more than the franchise record low of 7,311 that watched the Panthers' game against Ottawa on Oct. 13th. \\"We're battling hard as a team right now, which is nice. I think defensively, we're playing really well,\\" Luongo said. \\"Our forwards are back-checking hard, putting pressure on the other team and our defensemen are doing a great job of playing the net. We're not scoring many goals but that's OK. If we play well in our systems we'll give ourselves a chance to win every night. The goals will come eventually.\\" Brandon Pirri tied the game in the second period with a power-play goal from the slot at 5:37 of the second period, with Jussi Jokinen and Erik Gudbranson getting the assists. Coyotes goalie Mike Smith stopped 24 of 26 shots. Martin Hanzal scored for Arizona at 17:27 of the first period on the power play on assists from Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Keith Yandle. \\"There's lot of try there,\\" Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said. \\"Smith was very good tonight. But our execution still has to improve if we're going to create more chances to score. We lost on a bad break. Good blocked shot and guy happened to be stepping out of the box.

Home remedies may not help with dark underarms if you're suffering from a condition known as acanthosis nigricans, a skin disorder that results in velvety, light-brown-to-black markings in areas that include the armpits.  This condition can occur as a result of obesity or an endocrine (glandular) disorder. It is frequently found in people with diabetes or a tendency towards diabetes and is most common among people of African descent.    Other possible causes of acanthosis nigricans include Addison's disease, pituitary gland disorders, growth hormone therapy, hypothyroidism or the use of oral contraceptives. If your condition is diabetes related, modifying your diet to restrict starches and sugars may help. If oral contraceptives are at the source of your skin condition, you can try switching to a different form of birth control to see if the condition improves once the medication is stopped. Retin-A, 20% urea, alpha hydroxyacids, and salicylic acid prescriptions may help, but they've been found to be only minimally effective.   The most widely used ingredient in skin lighteners sold in the U.S. is hydroquinone, which is regulated by the FDA. Dermatologists can write prescriptions for lighteners that contain up to 4% hydroquinone.   Over-the-counter skin lighteners can contain no more than 2% hydroquinone.  Always check with your doctor before using a product that contains hydroquinone. Use skin lighteners sold by trusted brands.  Although the FDA banned the use of mercury in skin lightening products in the U.S. in 1990, lightening creams that contain this toxic metal have been found here. These products were manufactured in other countries but sold in stores in the U.S., so read labels very carefully when shopping for this product. All women, but especially those with dark skin run the risk of hyperpigmentation (skin darkening) when they use electrolysis for hair removal.

Question: Given the following context:  The first U.S. Government sponsored expedition to enter Jackson Hole was the 1859–60 Raynolds Expedition. Led by U.S. Army Captain William F. Raynolds and guided by mountain man Jim Bridger, it included naturalist F. V. Hayden, who later led other expeditions to the region. The expedition had been charged with exploring the Yellowstone region, but encountered difficulties crossing mountain passes due to snow. Bridger ended up guiding the expedition south over Union Pass then following the Gros Ventre River drainage to the Snake River and leaving the region over Teton Pass. Organized exploration of the region was halted during the American Civil War but resumed when F. V. Hayden led the well-funded Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. In 1872, Hayden oversaw explorations in Yellowstone, while a branch of his expedition known as the Snake River Division was led by James Stevenson and explored the Teton region. Along with Stevenson was photographer William Henry Jackson who took the first photographs of the Teton Range. The Hayden Geological Survey named many of the mountains and lakes in the region. The explorations by early mountain men and subsequent expeditions failed to identify any sources of economically viable mineral wealth. Nevertheless, small groups of prospectors set up claims and mining operations on several of the creeks and rivers. By 1900 all organized efforts to retrieve minerals had been abandoned. Though the Teton Range was never permanently inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley to the east of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate. The region was mostly suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor's Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to the west side of the Snake River.

Some 65% of American men aged 62-74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with 32% of men with only a high-school certificate. This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-education well off and the unskilled poor. Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled. The consequences, for individual and society, are profound. The world is facing as astonishing rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before. Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600 million to 1.1 billion. The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems. But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled. Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer. The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers   are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce. That even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement. But the changing nature of work also plays a big role. Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation. Technological change may well reinforce that shift: the skills that complement computers, from management knowhow to creativity. Do not necessarily decline with age. What is the result of policy changes in European countries? A) Unskilled workers may choose to retire early. B) more people have to receive in-service training.

One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet.

Is it coming from ahead or behind or from the side?\\" You must think about this all the time on the boat. The wind direction tells you what to do with the sail. Let's start with the wind blowing from the behind. This means the wind and the boat are going in the same direction. Then you must always keep the sail outside the boat. It should be at a 90deg angle   to the boat. Then it will catch the wind best. If the wind is blowing from the side, it is blowing across the boat. In this case, you must keep the sail half way outside the boat. It should be at a 45deg angle to the boat. _ needs to be out far enough to catch the wind, but it shouldn't flap  . It shouldn't look like on a flagpole. If it is flapping, it is probably out too far, and the boat will slow down. Sailing into the wind is not possible.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why?

Write a title for this article: While new satellite images show preparations for what is believed to be a coming long-range missile launch by North Korea, a second attempt in 2012 would be unprecedented, a top satellite image analyst told Security Clearance. There have been four launches of this scale since 1998, including a failed attempt in April of this year. A second launch in 2012 would be the first time North Korea has launched two systems of this class, their largest missile class, in less than three years. \\"The fact that they are now apparently preparing for a second launch in 2012 indicated that the decision to do this was made at the highest level,\\" said DigitalGlobe analyst Joe Bermudez. The North Koreans are looking for \\"maximum political impact\\" domestically, regionally and internationally with a test launch such as this, according to Bermudez, calling it a \\"very politically motivated event.\\" The timing of a launch at the end of this year would coincide with many consequential events, said Bermudez. South Korea will be launching a rocket into space by the end of this week. North Korea and Japan will be holding another set of bilateral talks early in December and the South Korean presidential election will take place in less than a month. North Korea watchers say new leader Kim Jung Un may be responding to internal political pressure from hard-liners to send a message. Details of a new satellite images released in the past few days, including one shot earlier this week, show increased activity at North Korea's Sohae Satellite Launch Station, suggesting a new launch could be possible in the next few weeks, according to DigitalGlobe. The United States has seen activity on the launch pad but does not believe a launch is imminent, U.S. military sources told CNN's Barbara Starr. The newest image at North Korea's Sohae Satellite Launch Station was taken on November 26 and shows similar preparations as was witnessed ahead of the failed April 13th attempt to launch a satellite on top of a long-range missile, the DigitalGlobe analysis concludes Trucks, people, and numerous portable fuel tanks are visible in the images. A new tent has also been erected, pointing to workers on multiple shifts. \\"Because the North Korean ballistic missile and space program is small in nature, there is not a lot of normal everyday activity at these facilities, so when you see something that is different from that norm you tend to watch it with greater interest,\\" said Bermudez. The United States has yet to see a missile on the launch pad, said one of the sources, speaking on the condition no name be used because the source was not authorized to speak to the media about North Korea intelligence. The source added that if there was a launch, it would likely be a long-range missile such as the Taepodong-2 because the Sohae site is a long-range missile launch pad. North Korea claims it is just trying to launch satellites into space during these tests, but the technology could be used for long-range strike capability. \\"While it publicly is stating it is trying to launch a satellite for scientific reasons, we believe the underlying motivation is to develop a intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the United States,\\" said Bermudez. \\"The same technology that you use to place an object into orbit is the same technology that you use for a ballistic missile.\\" Title:","output":"\\"North Korea's Unprecedented Second Attempt: Analyzing Satellite Images and the Geopolitical Impact of a Possible Long-Range Missile Launch in 2012\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film then narrates Robi's initial schooling days, his trip to northern India with his father, publication of his first poem in his father's magazine and his failed attempt for higher education at London. The documentary showcases some of the scenes of Tagore's first drama-opera, Valmiki Pratibha (The Genius of Valmiki), where he used western classical music along with Raga-based songs to narrate sage Valmiki's story and himself acted in the lead role. Mentioning about his marriage with Mrinalini Devi, the documentary explains his aim to form a new school at Santiniketan and its different education system, death of his wife and children in the short span of time and his association in Indian independence movement.

In many countries this is seen as a symbol of respect, mourning, distress, or, in some cases, a salute. Strictly speaking, flags are said to be half-mast if flown from ships and half-staff if on land, although not all regional variations of English use \`\`half-staff.'' Is this statement correct \\"can you fly a flag at half mast\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"can you fly a flag at half mast\\" is generally correct. It refers to the practice of lowering a flag to a position halfway up a flagpole as a sign of respect, mourning, or distress. However, it is important to note that the terms \\"half-mast\\" and \\"half-staff\\" might be used interchangeably depending on regional English variations.  Typically, the term \\"half-mast\\" is used when referring to flags flown on ships, while \\"half-staff\\" refers to flags flown on land. Flying a flag at half-mast (or half-staff) is a widely recognized and accepted practice across many nations, cultures, and organizations. It is seen as a symbolic gesture which communicates a shared sense of loss, remembrance, or solidarity during challenging times. Below is a more detailed explanation of the terms and guidelines for this practice: 1. Respect and mourning: Flying a flag at half-mast is commonly associated with displaying respect and mourning for the passing of prominent figures such as political leaders, public servants, or other high-ranking individuals. This practice is also observed on days designated to commemorate significant events, such as memorial days or anniversaries of tragic incidents. 2. Distress signal: In some cases, a flag flown at half-mast acts as a signal of distress. This can occur in situations where a ship, crew, or group is experiencing an emergency or crisis and seeks assistance. However, it is crucial to verify local regulations and protocols to avoid potential misunderstandings or misinterpretations. 3. Salute: On occasion, flying a flag halfway up the pole may be used as a gesture of salute to honor or acknowledge an individual, institution, or event. This practice may be less common and is generally subject to specific rules or traditions. 4. Protocol: There are different rules and procedures across the world when it comes to flying flags at half-mast. These guidelines often dictate when, how, and for how long a flag should be positioned at half-mast. Observing and adhering to these protocols demonstrates respect and understanding of local customs, traditions, and regulations. 5. Raising the flag: In most instances, a flag is first raised to its peak, and then it is lowered to the half-mast position. This symbolizes the acknowledgment of authority, unity, or the power being above the loss, tragedy, or distress suffered. Similarly, when the flag is to be removed, it is once again raised to its peak before being fully lowered. In conclusion, the statement \\"can you fly a flag at half mast\\" is correct in context. It is vital to understand the significance, protocol, and regional variations of the practice to ensure that the gesture is appropriate and respectful of cultural norms and sensitivities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And, to be clear, I gave his remarks prominence here because the Bank of England was wholly unambiguous about the weight we should attach to them. Admittedly he couched it as the Monetary Policy Committee's meeting in just a few weeks would be the decision-making moment of truth. He never actually said there was a racing certainty of rates rising. But the implication was unambiguous: we should prepare for the end of the era of near-zero interest rates, that has prevailed since early 2009. Well today the Bank of England gave an equally unambiguous signal that the moment of truth for an interest rate rise has been delayed by ten or 12 months, to the latter months of 2016. Which is why I today asked the Bank's governor whether he regretted conditioning us for a tiny rate rise in coming weeks that will now not materialise. He said he didn't, for two reasons. First he said he was speaking only for himself, and of course he is only one vote on the MPC, the body that sets rates. And second, the serious weakening of half the world's economies - China and emerging markets - has dampened UK prices and global growth prospects more than most supposed experts, including those at the Bank, had expected. Or, by implication, he would like us to excuse him, because we can't hold him accountable for events, thousands of miles away in Asia, well beyond the influence of a British central bank. Those external events mean inflation, currently slightly negative, will - the Bank thinks - stay one  percentage point or more below the official target of 2% well into the back end of next year. And on the basis of market expectations of interest rates not rising also till the back end of 2016, inflation is not forecast to return to 2% until the end of 2017. In other words, and to paraphrase master Yoda, bonkers it would be to raise interest rates in December, or January, or February - or not for some considerable time. The reason I mention Yoda is that central bank governors, like Jedi masters, are supposed to be infallible. Maybe that is a ludicrous conceit in this age of institutional transparency. But for City traditionalists, Mark Carney's predilection for giving so-called \\"forward guidance\\", which seems to date to have habitually gone awry, may have damaged his authority a bit. And another thing. We are a nation of obsessives about the value of our homes and the mortgage rates we pay. So a good number of people will have chased supposedly cheap and never-to-be-repeated remortgaging deals after Mr Carney's apparent warning that it would soon call time on free money. Some of those taking out new fixed-rate mortgages may have incurred refinancing costs earlier than strictly necessary. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"In the article, the author highlights the Bank of England's signal that the moment of truth for an interest rate rise has been delayed by ten or 12 months, to the latter months of 2016. The Bank's governor, when asked if he regretted conditioning people for a tiny rate rise in the coming weeks that will now not materialize, stated that he did not for two reasons: he was speaking only for himself as one vote on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), and the serious weakening of half the world's economies, such as China and emerging markets, has dampened UK prices and global growth prospects more than expected. The author also notes the implications of these external events on inflation and the fact that raising interest rates in the near future would be \\"bonkers.\\" Finally, the article mentions concerns that the Bank governor's so-called \\"forward guidance\\" may have damaged his authority a bit, and that people may have incurred refinancing costs earlier than necessary due to taking out new fixed-rate mortgages after Mr. Carney's apparent warning."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. Question: According to the passage, the writer thinks that  _  . - people should not drive in the snow - drivers should think more about problems in winter driving - people drive too fast in winter - winter drivers should stop their cars less The answer is:","output":"drivers should think more about problems in winter driving"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: Among federal agencies, several USACE's district offices Certification have received ISO 9000 certification for their design and construction Here is a hypothesis: Many offices of USACE's received a ISO 9000 certification.  Here are the options:  1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true.  The original premise states that \\"Among federal agencies, several USACE's district offices Certification have received ISO 9000 certification for their design and construction\\". ISO 9000 is a series of quality management system standards designed to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service. it implies standards of quality management that are recognized worldwide, underscoring the organization's commitment to delivering quality and continuous improvement. In the hypothesis, it states that \\"Many offices of USACE's received an ISO 9000 certification.\\" This statement is somewhat less specific than the premise as it does not specify what the certification is for, nor does it mention that it only pertains to federal agencies. However, it aligns with the main idea of the premise in stating that multiple USACE offices have received ISO 9000 certification. However, the premise uses the term \\"several\\" while the hypothesis uses \\"many\\". Both words are somewhat vague and may be interpreted differently by different people. But in this context, \\"many\\" can be considered as a synonym for \\"several\\". Hence, several offices can be seen as many offices, so the premise and hypothesis align in this aspect too. Hence, since the hypothesis suggests the same central idea as the premise, but just with a little less specificity, but essentially does not contradict it, one can reasonably conclude that if the premise is valid, so is the hypothesis. Therefore, this leads us to the conclusion that option 1) yes, is the correct choice in this case."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Examine your feet and ankles when you take off your shoes in the evening. Notice any unusual swelling that does not go down to normal after about half an hour.","output":"In order to treat hyperkalemia effectively, it is essential to follow a step-by-step approach that involves properly addressing the underlying cause, preventing further complications, and restoring normal potassium levels in the body. While swollen feet and ankles can be a sign of other medical conditions, it's important to know that hyperkalemia may not present evident physical symptoms. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to treat hyperkalemia: Step 1: Consult with a medical professional If you suspect hyperkalemia, consult your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They will likely order blood tests to check your potassium levels and may also recommend other tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), to assess your heart's function. Step 2: Address the underlying cause Hyperkalemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including kidney disease, certain medications, dehydration, and trauma. Your healthcare provider will identify the primary cause of your condition and develop a treatment plan to address it. This could involve adjusting your medications, treating kidney disease, or providing intravenous fluids to treat dehydration. Step 3: Follow your healthcare provider's recommendations In order to treat hyperkalemia, your healthcare provider may recommend several strategies, such as: - Removing excess potassium from your body: This is usually done through a process called \\"renal potassium excretion.\\" Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications, such as diuretics or ion-exchange resins, to help your kidneys remove excess potassium. - Stabilizing your heart function: In some cases, hyperkalemia can affect the heart's ability to function properly. If your ECG shows abnormal heartbeat patterns, your healthcare provider may prescribe medications like calcium gluconate or administer a medication called sodium bicarbonate to help stabilize your condition. - Shifting potassium back into cells: If your potassium levels remain high, your healthcare provider may administer medications, such as insulin or albuterol, to help shift potassium from your bloodstream back into your cells. Step 4: Modify your diet If your healthcare provider recommends it, you may be asked to follow a low-potassium diet. This generally involves limiting high-potassium foods like bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and leafy greens. Be sure to consult with a registered dietitian to ensure that you are getting all of the essential nutrients your body needs while following a modified diet. Step 5: Monitor your condition Regular blood tests and check-ups with your healthcare provider are essential to monitor your potassium levels and track your progress. Remember to inform your doctor of any new medications or supplements you may be taking, as they can impact your potassium levels. In conclusion, treating hyperkalemia involves a combination of addressing the underlying cause, adhering to your healthcare provider's recommendations, modifying your diet, and monitoring your condition. Keep in mind that swollen feet and ankles are not necessarily indicative of hyperkalemia; if you are concerned about your potassium levels or experience other symptoms, always consult with your healthcare provider for proper evaluation and guidance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Damien Gayle PUBLISHED: 11:58 EST, 26 February 2013 | UPDATED: 13:03 EST, 26 February 2013 Nintendo is set to release a new miniaturised version of its ground-breaking Wii console in the UK in just a month's time. The Japanese video game maker, which has sold nearly 100 million Wii consoles worldwide, today announced the scaled-down version of the machine will hit the British high street on March 24. Smaller than the original Wii - which has since been superseded by the Wii U - the Mini will come in matte black with a red border. 'Savagely compromised version of the original hardware': Nintendo is set to launch its Wii Mini in the UK next month, but the slimmed down version of their last-generation console has already been savaged by video gamers In a statement today, Nintendo said: 'With a family-friendly design offering no internet capabilities,","output":"the Wii Mini is aimed at providing a simple and affordable gaming experience for all ages. The console will focus on local multiplayer and the wide range of popular Wii games to create a nostalgic and enjoyable atmosphere for players.' The launch of the Wii Mini in the UK is met with mixed reactions from the gaming community. Some appreciate the affordable price and the focus on local multiplayer, while others criticize the lack of internet capabilities and the fact that it's built on last-generation technology. Despite the mixed reviews, the Wii Mini sells consistently in the UK, aided by its affordable price point and a marketing campaign targeting families and casual gamers. By tapping into the nostalgic appeal of classic Wii games, the Mini manages to carve out a niche market of fans who enjoy the simplicity it offers. In the years following the Wii Mini's release, Nintendo continues to innovate and develop new gaming technology, building upon the lessons learned from both the successes and shortcomings of the Wii Mini. The console ultimately enjoys moderate success, catering to a niche audience, but is soon overshadowed by the advancements in gaming systems that offer more features and greater versatility. By the end of the story, the Wii Mini becomes a small, yet significant entry in the history of video game consoles, serving as a testament to Nintendo's ability to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing gaming landscape. And while it may not have had the widespread impact of its predecessors or successors, for those who enjoyed it for what it was, the Wii Mini remains a cherished part of their gaming memories."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why is Cynthia pushing for the narrator to buy a flashlight ?","output":"In the passage provided, Cynthia appears to be insistent upon the narrator to purchase a flashlight, even though the narrator perceives this as absurd. Although there is no explicit information regarding any forthcoming major blackout or event, the context suggests that Cynthia might have some potentially valid reasons for her insistence. Here are several possible explanations for her insistence on the flashlight purchase: 1. Forewarning: It is possible that Cynthia may have knowledge or an intuition about a future power-related issue or disaster that might necessitate having a flashlight at hand. She might have received information from a reliable source or have experienced a recent power outage, prompting her to encourage the narrator to be prepared. Her smile and acknowledgment of the recommendation sounding ludicrous suggest that she is aware that it might seem far-fetched, yet she still feels the need to relay her warning. 2. General Preparedness: Cynthia may be a strong advocate for emergency preparedness and believes in the importance of maintaining essential items for such situations. A flashlight is a fundamental tool to have in emergencies, especially during blackouts or natural disasters, as it can become a lifeline for finding one's way in the dark. In this case, her advice may not be based explicitly on a forthcoming event, but rather on general preparedness and the importance of being ready for unexpected crises. 3. Personal Experience: Cynthia might have had a first-hand experience in the past, in which a flashlight was crucial to her safety or comfort during an emergency. This experience might have left a deep impression on her, leading her to urge others also to have a flashlight at their disposal. She may be empathic towards the potential risks that the narrator might face in similar situations, and hence shares her advice. 4. Concern for the Narrator: Cynthia's motives could also be primarily driven by genuine concern for the narrator's wellbeing. The mention of her smile may indicate that Cynthia wants the narrator to understand she has their best interests at heart and cares about their safety. She may hope that the narrator will trust her judgment and follow her advice, even if it sounds far-fetched. In conclusion, while the passage does not provide explicit information on Cynthia's reasoning behind the urge for the narrator to buy a flashlight, it is evident that there could be several possible explanations. These reasons include a potential forewarning, general preparedness, personal experience, or concern for the narrator's safety. Ultimately, Cynthia's insistence on purchasing the flashlight seems to stem from a desire to ensure the narrator is prepared and well-equipped in a challenging situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The name Proterozoic comes from Greek and means \\"earlier life\\", the Greek root protero-,means \\"former, earlier\\" and zoic-, means \\"animal, living being\\". The Proterozoic Eon extended from to (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the Precambrian Supereon. It is subdivided into three geologic eras (from oldest to youngest): the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic. The well-identified events of this eon were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic; several glaciations, which produced the hypothesized Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian Period in the late Neoproterozoic Era; and the Ediacaran Period (635 to 541 Ma) which is characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied multicellular organisms and provides us with the first obvious fossil evidence of life on earth.  - Laurentia or the North American Craton is a large continental craton that forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent. Many times in its past, Laurentia has been a separate continent as it is now in the form of North America, although originally it also included the cratonic areas of Greenland and also the northwestern part of Scotland, known as the Hebridean Terrane. During other times in its past, Laurentia has been part of larger continents and supercontinents and itself consists of many smaller terranes assembled on a network of Early Proterozoic orogenic belts. Small microcontinents and oceanic islands collided with and sutured onto the ever-growing Laurentia, and together formed the stable Precambrian craton seen today.  - Baltica was a late-Proterozoic, early-Palaeozoic continent that now includes the East European craton of northwestern Eurasia. Baltica was created as an entity not earlier than 1.8 billion years ago. Before this time, the three segments/continents that now compose the East European craton were in different places on the globe. Baltica existed on a tectonic plate called the Baltic Plate.  - Nena was an ancient minor supercontinent that consisted of the cratons of Arctica , Baltica , and East Antarctica . Nena formed about 1.8 billion years ago but became part of the global supercontinent Columbia around 1.1 billions of years ago .  - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain.  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The Precambrian (or Pre-Cambrian, sometimes abbreviated p) is the earliest period of Earth's history, set before the current Phanerozoic Eon. The Precambrian (colored green on the right) is a supereon that is subdivided into three eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic) of the geologic time scale. It spans from the formation of Earth about 4.567 billion years ago (Ga) to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, about million years ago (Ma), when hard-shelled creatures first appeared in abundance. The Precambrian is so named because it preceded the Cambrian, the first period of the Phanerozoic eon, which is named after Cambria, the Latinised name for Wales, where rocks from this age were first studied. The Precambrian accounts for 89% of geologic time.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'temporal range start' with 'paleoproterozoic'. A:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'temporal range start' with 'paleoproterozoic' is the Proterozoic Eon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: \\"What doesn't make a lot of sense here?\\"  Context: \\"Early releases of the Washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as 850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\\".

Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only 1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"What doesn't make a lot of sense in this context is the argument made by some cynics that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent.

Let the speed of the train from Howrah to Patna be S1 and the speed of the train from Patna to Howrah be S2. According to the given information, the time taken for the trains to meet, travel the remaining distance, and reach their destinations are 16 hours and 4 hours respectively. Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours from their start. Using the formula Distance = Speed × Time, the distance each train has traveled at the time of their meeting can be calculated: Distance traveled by the first train: D1 = S1 × x Distance traveled by the second train: D2 = S2 × x As both distances are part of the total distance D, we can write: D = D1 + D2 = S1 × x + S2 × x After the meeting, the first train takes (16 - x) hours to reach Patna, and the second train takes (4 - x) hours to reach Howrah.  Using the Distance = Speed × Time formula again: S1 × (16 - x) = D1 S2 × (4 - x) = D2 Now we have a system of 3 equations: 1) D = S1 × x + S2 × x 2) S1 × (16 - x) = D1 3) S2 × (4 - x) = D2 We already know D1 = S1 × x and D2 = S2 × x, so we substitute these values in equations 2 and 3: S1 × (16 - x) = S1 × x S2 × (4 - x) = S2 × x Now let's solve for x: Dividing both sides of the first equation by S1, we get: 16 - x = x 2x = 16 x = 8 Similarly, dividing both sides of the second equation by S2, we get: 4 - x = x 2x = 4 x = 2 Now, we can find the ratio of their speeds S1 and S2 by using the formula speed = distance/time: S1/S2 = (S1 × 8) / (S2 × 2) S1/S2 = 4 The ratio of their speeds is 4:1, which is not in the given options.

First, let's move the -4*n to the other side by adding 4*n to both sides like this:    66 + 4*n = -4*n + 4*n + 78    66 + 4*n = 78 2. Now we need to move the 66 to the other side to be with the 78. To do this, we'll subtract 66 from both sides:    66 + 4*n - 66 = 78 - 66    4*n = 12 3. Almost there! Now we just need to find what number n is.

In line with this reasoning, psychologist Matt Rossano contends that when humans began living in larger groups, they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality. In small groups, morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation. However, it is much harder to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups. Rossano indicates that by including ever-watchful gods and spirits, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.

Question: The llama trotted much faster on slate than stones because the stones had (A) more resistance (B) less resistance The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is (A) more resistance. To understand why the llama trotted much faster on slate than stones, let's first discuss the differences between slate and stones as surfaces and how they affect the llama's movement. Slate is a fine-grained, metamorphic rock that is composed of clay or volcanic ash. It is often found in large, smooth, and flat layers, which makes it ideal for paving or as a base for other construction purposes. When walking, running, or trotting on slate, the surface offers more consistent and sturdy footing with fewer bumps, unevenness, or crevices that could cause resistance or slow the animal down. On the other hand, stones, in the context of this question, can refer to a surface composed of various size and shaped rocks, sometimes with differences in composition as well. This can include pebbles, gravel, or larger stones, which create an uneven surface. When an animal like a llama tries to trot on stones, it must continually adjust its footing and balance as it encounters different sizes, shapes, and compositions of stones. This causes the stones to have more resistance, which makes it more challenging for the llama to maintain its typical trotting speed. Furthermore, the stability of the stones as a surface is another factor contributing to the increased resistance. When an animal's weight is placed on loose or uneven stones, the stones may shift, roll or slide, requiring extra effort to maintain balance and speed. Smaller stones or gravel can even get lodged in between the animal's hooves or claws, causing discomfort and potentially slowing the animal down. Overall, the answer is that the llama trotted much faster on slate than stones because stones have more resistance. This resistance comes from the increased unevenness, instability, and variability of the stones' surface, making it harder for the llama to maintain its speed and balance compared to the smooth, consistent surface of slate."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Information:  - In Greco-Roman mythology, Aeneas (Greek: , \\"Aineías\\", possibly derived from Greek meaning \\"praised\\") was a Trojan hero, the son of the prince Anchises and the goddess Venus (Aphrodite). His father was a first cousin of King Priam of Troy (both being grandsons of Ilus, founder of Troy), making Aeneas a second cousin to Priam's children (such as Hector and Paris). He is a character in Greek mythology and is mentioned in Homer's \\"Iliad\\". Aeneas receives full treatment in Roman mythology, most extensively in Virgil's \\"Aeneid,\\" where he is an ancestor of Romulus and Remus. He became the first true hero of Rome. Snorri Sturlason identifies him with the Norse Æsir Vidarr.  - Publius Vergilius Maro (traditional dates October 15, 70 BC  September 21, 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He is known for three acclaimed works of Latin literature, the \\"Eclogues\\" (or \\"Bucolics\\"), the \\"Georgics\\", and the epic \\"Aeneid\\". A number of minor poems, collected in the \\"Appendix Vergiliana\\", are sometimes attributed to him.  - Alba Longa (occasionally written Albalonga in Italian sources) was an ancient city of Latium in central Italy, southeast of Rome, in the Alban Hills. Founder and head of the Latin League, it was destroyed by Rome around the middle of the 7th century BC. In legend, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, had come from the royal dynasty of Alba Longa, which in Virgil's Aeneid had been the bloodline of Aeneas, a son of Venus.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Procas or Proca (said to have reigned 817-794 BC) was one of the Latin kings of Alba Longa in the mythic tradition of the founding of Rome. He was the father of Amulius and Numitor and the great grandfather of Romulus and Remus, Rome's legendary founders..  - Aventinus ( said to have reigned 854 - 817 BC ) , one of the mythical kings of Alba Longa , who was buried on the Aventine Hill later named after him . He is said to have reigned thirty - seven years , and to have been succeeded by Procas , the father of Amulius . Servius , in analysing Virgil 's Aeneid , Book vii. 656 , speaks of an Aventinus , a king of the aboriginal inhabitants of Rome , who was killed and buried on the hill afterwards called the Aventine Hill . This king may be conflated with this one or with a separate figure in the Aeneid : \`\` The Aventine is a hill in the city of Rome . It is accepted that it derives its name from birds ( aves ) which , rising from the Tiber , nested there ( as we read in the eighth book of a suitable home for the nests of ill - omened birds ) . This is because of a king of the Aboriginal Italians , Aventinus by name , who was both killed and buried there - just as the Alban king Aventinus was , he who was succeeded by Procas . Varro , however , states that amongst the Roman people , the Sabines accepted this mountain when it was offered them by Romulus , and called it the Aventine after the Aventus river in its area . It is therefore accepted that these different opinions came later , for in the beginning it was called Aventinus after either the birds or the Aboriginal King : from which it is accepted that the son of Hercules mentioned here took his name from that of the hill , not vice versa . ''  - In Roman mythology, King Numitor of Alba Longa, was the son of Procas, descendant of Aeneas the Trojan, and father of Rhea Silvia and Lausus  - In Roman mythology, Amulius was king of Alba Longa who ordered the death of his infant, twin grandnephews Romulus, the eventual founder and king of Rome, and Remus. He was deposed and killed by them after they survived and grew to adulthood.  - The King of Rome was the chief magistrate of the Roman Kingdom. According to legend, the first king of Rome was Romulus, who founded the city in 753 BC upon the Palatine Hill. Seven legendary kings are said to have ruled Rome until 509 BC, when the last king was overthrown. These kings ruled for an average of 35 years.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'aventinus of alba longa' with the relationship of 'position held'.

But recently she has become somewhat mysterious, not so open as before: what if she falls in love, which is too early for a girl of her age. After all, she is reaching the \\"dangerous stage\\". These thoughts have caused trouble in the mother' mind.  One weekend the girl came to tell her mother that she was going to the cinema with her schoolmates and would return late. This was the first time her mother had agreed , and she couldn't help worrying because her daughter had never been away at night before. The mother waited till nine and her uneasiness  got the upper hand over her. She decided to go out to meet her daughter. Just at that moment the noise of a car pulling up drew her to the window and ------there was her daughter, waving goodbye to a boy. Her heart missed a beat. When the girl came in, the mother was watching TV, pretending nothing had happened. \\"Mum, I'm back.\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Sorry to be late. Still sitting up?\\" \\"Yes, Oh, that...

This is because there might be various other factors and scenarios that could lead to the premise being true. We need to consider alternative explanations and gather more evidence to determine whether the hypothesis is true or not. Here are a few alternative scenarios that could lead to the lady with the pink bike smiling for the camera: 1. The lady could be posing for a promotional or advertising campaign, and her smile could simply be part of the photoshoot, unrelated to whether she has bought a new bike. 2. The lady might have been out on a pleasant ride with her friends or family and just happened to be smiling for the camera while enjoying herself, not necessarily because she bought a new bike. 3. The woman might be a professional cyclist or an enthusiast and could be smiling after completing a challenging or enjoyable ride. 4. It's possible that the lady is smiling for reasons unrelated to the bike, such as hearing good news, an amusing joke, or simply being in a joyful mood at the time of the picture. 5. Lastly, the pink bike may even be borrowed or rented, rather than being newly bought, which would challenge the hypothesis. If all we have is the premise stating that a lady with a pink bike is smiling for the camera, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed as true. We would need more information or context, such as a more detailed description of the scene or her emotional state, to determine the exact reason behind her smile."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The bereavement fare was once the airline industry's gift to the traveler, an acknowledgement that a customer was flying for the saddest of reasons: a medical emergency or death in the family. The last thing anyone wanted to worry about was the cost of an airplane ticket. And so many airlines offered discounts to help ease the pain of the journey. Not so much anymore. In the wake of its merger with US Airways, American Airlines this week became the latest major U.S. airline to end its policy of offering bereavement fares. US Airways didn't offer the special fares before the merger, and American's new chief executive officer, Douglas Parker, came from the ranks of US Airways.  OPTIONS: - American's bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. - American Airlines's bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. - Delta Air Lines's bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. - Douglas Parker's bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. - JetBlue Airways's bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. - Southwest Airlines's bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. - U.S.'s bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. - US Airways's bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website. - United Airlines's bereavement policy, which \\"offers additional flexibility on the best published fare,\\" lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website.","output":"The move by American Airlines to end its bereavement fare policy marks an ongoing trend in the airline industry, as more companies prioritize cost-saving measures over customer-compassionate ones. The decision was primarily driven by the recent merger between American Airlines and US Airways, with the latter's CEO, Douglas Parker, transitioning to lead the combined entity. Given that US Airways had not offered bereavement fares before the merger, it is unsurprising that American Airlines has chosen to follow suit. This shift away from offering bereavement fares has sparked debates among frequent flyers and airline professionals alike, with many sharing the sentiment that the industry should continue to support passengers going through extremely difficult and emotional situations. Critics of the policy - or lack thereof - argue that airlines should serve as more than just a transportation provider, but also as a support system within a larger community. Other major carriers in the United States have also reevaluated their bereavement fare policies, with some making adjustments or entirely eliminating the offering. For instance, United Airlines still maintains a bereavement fare policy, which provides customers with additional flexibility on the best published fare, as detailed on their website. However, the policy is now more restrictive in terms of documentation requirements and which relatives qualify for such discounted fares. Delta Air Lines is another US-based carrier that continues to offer bereavement fares, but similar to United, has implemented more stringent conditions and limitations. The policy information available on Delta's website outlines the necessary documentation and qualifying family members. Conversely, airlines like Southwest, JetBlue, and the aforementioned US Airways have decided not to offer bereavement fares at all, citing economic factors and overall shifts in industry practices. While it is clear that the trend among major airlines is moving away from providing bereavement fares, customers and advocates stress the importance of compassion and understanding from the airline industry during times of personal hardship. In light of these policy changes, passengers are encouraged to research their preferred airline's guidelines and allowances before booking last-minute flights for dire family emergencies or losses. Additionally, as airlines continue to assess and evolve their practices, conversation and engagement from the public can help shape how industry leaders approach bereavement fares moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Psychologists say that what we are called has a direct connection with our well-being  .       Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this might due to the association that others made with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, people who are seen as good natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders. The research claims that this association influences the person with the name and so their personality becomes shaped to fit it. Dr David Holmes said, \\"This also has some relation with the original meaning of the name. For example, the original meaning of Judy is 'praised'.\\"      Certain names also work well in certain aspects of life. In the workplace Richard and Judy are happiest, while those called Ruth and Carly are happiest in relationships. At the other end of the scale the unhappiest workers are Stuart and Liz, with the unhappiest in relationships being Frank and Harriet.         Dr Holmes said, \\"The relation we have with certain names, particularly important namesakes , also shapes how we see ourselves and so may have an effect on our confidence. Names are like product brands in having a powerful effect on attitudes and should therefore be chosen with care.\\"       \\"Other names are connected with being brave, outgoing or serious. Therefore, many celebrities change their names to ones which reflect these characteristics. This, in turn, influences parents when they choose names for their babies,\\" said Dr Holmes, \\"however, names connected with ordinary people are seldom chosen for their babies\\". What's the main idea of this passage? A) How to choose a good name for babies. B) How to achieve success by changing a good name. C) The relation between names and success.

Background: Amy Marcy Cheney Beach (September 5, 1867 - December 27, 1944) was an American composer and pianist. She was the first successful American female composer of large-scale art music. Her \\"Gaelic\\" Symphony, premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1896, was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. She was one of the first American composers to succeed without the benefit of European training, and one of the most respected and acclaimed American composers of her era. Context: Amy Marcy Cheney was born in Henniker, New Hampshire to Charles Abbott Cheney (nephew of Oren B. Cheney, who founded Bates College) and Clara Imogene Marcy Cheney. Artistic ability appears to have run in the family: Clara was reputedly an \\"excellent pianist and singer,\\", and had a sister named Emma Francis \\"Franc\\" Marcy, who taught voice and piano in Boston. Emma's daughter Ethel, who \\"displayed a talent for art,\\" went \\"to study in New York, Boston, and twice to Paris\\" during the 1890s.  Amy showed every sign of a child prodigy. She was able to sing forty songs accurately by age one, she was capable of improvising counter-melody by age two, and she taught herself to read at age three. At four, she composed three waltzes for piano during a summer at her grandfather's farm in West Henniker, NH, despite the absence of a piano; instead, she composed the pieces mentally and played them when she returned home. The family struggled to keep up with her musical interests and demands. Her mother sang and played for her, but attempted to prevent young Amy from playing the family piano herself, believing that to indulge the child's wishes in this respect would damage parental authority. Amy often commanded what music was played in the home and how, becoming enraged if it did not meet her standards.  Amy began formal piano lessons with her mother at age six, and soon gave public recitals of works by Handel, Beethoven, and Chopin, as well as her own pieces. One such recital was reviewed in arts journal The Folio, and multiple agents proposed concert tours for the young pianist, which her parents declined - a decision for which Amy was later grateful.  In 1875, the Cheney family moved to Chelsea, a suburb just across the Mystic River from Boston. They were advised there to enroll Amy in a European conservatory, but opted instead for local training, hiring Ernst Perabo and later Carl Baermann (himself a student of Franz Liszt) as piano teachers. In 1881-82, fourteen-year-old Amy also studied harmony and counterpoint with Junius W. Hill. This would be her only formal instruction as a composer, but \\"[s]he collected every book she could find on theory, composition, and orchestration ... she taught herself ... counterpoint, harmony, fugue,\\" even translating Gevaert's and Berlioz's French treatises on orchestration, considered \\"most composers' bibles,\\" into English for herself. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article: 1. Amy Marcy Cheney Beach's exceptional musical abilities as a child prodigy, which included singing 40 songs accurately at the age of one, improvising counter-melodies at the age of two, and teaching herself to read at the age of three. 2. Despite living in a time when women were not commonly recognized in the field of classical music composition, Amy managed to break barriers and become a highly respected and successful composer. Her \\"Gaelic\\" Symphony was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. 3. The strong family history of artistic talent, with Clara Cheney (Amy's mother) being an excellent pianist and singer, and Emma Francis Marcy (Amy's aunt) teaching voice and piano in Boston. 4. The decision by Amy's parents to decline offers for concert tours and European conservatory enrollment for their daughter, choosing instead to provide her with local training. This allowed Amy to develop her skills without the pressure of performing constantly and maintain a relatively normal childhood. 5. Amy's determination and self-study in learning advanced music theory and composition techniques, which included translating and studying French treatises on orchestration by Gevaert and Berlioz. This demonstrated her dedication and passion for music, as well as her independence as a learner. These aspects highlight her prodigious talent, the importance of her family's support, and her determination to succeed as an American woman composer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. Question: Who takes feedback? Options: - not enough information   - people   - writers   - animals === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"The correct answer is: people. People take feedback, both in professional and personal contexts. Feedback could be given to individuals in various roles and capacities - such as employees, students, artists, writers, athletes, and business owners, to name a few. Receiving feedback allows individuals to identify their strengths and weaknesses, learn from their mistakes, and improve their skills and performance in their respective fields. Embracing and utilizing feedback constructively can lead to personal growth, enhanced self-awareness, and increased effectiveness in one's work and relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An Egyptian feast Answer:","output":"Title: Sands of Time Genre: Adventure, Mystery, Drama Plot: Act 1: In modern-day Cairo, Egypt, we are introduced to Jessica Morgan, a young and passionate archaeologist working for a prestigious museum. Jessica has been passionate about ancient Egyptian history since her childhood, which her father, a well-renowned Egyptologist, had greatly inspired. Jessica's father dies in a tragic accident, leaving her a mysterious Ancient Egyptian artifact: an intricately crafted scarab. As she approaches her 30th birthday, Jessica feels a sense of loss and decides to fulfill one of her father's long-held dreams of exploring unchartered territory somewhere in Egypt. Jessica travels to Egypt along with a group of fellow archaeologists and researchers, led by her best friend and fellow Egyptologist, Tom. The group arrives at the Giza Plateau, where they set up camp and begin their research in a recently discovered tomb hidden near the Great Pyramids; they suspect the tomb holds clues to an undiscovered Pharaoh. As her birthday approaches, Jessica feels a strong desire to celebrate it with an ancient Egyptian feast, connecting her passion and her lost father. The group agrees and starts researching Egyptian cuisine, eventually putting together a dinner menu that closely resembles what Pharaohs might have been served in their time. Act 2: At the birthday celebration, the group gathers to toast Jessica's birthday and her father's memory before enjoying the carefully crafted Egyptian feast. The atmosphere is warm and memorable; nostalgia and history weave together under the desert sky. As the celebration continues, Jessica holds the mysterious scarab artifact she inherited from her father. When midnight strikes, a sudden sandstorm hits the campsite, and in the midst of chaos, the scarab starts to glow. Blinded by the sand, Jessica accidentally drops the magical artifact, which lands on the centerpiece of the birthday feast and triggers a powerful energy surge, shattering the scarab in the process. As the storm suddenly subsides, the entire group finds themselves transported back in time to ancient Egypt during the era of the Pharaohs. With the help of a kind-hearted high priest named Nebi, the group learns that they must locate the scattered pieces of the shattered scarab and return it to an ancient hidden temple in order to return to their own time. Act 3: The group sets out on a thrilling quest across ancient Egypt, encountering a series of adventures, puzzles, and mysteries. Along the way, the group uncovers secrets about the tomb they discovered in the present and learns about a powerful and mysterious Pharaoh, Amenhotep, whose legacy was erased from history by jealous successors. As Jessica and her friends race against time, they face various perils, including jealous priests and powerful curses in their quest to find the scarab pieces, while also having to hide their true identities and purposes. During this journey, Jessica becomes increasingly fascinated with Amenhotep's rule as she learns of his noble deeds and benevolent nature. With the help of Nebi, Jessica and her group find the last piece of the scarab and take it to the hidden temple. They successfully complete the ritual to restore the scarab's power, opening a portal to their present time. As they say their heart-wrenching goodbyes to Nebi and ancient Egypt, Jessica feels a deep connection and respect for the ancient culture that inspired her passion in archaeology. She vows to honor Amenhotep's legacy and ensure that this forgotten Pharaoh's true history is restored. Returning to the present, Jessica and her friends continue their Egyptological studies with renewed passion and a deeper understanding of the ancient Egyptian world. In the end, the magical scarab artifact is returned to its rightful place – displayed in the museum as a testament to the Sands of Time and the incredible adventure that connected Jessica to her father's dreams and legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story.

So, we want to move the 1368 to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 1368 from both sides: -72*f = -1368 Now, we have: -72*f = -1368 Finally, we need to divide both sides by -72 to get 'f' by itself: f = -1368 / -72 When we do the division, we get: f = 19 So the solution is f = 19."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Secret Service director Scott Langral, on advice from the President, has Snow convicted of murder and espionage. Snow is sentenced to thirty years on the maximum security space penitentiary MS One, where prisoners are kept in stasis for the length of their sentence. Snow's friend and fellow agent Harry Shaw tries to locate Snow's contact Mace, who knows where Frank's briefcase containing the stolen secrets is hidden. Meanwhile, the President's daughter Emilie arrives on MS One to investigate claims that keeping prisoners in stasis can cause them to develop mental instability. The warden allows her to interview Hydell, a deranged prisoner. He manages to escape and releases all of the prisoners, starting a riot led by his brother Alex. Emilie is shot, and is captured along with others. Shaw convinces Langral and the President to send Snow to rescue Emilie, rather than risk her life in a siege.

What is the world full of? - countries - thought - water - universe - galaxy  The best answer is A:","output":"Our world is full of various elements, from physical features such as water bodies and land masses, to abstract concepts such as thoughts and ideas.  1. Countries: The world is made up of 195 countries, each with its unique culture, traditions, and systems of governance. Each country has its own geography, climate, political structure and economy which contribute to the diversity of our earth. These countries can range from the smallest ones such as Vatican City, to the largest ones like Russia, each having its own history, traditions, and population. Geopolitical borders separate these into sovereign territories. Yet, we are increasingly interconnected through technology, global trade and politics. 2. Thought: The world is also full of thoughts. There are currently over 7.8 billion people on earth, each capable of complex thought and ideation. These minds produce countless ideas and innovations that shape the world. From artworks, scientific innovations, philosophical ideas to political theories, thoughts are what propel human civilization forward. Moreover, it's not just humans that are capable of thought. Research shows that certain animals are also capable of complex cognition and communication.  3. Water: About 71% of the Earth's surface is water-covered, and the oceans hold about 96.5% of all Earth's water. Water also exists in the air as water vapor, in rivers and lakes, in icecaps and glaciers, in the ground as soil moisture and in aquifers. Water is essential for all forms of life and plays a vital role in the proper functioning of Earth's ecosystems. It gives rise to our climates, shapes our landscapes and fuels our ecosystems.  4. Universe: While our world is one planet in our solar system, it is also part of a much larger universe. The universe is full of astronomical bodies including stars, planets, galaxies, and cosmological phenomena. It is unfathomably large, estimated to contain over two trillion galaxies, each one home to billions of stars. The universe is in constant flux, with stars forming and dying, galaxies moving and interacting, and dark energy shaping its large-scale structure. 5. Galaxy: The world is part of the 'Milky Way' Galaxy, which is just one of innumerable galaxies in the universe. Galaxies are enormous systems of stars, planets, gas, dust, and dark matter, bound together by gravity. They come in different shapes and sizes and are scattered throughout the universe. Each galaxy is a world of its own, teeming with celestial phenomena and potential for life. In conclusion, the world is immensely diverse and complex.

Write a summary based on this article: DOHA, Qatar — Now that he is set to become the new emir, the absolute ruler of Qatar, what possibly can Sheik Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani promise to the citizens of a tiny, incredibly rich country that seems to have everything?      In Qatar, the unemployment rate flirts with zero (it is 0.1 percent); infants have a per-capita income over 100,000; health, housing, low interest loans and educations are all provided. Qataris have a world-class television network in Al Jazeera, will host the World Cup in 2022, are building an airport that will eclipse the one in nearby Dubai and hope to soon be self-sufficient in food production.      But they do not have democracy.      Some people here cautiously hope that the surprise decision of the outgoing emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, 61, to hand power to his fourth son, Sheik Tamim, 33, may signal the governing family’s intention to offer Qataris a taste of expanded personal freedoms, even if democracy is not explicitly on the agenda.      There are some hints that already have at least a few Qataris excited. (For most, a beneficent feudal monarchy appears just fine, thanks, and they demonstrated their appreciation by lining up by the thousands, on foot and in their Mercedes and other luxury cars, to visit the two emirs, incoming and outgoing, in their palace on Tuesday and pledge their allegiance.)      Photo      Najeeb al-Nauimi, the lawyer for Qatar’s only political prisoner, Mohammad ibn al-Dheeb al-Ajami, said he was hopeful. His client was jailed for life last year for writing a poem that, in a fairly tame manner, criticized “sheiks playing on their PlayStations.” Mr. Ajami was arrested under a constitutional provision that forbids criticism of the emir, however indirect.      Mr. Nauimi, who said he has known the incoming emir since the sheik was 9 years old, said Tuesday that Sheik Tamim had told him that Mr. Ajami would be released within a few days of the new emir’s accession to power. That does not speak to democracy as much as it does to the absolute power of the monarch, but all the same, Mr. Nauimi hoped it would be a signal of openness to come.      “There will be a lot of changes, definitely,” Mr. Nauimi said.      The outgoing emir already promised parliamentary elections by the end of the year — a constitutional requirement that is long overdue. Mr. Nauimi is among those agitating for amendments to the Constitution that would let that Parliament appoint the prime minister, paving the way for a constitutional monarchy inching closer to the British model and away from the autocratic style of the Persian Gulf states.      It would be the first such example in any of the gulf’s monarchies, and one of the few in the Arab world.      “I’m optimistic,” Mr. Nauimi said.      Optimistic, but not absolutely sure — in part because the governing family has consistently demonstrated that it has no tolerance to being challenged, or even criticized indirectly. In the absence of any sort of public agitation, change will come from the top down, not from the bottom up.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “I just don’t believe the people who say there won’t be any changes,” he said, offering what may be a case of wishful thinking.      But what can the new emir change?      Many analysts say that Qatar’s aggressive interventionist foreign policy has become too integral a part of its national character to be rolled back. The betting is that the new foreign minister — expected to be appointed on Thursday with a new cabinet — will be promoted from within. Some here believe it may be Khalid al-Attiyah, the deputy foreign minister, who is close to the emir and a supporter of his many international ventures.      “I think you’ll see some very big gestures from Sheik Tamim,” said John Watts, who works here for BLJ Worldwide, a well-paid consulting firm that acts as strategic adviser to the royal family and the Qatari government. The release of Mr. Ajami, the imprisoned poet? “That may well be one of them.”      “I haven’t heard anything specific about his policy agenda, but that would fit into his nature and character,” Mr. Watts said.      The outgoing emir himself seemed to be priming the pump for change in a televised address to the nation at 8 a.m. on Tuesday. (Oddly, because in the heat of summer few Qataris are actually awake that early).      “The time has come to turn a new leaf in the history of our nation, where a new generation steps forward to shoulder the responsibility with their dynamic potential and creative thoughts,” the emir said.      That of course could mean anything — or everything.      One official close to the royal family said that the new cabinet would include at least one woman, and possibly two — a first here, and a rarity in the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf.      “This is hugely exciting,” said Mike Holtzman, the president of BLJ Worldwide. While it is unusual in the region for a ruler to voluntarily step down, he said, “to those who follow Qatar, it is very much in keeping; they have invested heavily in their young people.”      The incoming emir is an enigma, even to his own people, because until now his role has been in the background. “I don’t think Tamim and his father are far apart, philosophically,” said one former diplomat who has served in Qatar and who spoke anonymously in keeping with protocol. “But he’s done a good job of playing his cards close to his chest.”      That has led to a school of thought here that he is socially conservative — none of his own three wives have anything like the high political profile role enjoyed by his mother, Sheika Mozah.      “It’s just not true” that he is socially conservative, Mr. Holtzman said. For years, he was in the wings as his father and his prime minister ran the country, so people had little basis on which to judge him.      “Now that he’s got the reigns, he’ll be showing concern for human rights, worker safety,” he said. “He has the wind at his back.”      And democracy?      “Well, Qatar is already a very open society.” ||||| Background on Tuesday's leadership transition in Qatar from the 61-year-old emir to his 33-year-old son, Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

Qatar's ruler said Tuesday he has... (Associated Press)      ___      WHY IS QATAR IMPORTANT?      The Gulf state of Qatar is small _ only about a third the size of Belgium _ but has a carved out a significant global profile in the past decade.      Qatar has huge oil and gas riches that feed one of the world's largest and most acquisition-hungry sovereign wealth funds, estimated at more than 100 billion. Its holdings have included stakes in London's capital's Harrods department store, the French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and soccer's Paris Saint-Germain. Qatar also has pledged billions of dollars to help businesses in debt-crippled Greece and Italy.      Qatar's political aims are equally ambitious. It has served as mediator for peace efforts in Sudan's Darfur region and among rival Palestinian political factions. It is currently hosting envoys from Afghanistan's Taliban for possible U.S.-led talks seeking to stabilize the country before the American troop withdrawal next year. Qatar has played a central role in the Arab Spring by providing critical aid for Libyan rebels last year and now a leading backer of Syria's opposition.      Qatar's government founded the television network Al Jazeera in 1996, which transformed news broadcasting in the Arab-speaking world. The state-run Qatar Airways is among the world's fastest-growing carriers.      IS SUCH A TRANSITION UNUSUAL?      It is exceedingly rare among the ruling Gulf Arab dynasties. Most leaders remain for life or have been pushed out in palace coups. Qatar's outgoing emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, took control in a bloodless coup against his father in 1995.      The change in Qatar was believed to be prompted by health problems with the 61-year-old Sheik Hamad, but Qatar officials have not publicly disclosed any details.      Yet it reinforces Qatar's bold political style. The transition to the 33-year-old crown prince, Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, appears a direct response to the Arab Spring demands for reforms and its emphasis on giving a stronger political voice to the region's youth.      It also upends the ruling hierarchy among neighboring Gulf allies dominated by old guard leaders such as the 90-year-old King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait's 84-year-old emir, Sheik Sabah Al Ahmed Al Sabah.      WHAT CHANGES CAN BE EXPECTED?      Not many in the short term. The outgoing emir is expected to maintain a guiding hand over Qatar's affairs for years to come. His son also has been involved in most key decisions in recent years as part of the grooming process.      The most noticeable changes will likely be among the top government posts. It's expected that Qatar's long-serving prime minister and others could be replaced as Sheik Tamim puts together his own inner circle.      Another possible new element could be more social media interaction. The British-educated Sheik Tamim was still a teenager when the Internet age began and is well attuned to its influence.      Sheik Tamim also headed up Doha's unsuccessful attempt for the 2020 Olympics. He could give a boost to a possible return bid for the 2024 Games. ||||| Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the ruler of Qatar for 18 years, has transferred the \\"reins of power\\" to his son.      The outgoing emir made the announcement to hand over power to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, 33, in an address to the nation on Tuesday.      \\"I declare that I will hand over the reins of power to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and I am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission,\\" Sheikh Hamad, 61, said.      Live television footage after the speech finished showed Sheikh Hamad and his son smiling widely, being greeted with traditional embraces by dignitaries and prominent members of the Qatari society.      Sheikh Hamad had met royals a day earlier, where he announced the transition plans after weeks of speculation of his abdication.      \\"God Almighty is aware that I had not desired power for the sake of power, nor endeavoured to rule for personal motives,\\" the outgoing emir said. \\"It has always been the nation’s interest ... that we lead through a new chapter.\\"      Sheikh Tamim has been groomed for the position since 2003, when his elder brother stepped aside.      In the speech, Sheikh Hamad also called on the people of Qatar to protect their identity.      \\"I am confidant that you are fully aware of your loyalty and of your Arab and Muslim identity,\\" he said. \\"I urge you to preserve our civilised traditional and cultural values, originating from our religion, Arab identity and above all our humanity; as we believe that the Arab World is one human body; one coherent structure; it prospers if all its parts are prosperous.\\"      Saudi Arabia was quick to offer congratulations to Sheikh Tamim, who is expected to address the Shura Council, an advisory assembly, on Wednesday in Doha.      The kingdom's 90-year-old King Abdullah said: \\"We are confident that you will continue the journey of your father ... and his efforts in serving the state of Qatar and its brotherly people as well as strengthening relations between the two nations.\\"      The UAE followed, with President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, 65, affirming the \\"deepness of the brotherly relations,\\" in a statement carried by state media.      British Foreign Secretary William Hague thanked Sheikh Hamad for friendship and support, and tweeted that Tuesday symbolised an \\"Historic day for Qatar as the new generation takes over.\\"      Handover process      Al Jazeera's diplomatic editor, James Bays, said the next 48 hours would be crucial for the new leader.      \\"The way this works is that he needs to see his subjects,\\" he said. \\"He needs to speak to prominent players in society, and there will effectively be, for some hours today, and some hours on Wednesday, an open house here where he will be meeting all the prominent sheikhs, speaking to them, discussing the future.\\"      Sheikh Hamad took power in 1995 while his father was on an overseas trip.      Since then Qatar's economy has grown significantly.      That growth came largely from natural gas; Qatar possesses some of the largest proven reserves in the world, but produced almost nothing before 1995.      He became the ruler of a country with an 8bn economy, a figure which grew to 174bn a decade and half later.      During most of Sheikh Hamad's rule, Qatar also adopted a pragmatic policy, cultivating relationships with countries and groups across the political spectrum.      \\"We also know when you speak to diplomats here that [Sheikh Tamim] has been involved very closely with Qatari policy, both domestic and foreign policy for some considerable time,\\" Al Jazeera's Bays said. \\"Slowly he's been taking more and more of a share of the running of this country.      It's not as though he is now going to be sitting at a new desk with a new brief. He has been taking control of many matters, both in terms of their domestic and international policy.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"In the country of Qatar, there is a new leader called Sheik Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. The people who live there are very rich and they will host the World Cup in 2022. But they do not have democracy. Democracy is when people can vote for their leaders and have a say in the decisions the country makes. Some people hope that the new leader will give them more freedom and might make Qatar a little more like a democracy. The old leader also promised that they would have elections soon. This would be a big change for Qatar and it could be an example for other countries in the area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The body is discovered locked in a storage locker by the owner: the recently widowed Countess Christina Como (Eva Bartok), which is managed by Massimo Morlacchi (Cameron Mitchell). Inspector Silvestri (Thomas Reiner), an arrogant police detective, arrives to take charge of the murder investigation. Silvestri soon discovers that the fashion house is a hotbed to drugs, corruption, and blackmail. The suspects include Massimo, the wealthy Ricardo Morellin (Frnaco Ressel), who was having an affair with Isabella, the dress designer Cesar Lazzarini (Louis Pigot), and Isabella's boyfriend Frank (Dante Di Paolo) an antique shop owner who sold cocaine to some of the models on a daily basis, as well as the handyman Marco (Massimo Righi).The following evening during a fashion show, when it is discovered that Isabella kept a diary which detailed most of the indiscretions, everyone is thrown into a quandary. Initially, the diary falls into the hands of Nicole (Ariana Gorini), one of the models, who promises to take it to the police. But another model, named Peggy (Mary Arden), manages to obtain it unnoticed. Later that night, Nicole goes to visit Frank at his antique shop. While there, she is terrorized by strange sounds and fleeting shadows. Before she can escape, she is attacked and killed by the same mysterious figure dressed in black who whacks her in the face with a clawed antique mallet.

Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of sorts. Minus the fangs, of course. They're dark, bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. Through their charms (namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) they seduce desperate souls, who they proceed to torment and victimize. That's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. It's not a blend of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy, main character. I did enjoy, however, the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks. I was very impressed by the cast's strong acting, particularly David Thelis's; only the character of Jeremy seemed too bi-dimensional. The photography and the music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together.  What really turns me off about \\"Naked\\" (and the main reason I'd never recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one's angst. In other words, in a world that sucks so bad, what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls, right? To suggest (as some have on this website) that Johnny is not so unkind a person because he's not as rough on girls as Jeremy, seems completely absurd to me. They're both terrible, nasty people. And they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance. One could argue that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass. But still, his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter. And I could be wrong, but I'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review mostly thought negatively of the movie.

Please briefly summarize this news article: ‘Who’s Miranda?’ Suspect in Kayak Killing Didn’t Understand Her Rights, Lawyer Says GOSHEN, N.Y. — Angelika Graswald, the woman accused of killing her fiancé while on a kayak outing last year, asked an investigator who “Miranda” was — a few hours after she had been read her Miranda rights, according to testimony in a pretrial hearing here on Tuesday. In his cross-examination of the investigator, Ms. Graswald’s lawyer, Richard A. Portale, sought to show that his client, a native of Latvia, did not grasp the implications of the 11-hour police interrogation that preceded her arrest on second-degree-murder charges. “My client,” Mr. Portale said in court, “is asking, ‘What’s Miranda? Who’s Miranda?’” The investigator, Donald DeQuarto, responded that he felt confident that earlier in the police interrogation, Ms. Graswald had comprehended her rights. “I asked her if she understood it, and she stated yes,” Mr. DeQuarto said. “I remember her reading the piece of paper and writing it onto a piece of paper, the Miranda warning.” During the interrogation, Ms. Graswald admitted to removing the drain plug of the kayak that belonged to her fiancé, Vincent Viafore, and also tampering with his paddle. Mr. Viafore, 46, drowned on April 19, 2015, when his kayak capsized in rough water on the Hudson River. The Miranda warning is usually read to suspects at the start of a police interrogation. It alerts them to their right to remain silent and to obtain a lawyer, and is intended to preserve the admissibility of evidence at trial. The Miranda rights get their name from a case involving Ernesto Arturo Miranda, a laborer whose confession led to his conviction for armed robbery, kidnapping and rape. His appeal resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1966 that said suspects must be informed of their right to legal representation and against self-incrimination. The purpose of the pretrial hearing is to determine how investigators obtained their evidence. In the case against Ms. Graswald, 36, the case hinges largely on statements she made to the police, including the videotaped interrogation that Mr. Portale is trying to keep out of the trial. During the hearing, Mr. DeQuarto said that he had read Ms. Graswald her Miranda rights only after they had spoken for more than three hours at the police barracks in Orange County. The questioning came 10 days after Mr. Viafore’s kayak had capsized in the river; an autopsy report ruled the cause of death a drowning and the manner of death homicide, citing the “kayak drain plug intentionally removed by other.” Prosecutors say that Ms. Graswald was motivated by Mr. Viafore’s life insurance policy; she stood to collect 250,000 in benefits. The long interrogation followed an encounter earlier in the day between Ms. Graswald and the police on Bannerman Island, where the couple, who lived together in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., had rested the day he capsized. On the island, Ms. Graswald, who was laying a memorial wreath, had told Mr. DeQuarto that she felt “trapped” in the relationship and confessed to sabotaging his kayak, he said in earlier testimony. But Mr. Portale said the video of the 11-hour interrogation shows that around the seventh hour, Ms. Graswald appears not to have understood her rights, inquiring about “Miranda” as though it might be a person. In another strange detail in a case full of them, Mr. DeQuarto testified that Ms. Graswald suggested she was pregnant at the time of Mr. Viafore’s death. “Two hours in, she asks to use the bathroom,” Mr. Portale said to Mr. DeQuarto. “She comes back and she relates to you that maybe she just had a miscarriage. Do you remember that?” Mr. DeQuarto said he did remember. In other testimony, Susan McCardell, a volunteer gardener at Bannerman Island, said she saw Ms. Graswald in distress when she was with the officers on the island last spring. Investigators have testified that Ms. Graswald, who also volunteered on the island, seemed agitated. “They were bullying her; she was crying,” Ms. McCardell said. “It was obvious to anyone it was not a good situation. She was unhappy, she was crying, she did not want to be alone.” But she said Ms. Graswald indicated that Ms. McCardell should not stay. So did the officers, she testified. Ms. McCardell said one of the investigators told her: “She doesn’t really need you. She’s OK.” Ms. McCardell said she returned a second time, about a half-hour later, and found Ms. Graswald still in tears. “She was still crying. She was a little more agitated,” Ms. McCardell said. “I said: ‘Do you want me to stay? I think I should be here with you.’” Her testimony contrasts with that of the investigators, who testified that while Ms. Graswald was agitated on the island, she seemed “happy-go-lucky” on the boat ride back to Police Headquarters. Ms. Graswald’s English skills could prove crucial to whether jurors are allowed to view the taped police interrogation. (A decision is expected in late July.) A native Russian speaker, Ms. Graswald arrived in the United States as an au pair more than 15 years ago. Mr. Portale has portrayed Ms. Graswald as struggling with English, but during the police investigation she demonstrated a sophisticated grasp of the language. In a video clip of the interrogation shown last fall on ABC’s “20/20,” a detective asked: “When you watched him in the water, was a part of you saying, ‘My worries are going away now?’ Were you almost ...” He paused, but she filled in the word, offering “euphoric.” The detective said, “Euphoric that he was gone — you felt that way?” She answered, “I still do.” Nate Schweber reported from Goshen, and Lisa W. Foderaro from New York.
