Here's a comprehensive guide on how to navigate these aspects: # Lane Position - **Riding Direction:** Always ride in the same direction as traffic. This makes you more predictable to motorists. - **Right Side of the Lane:** Generally, bicyclists should ride as close to the right side of the road as practicable. However, there are exceptions, such as when avoiding road hazards, moving at the speed of traffic, or if the lane is too narrow for a bicycle and a vehicle to share side by side safely. - **Taking the Lane:** In situations where the lane is too narrow for vehicles and bicycles to safely share side by side, or when preparing to make left-hand turns, it's appropriate for cyclists to \\"take the lane\\" by positioning themselves in the center of the lane. This practice is legal and recommended to prevent close passing and increase visibility. # Changing Lanes - **Check and Signal:** Always look over your shoulder to check for traffic before changing lanes and signal your intentions early to give motorists notice. Using hand signals, extend your left arm out for a left turn or upward at a 90-degree angle for a right turn. - **Proceed When Safe:** After signaling and ensuring the lane is clear, smoothly move into the lane. Continually be aware of traffic flow and adjust your speed and positioning as necessary. # Making Left and Right Turns - **Left Turns:** There are a couple of methods for making left turns: - **Like a Car:** Signal your turn, move into the left turn lane or the left side of the lane when there is no turn lane, check for oncoming traffic, and proceed when it's safe. Position yourself so that cars turning the same direction cannot pass and potentially cut you off. - **Box Turn:** Stay on the right, cross the intersection as if you were going straight, stop, dismount if necessary, then reposition yourself in the new direction and proceed if traffic signals permit. - **Right Turns:** Stay on the right side of the road, signal your intention to turn right, check over your shoulder for traffic, and turn when it's safe. Be mindful of vehicles that might be attempting to pass as you slow down to make the turn. # Riding Through Intersections - **Stay Visible:** Position yourself in the lane where drivers expect traffic to be, avoiding blind spots. - **Eye Contact:** Try to make eye contact with drivers at intersections to ensure they've seen you. - **Follow Traffic Signals:** Obey all traffic lights and signs just as cars are required to do. - **Yield to Pedestrians:** Always yield to pedestrians in crosswalks. - **Right of Way:** Follow standard right-of-way rules. If you arrive at a stop sign at the same time as a car, the rule is the first to stop is the first to go. If in doubt, yield to avoid confusion. - **Scan:** Continually scan the intersection for turning vehicles, ensuring drivers see you before you cross their path. # General Tips - Be Predictable: Use hand signals and make your intentions clear to others on the road. - Lights and Reflectors: Use front and back lights, and reflective clothing, especially in low-light conditions. - Stay Alert: Keep an eye out for vehicles entering or exiting driveways, as well as parked cars that might suddenly open doors. - Follow the Law: Know and abide by local traffic laws as they apply to bicyclists. By understanding and practicing these guidelines, cyclists can significantly improve their safety and the safety of others while navigating roads and streets."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this info so that it flows together. # Riding Position and Use of Lanes - Right Side of the Road and “Taking the Lane”: Bicyclists must ride as close to the right side of the road as safely possible but can “take the lane” under specific conditions such as avoiding hazards or if the lane is too narrow to share. This law recognizes the safety needs of cyclists but may not be widely understood, leading to conflicts. - Bicycle Lanes and Separated Bikeways: Cyclists slower than traffic are required to use the bike lane where present. However, cyclists are not mandated to use protected bike lanes (separated bikeways) and may choose to ride outside of them. - Riding with Traffic: Bicyclists are required to ride in the same direction as vehicular traffic, enhancing visibility and predictability on the road. # Specific Types of Bikes - Electric and Motorized Bicycles: The use of mopeds and high-speed electric bikes (Type 3) is restricted on trails, paths, and lanes unless permitted by local authorities. Helmets are mandatory, and there are age restrictions. Type 1 and 2 electric bikes are more permissively used, similar to regular bicycles. # Equipment Requirements - Brakes, Handlebars, and Bicycle Size: Bicycles must have functioning brakes, appropriately sized handlebars, and must be the right size for the rider. - Lights and Reflectors: At night, bicycles need to be equipped with visible lights and reflectors to ensure safety through visibility to others. - Helmets: Riders under the age of 18 are required to wear helmets, a regulation aimed at reducing head injuries. # Conduct - Sidewalk Riding, Alcohol, and Electronic Devices: Riding on sidewalks is governed by local laws. Riding under the influence and hitching rides are prohibited. While cyclists can use handheld cell phones, it is advised to do so with caution. - Signaling and Right of Way: Cyclists must use hand signals when turning or stopping and obey traffic signals. They must yield to pedestrians and be prepared to stop for vehicles under certain conditions. # Infrastructure Interactions - Bicycle Path Use: Stopping or parking on a bike path is prohibited, ensuring clear paths for all users. - Intersection Behavior: Cyclists must negotiate intersections with care, using designated lanes for turns, and respecting pedestrian crossings. # Safety Precautions - Inspection and Adjustment: Regular bike inspections and adjustments ensure the bicycle is in good working condition, providing a safe riding experience. - Helmets and Visibility: Properly fitted helmets must be worn by riders under 18, and all cyclists should enhance their visibility with reflective gear and lights. - Awareness and Anticipation: Cyclists must remain vigilant, anticipate the actions of others, and position themselves safely on the road, especially near parked cars and within intersections. # Similarities - Direction of Travel: Both bicyclists and motor vehicle drivers are required to travel in the same direction as traffic on the right side of the road. This promotes predictability and reduces the risk of head-on collisions. - Signaling: Both groups are expected to signal their intentions to turn or stop, fostering clear communication among road users. - Obeying Traffic Signals: Traffic lights and stop signs must be obeyed by both bicyclists and motorists, ensuring orderly flow and reducing the risk of accidents at intersections. - Yielding to Pedestrians: Both are required to yield the right-of-way to pedestrians, especially in crosswalks, prioritizing pedestrian safety. - Alcohol and Drugs: Operating either a bicycle or a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs is illegal, acknowledging the impaired judgment and increased risk of accidents it brings. # Differences - Lane Usage: While motor vehicles are expected to use lanes designated for cars, bicycles are often provided with specific bike lanes or paths. Bicyclists may “take the lane” under certain conditions for safety, a concept that doesn’t apply to motor vehicles. - Sidewalk Riding: In many areas, bicycles are allowed on sidewalks (though often regulated by local ordnance), whereas motor vehicles are not. - Equipment Requirements: While both bicycles and vehicles have equipment laws (lights, brakes), bicycles have specific requirements like helmet laws for riders under 18, the need for reflectors, and rules about handlebar height that do not apply to motor vehicles. - Speed: Bicycles, being much slower than motor vehicles, come with laws that permit riders to use the rightmost side of the road or specially designated lanes to not impede the flow of faster traffic. - Freeways and Toll Roads: Bicycles are typically prohibited on freeways and toll roads, which are designed exclusively for motor vehicles due to safety concerns related to speed and traffic volume. - Parking: While motor vehicles are restricted to parking spaces and lots, bicycles have more flexibility, often using racks and poles, but must not obstruct pedestrian paths. - Electronic Devices: The use of handheld electronic devices while operating a vehicle is generally restricted, while cyclists may have more leniency, though distracted riding is equally discouraged. - Passenger Requirements: Specific laws apply to carrying passengers on bicycles (such as requiring a permanent seat for passengers) that differ from those for motor vehicles. # Lane Position - Riding Direction: Always ride in the same direction as traffic. This makes you more predictable to motorists. - Right Side of the Lane: Generally, bicyclists should ride as close to the right side of the road as practicable. However, there are exceptions, such as when avoiding road hazards, moving at the speed of traffic, or if the lane is too narrow for a bicycle and a vehicle to share side by side safely. - Taking the Lane: In situations where the lane is too narrow for vehicles and bicycles to safely share side by side, or when preparing to make left-hand turns, it’s appropriate for cyclists to “take the lane” by positioning themselves in the center of the lane.

However, there are circumstances such as avoiding road hazards, laneways too narrow to share with a vehicle, or when moving at the same speed as traffic, where taking the center of the lane (\\"taking the lane\\") is both legal and advised. This action prevents close passing by vehicles and increases cyclist visibility. Although cyclists slower than traffic are generally required to use bike lanes where available, they are not obligated to use protected bike lanes (separated bikeways) and may opt to ride outside them to ensure safety. Importantly, always ride in the same direction as vehicular traffic to increase visibility and predictability on the road. # Equipment and Conduct Bicycles must be equipped with functioning brakes, appropriately sized handlebars, and be a proper fit for the rider. Night-time visibility through lights and reflectors is crucial for safety, and riders under the age of 18 are required to wear helmets. While riding on sidewalks is subject to local laws, and riding under the influence is prohibited, cyclists can use handheld cell phones, though caution is advised. Signaling intentions before turning or stopping and yielding to pedestrians are key aspects of safe cycling conduct. # Interaction with Infrastructure Bicycles are not to be stopped or parked on bike paths to maintain clear paths for users. At intersections, cyclists should position themselves visibly, make eye contact with drivers, and follow all traffic signals, similar to motor vehicle requirements. Regular bike inspections ensure the bicycle remains in safe working condition. # Similarities and Differences with Motor Vehicle Laws Bicyclists share many basic road rules with motor vehicles, such as traveling in the same direction as traffic, obeying traffic signals, and yielding to pedestrians. However, bikes are typically not allowed on freeways and have different requirements for lane usage, equipment, and parking. For instance, bicycles may be allowed on sidewalks where motor vehicles are not, and specific equipment like helmets and reflectors are mandated for bicycles, reflecting their unique safety needs. # Changing Lanes and Making Turns When changing lanes or intending to turn, always signal early with hand signals to notify motorists of your intended direction change. Check over your shoulder to ensure the lane is clear before moving. There are specific strategies for making left turns, including the traditional vehicular method, where you position yourself in the turning lane, and the \\"box turn,\\" which may be safer in high-traffic areas. Right turns should be made from the right side of the road, after signaling and ensuring it's safe to proceed. # Navigating Intersections Staying visible and alert at intersections is key. Position your bicycle where drivers expect to see traffic, make eye contact to confirm visibility, and obey all traffic signals. Yielding to pedestrians and adhering to right-of-way rules minimizes conflicts and enhances safety for all road users. Understanding and applying these guidelines ensures a safer, more enjoyable cycling experience on roads and streets, matched with compliance with specific bicycle laws that enhance coexistence with motor vehicles."},{"instruction":"Describe rogue gas giant with clouds of soots","output":"A rogue gas giant with clouds of soot represents an intriguing and exotic type of astronomical object. To break this down: # Rogue Gas Giant A \\"rogue\\" gas giant is a planet that has been ejected from its original solar system, wandering through space without orbiting a star. This ejection could happen due to gravitational disturbances, typically caused by interactions with other planets in the system or a passing celestial body, such as a star or another rogue planet. As a result, these planets drift through the galaxy as interstellar travelers, not bound to any sun. # Clouds of Soot The mention of clouds of soots (or soot) is a description of the planet's atmosphere. Soot is a carbon-based compound that, on Earth, results from partial combustion of organic materials, creating fine particles. In the context of a rogue gas giant, \\"clouds of soot\\" would imply a thick, dark layer of carbon-rich particles suspended in the planet's atmosphere. The presence of soot-like particles could be the result of various atmospheric processes: 1. **Chemical Reactions:** In the planet's past, while it was still within its star system, intense heat and pressure could have driven chemical reactions that generated complex hydrocarbon molecules or carbon particles, which now populate the upper atmosphere. 2. **Atmospheric Composition:** The planet might have an atmosphere rich in hydrocarbons like methane or ethane. Ultraviolet radiation from its former star, or radioactive decay within the planet itself, could have broken these molecules down into smaller hydrocarbons and eventually into carbon particles, similar to soot. 3. **Interstellar Medium Interactions:** As the rogue planet travels through space, it could encounter clouds of interstellar dust, including carbon-rich particles. Some of these particles could get captured by the planet's gravity and enrich its atmosphere with soot-like substances. # Appearance and Implications A rogue gas giant with clouds of soot would likely appear as a truly dark and shadowy world, with its thick, sooty clouds absorbing most of the light that hits them. This absorption could lead to an effective loss of any reflective signature, making the planet exceedingly difficult to detect against the backdrop of space. These clouds might also affect the planet's thermal characteristics. Soot has high thermal absorption properties, which could lead to an interesting thermal profile for the planet, potentially retaining heat within the atmosphere. However, without a nearby star, the overall temperature of the planet would likely be extremely cold, particularly if it relies solely on residual heat from its formation or minimal geothermal activity. The study of such a rogue gas giant would offer valuable insights into planetary formation, atmospheric chemistry, and the dynamics of planetary systems, providing a richer understanding of the diversity of objects in our universe."},{"instruction":"what gender has multiple pronouns?

Discuss what is the same and what is different from laws applying to motor vehicles. Explain where and how you should ride on roads and streets to include lane position, changing lanes, making left and right turns, and riding through intersections. I live in San Ramon, California.","output":"In San Ramon, California, cyclists are subject to the California Vehicle Code (CVC), which outlines the laws pertaining to bicycles on public roads. There are similarities and differences between the laws that apply to bicycles and those that apply to motor vehicles. It is important to understand these distinctions, as well as the correct practices for riding in traffic, to ensure both safety and legality. # Similarities with Motor Vehicle Laws: 1. **Traffic Signals and Signs**: Cyclists must obey all traffic signals and signs just like motor vehicle drivers. This includes stopping at stop signs and red lights, and following the rules at yield signs and other road markings (CVC 21200). 2. **Riding Under the Influence**: It's illegal to ride a bicycle on public roads under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or both. The CVC treats riding a bicycle while impaired similarly to driving a motor vehicle while impaired, although the penalties may differ (CVC 21200.5). 3. **Right-of-Way**: Bicyclists must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within marked crosswalks or at intersections, similar to the requirements for drivers of motor vehicles. # Differences from Motor Vehicle Laws: 1. **Helmet Laws**: While motor vehicle occupants are not required to wear helmets, anyone under the age of 18 riding a bicycle must wear a bicycle helmet that meets specified safety standards (CVC 21212). 2. **Lane Positioning**: Bicycles are generally required to ride as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway except when passing, preparing for a left turn, avoiding hazards, or if the lane is too narrow to share side by side with a motor vehicle (CVC 21202). This is different from motor vehicles, which can use the full lane. 3. **Sidewalk Riding**: The CVC does not prohibit riding bicycles on sidewalks, but local ordinances can. In San Ramon, it's essential to check local laws as they can vary substantially depending on the jurisdiction. # Riding Practices: - **Lane Position**: When riding on roads, cyclists should use the rightmost lane that goes in their direction. If the road has a bike lane, cyclists are encouraged to use it, though they are not strictly bound to it unless local law states otherwise. - **Changing Lanes and Turning**: Like motor vehicles, cyclists should signal their intentions when changing lanes or making turns (left arm outstretched for left turns/right turns, up for right turns if using the alternative signal, and down to stop or decrease speed). Checking over the shoulder for traffic and signaling ahead of a turn or lane change is crucial. - **Riding Through Intersections**: Cyclists should stay on the right side of the rightmost lane when going straight through an intersection. If making a left turn, they should signal and move into the left or turn lane well before the intersection, just like a car would. # Important Considerations: - **Bike Lanes and Paths**: When available and not hazardous, it's often safer and more convenient to use designated bike lanes or paths. - **Passing and Being Passed**: Cyclists have the right to take the full lane when necessary for safety, but should move to the right to allow faster traffic to pass when it is safe to do so. Understanding and adhering to these state and local laws is essential for the safety of cyclists and other road users in San Ramon, California. Regardless of the legal requirements, cyclists should always ride defensively and assume that they may not be seen by drivers."},{"instruction":"add these laws as well, If you’re moving as fast as traffic, you can ride wherever you want. If you’re moving slower than traffic, you can “take the lane” if it’s not wide enough for a bike and a vehicle to safely share side-by-side. The law says that people who ride bikes must ride as close to the right side of the road as practicable except under the following conditions: when passing, preparing for a left turn, avoiding hazards, if the lane is too narrow to share, or if approaching a place where a right turn is authorized. (VEH 21202) Unfortunately, some motorists and even police don’t understand cyclists’ right to “take the lane.” If you have a legal problem based on this understanding, consider calling one of the bike-friendly lawyers we identify under Legal Resources below. Use the bicycle lane. On a roadway with a bike lane, bicyclists traveling slower than traffic must use the bike lane except when making a left turn, passing, avoiding hazardous conditions, or approaching a place where a right turn is authorized. VEH 21208 You don’t have to use the “protected bike lane.” Once a bike lane is separated from moving traffic bywith posts or car parking or anything else, it’s no longer a “bike lane” according to the law; it’s a “separated bikeway.” In this case, VEH 21208 does not apply. You may ride outside of the separated bikeway for any reason. (SHC 890.4d) Ride with traffic. Bicyclists must travel on the right side of the roadway in the direction of traffic, except when passing, making a legal left turn, riding on a one-way street, riding on a road that is too narrow, or when the right side of the road is closed due to road construction.

VEH 21201(a) Handlebars: Handlebars must not place the hands higher than the rider’s shoulders. VEH 21201(b) Bicycle size: Bicycles must be small and/or large enough for the rider to stop, support the bicycle with one foot on the ground, and start safely. VEH 21201(c) Lights and Reflectors: At night, the following must be attached to the bicycle or bicyclist: a white headlight visible from the front a red reflector or a red light with a built in reflector (can be solid of flashing) visible from the rear a white or yellow reflector on each pedal or on the bicyclist’s shoes or ankles that is visible from the front and the rear a white or yellow reflector on the front half of the bicycle, and a red or white reflector on each side of the back half of the bicycle. These reflectors are not required if the bike has reflectorized front and back tires. VEH 21201(d) #1-4 and VEH 21201(e) Although not required, some cyclists like to use flashing front and rear lights during the day to make themselves more visible to vehicles Seats: All riders must have a permanent, regular seat unless the bicycle is designed by the manufacturer to be ridden without a seat. Bicycle passengers weighing less than 40 lbs. must have a seat that retains them in place and protects them from moving parts. VEH 21204 Helmets: Bicyclists and bicycle passengers under the age of 18 must wear an approved helmet when riding on a bicycle. VEH 21212 Headphones: Bicyclists may not wear earplugs in both ears or a headset covering both ears. Hearing aids are allowed.

Although not legally required for those 18 and older, helmets are strongly recommended for all cyclists (VEH 21212). - **Lights and Reflectors**: At night, bicycles must be equipped with a white headlight visible from the front, a red reflector or red light visible from the rear, and reflective materials or lights on the rider and/or the bike (VEH 21201(d) and (e)). - **Brakes**: Bicycles must have a brake that enables the bike to skid on dry, level pavement (VEH 21201(a)). - **Handlebars and Seats**: Handlebars must not be higher than the rider's shoulders. Bicycles must be of an appropriate size for the rider (VEH 21201(b) and (c)). # Additional Rules: - **Cell Phones**: Unlike drivers of motor vehicles, cyclists can use a handheld cell phone while riding. However, doing so can be dangerous (VEH 23123). - **Alcohol and Drugs**: Riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs is prohibited (VEH 21200.5). - **Sidewalks and Bike Paths**: Rules for riding on sidewalks vary by locality within California. Bicyclists may not obstruct bike paths (VEH 21211). - **Freeways and Toll Bridges**: Bicycles are not allowed on most freeways and toll bridges unless signage permits (VEH 21960, VEH 23330). # Interacting with Pedestrians and Vehicles: - **Yielding to Pedestrians**: Cyclists must yield to pedestrians in both marked and unmarked crosswalks and to visually impaired pedestrians with a white cane or guide dog (VEH 21950, VEH 21963). - **Parking**: Bicycles should not be left in a way that obstructs pedestrian paths (VEH 21210). # High-speed Electric Bikes and Mopeds: - **Use Restrictions**: Type 3 electric bicycles and gas-powered bikes have specific rules prohibiting their use on certain paths and require helmets and an age minimum of 16 for operation. Conversely, Type 1 and 2 electric bikes are more permissive in where they can be ridden (VEH 21207.5, VEH 21213). Understanding and following these laws ensure not just legal compliance but also promote safety for cyclists and all road users in San Ramon and across California. Cyclists should always ride defensively and be prepared for situations where others may not fully understand or observe these laws."},{"instruction":"Discuss these laws and Describe state and local laws concerning bicycles. Discuss what is the same and what is different from laws applying to motor vehicles. Explain where and how you should ride on roads and streets to include lane position, changing lanes, making left and right turns, and riding through intersections. If you’re moving as fast as traffic, you can ride wherever you want. If you’re moving slower than traffic, you can “take the lane” if it’s not wide enough for a bike and a vehicle to safely share side-by-side. The law says that people who ride bikes must ride as close to the right side of the road as practicable except under the following conditions: when passing, preparing for a left turn, avoiding hazards, if the lane is too narrow to share, or if approaching a place where a right turn is authorized. (VEH 21202) Unfortunately, some motorists and even police don’t understand cyclists’ right to “take the lane.” If you have a legal problem based on this understanding, consider calling one of the bike-friendly lawyers we identify under Legal Resources below. Use the bicycle lane. On a roadway with a bike lane, bicyclists traveling slower than traffic must use the bike lane except when making a left turn, passing, avoiding hazardous conditions, or approaching a place where a right turn is authorized. VEH 21208 You don’t have to use the “protected bike lane.” Once a bike lane is separated from moving traffic bywith posts or car parking or anything else, it’s no longer a “bike lane” according to the law; it’s a “separated bikeway.” In this case, VEH 21208 does not apply. You may ride outside of the separated bikeway for any reason. (SHC 890.4d) Ride with traffic. Bicyclists must travel on the right side of the roadway in the direction of traffic, except when passing, making a legal left turn, riding on a one-way street, riding on a road that is too narrow, or when the right side of the road is closed due to road construction. VEH 21650 Mopeds and high-speed electric bikes are not like regular bikes. Gas-powered bicycles and type 3 electric bicycles (with top assisted speeds of 28 mph) may not be used on trails, bike paths, or bike lanes unless allowed by local authorities. They may be used in bike lanes or separated bikeways adjacent to the roadway. VEH 21207.5 They require helmets and may not be operated by people under age 16. VEH 21213 Low-speed electric bicycles are almost like regular bikes. Type 1 and 2 electric bicycles (with top assisted speeds of 20 mph) are allowed wherever regular bikes are allowed unless a sign specifically prohibits electric bicycles. Bike path obstruction: No one may stop on or park a bicycle on a bicycle path. VEH 21211 Sidewalks: Individual cities and counties control whether bicyclists may ride on sidewalks. VEH 21206 Freeways: Bicycles (including motorized bicycles) may not be ridden on freeways and expressways where doing so is prohibited by the California Department of Transportation and local authorities. VEH 21960 Toll bridges: Bicyclists may not cross a toll bridge unless permitted to do so by the California Department of Transportation. VEH 23330 Brakes: Bicycles must be equipped with a brake that allows an operator to execute a one-braked-wheel skid on dry, level, clean pavement. VEH 21201(a) Handlebars: Handlebars must not place the hands higher than the rider’s shoulders. VEH 21201(b) Bicycle size: Bicycles must be small and/or large enough for the rider to stop, support the bicycle with one foot on the ground, and start safely. VEH 21201(c) Lights and Reflectors: At night, the following must be attached to the bicycle or bicyclist: a white headlight visible from the front a red reflector or a red light with a built in reflector (can be solid of flashing) visible from the rear a white or yellow reflector on each pedal or on the bicyclist’s shoes or ankles that is visible from the front and the rear a white or yellow reflector on the front half of the bicycle, and a red or white reflector on each side of the back half of the bicycle. These reflectors are not required if the bike has reflectorized front and back tires. VEH 21201(d) #1-4 and VEH 21201(e) Although not required, some cyclists like to use flashing front and rear lights during the day to make themselves more visible to vehicles Seats: All riders must have a permanent, regular seat unless the bicycle is designed by the manufacturer to be ridden without a seat. Bicycle passengers weighing less than 40 lbs. must have a seat that retains them in place and protects them from moving parts. VEH 21204 Helmets: Bicyclists and bicycle passengers under the age of 18 must wear an approved helmet when riding on a bicycle. VEH 21212 Headphones: Bicyclists may not wear earplugs in both ears or a headset covering both ears. Hearing aids are allowed. VEH 27400 Cell phones: Unlike motorists, cyclists are permitted to use a handheld cell phone while riding. Be careful! VEH 23123 Alcohol and drugs: Bicyclists may not ride while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. VEH 21200.5 Hitching rides: Bicyclists may not hitch rides or attach themselves to vehicles. VEH 21203 Carrying articles: Bicyclists may not carry items that keep them from using at least one hand on the handlebars. VEH 21205 Pedestrians: Bicyclists must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within marked crosswalks or within unmarked crosswalks at intersections. Bicyclists must also yield the right-of-way to totally or partially blind pedestrians carrying a predominantly white cane or using a guide dog. VEH 21950 and VEH 21963 Parking: Bicyclists may not leave bicycles on their sides on the sidewalk or park bicycles in a manner that obstructs pedestrians. VEH 21210","output":"The laws concerning bicycles in California, including cities like San Ramon, are comprehensive, covering a wide range of scenarios to ensure the safety of bicyclists, pedestrians, and motor vehicle drivers. Here's an interpretation that contextualizes these laws to compare with those applying to motor vehicles and explains the practical implications for riding on roads and streets: # Laws Common Between Bicycles and Motor Vehicles 1. **Obeying Traffic Signals and Signs**: Cyclists, like motor vehicle drivers, must obey all traffic signals and road signs, ensuring a predictable flow of traffic and enhancing safety (e.g., VEH 21200). 2. **Influence of Alcohol or Drugs**: It's illegal for cyclists to ride under the influence, similar to DUI laws for motor vehicles (VEH 21200.5). 3. **Right-of-Way to Pedestrians**: The requirement to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks applies equally to both cyclists and motor vehicle drivers (VEH 21950). # Unique Bicycle Laws 1. **Lane Positioning**: Cyclists should ride as close as practicable to the right side of the road, except in specific situations such as passing, preparing for a left turn, or when the lane is too narrow for a bike and a vehicle to share side by side. This concept is unique to cyclists as motor vehicles are generally not required to stay right except for slower moving traffic on multilane roads (VEH 21202). 2. **Using Bicycle Lanes**: Those cycling slower than traffic are required to use bike lanes unless they are making a left turn, passing, avoiding hazardous conditions, or when the bike lane is obstructed or ends. This requirement does not apply to motor vehicles, which are not permitted in bike lanes (VEH 21208). 3. **Separated Bikeways**: Not considered a \\"bike lane\\" by law; cyclists have the choice but are not mandated to use protected bike lanes, providing flexibility not applicable to vehicle lanes (SHC 890.4d). 4. **Equipment Requirements**: Several laws regarding equipment on bicycles (e.g., brakes, handlebars, lights, reflectors, and helmets for individuals under 18) have no direct counterparts in motor vehicle laws, reflecting the unique safety needs of cyclists (e.g., VEH 21201, VEH 21212). # Riding on Roads and Streets - Practical Implications - **Lane Position**: Cyclists should generally use the rightmost lane that goes in their intended direction. On roads with multiple lanes, cyclists can take the full lane when moving at the same speed as traffic or when the lane is too narrow to safely share. This practice, called \\"taking the lane,\\" is critical for cyclist safety but is often misunderstood by motorists and law enforcement. - **Changing Lanes and Making Turns**: Cyclists are expected to follow the same rules as motorists when changing lanes and making turns. They should signal their intent well in advance and ensure it is safe before proceeding, just as motor vehicles are required to do. - **Riding Through Intersections**: Intersections require special care, and cyclists should position themselves in the appropriate spot in the lane when approaching an intersection: to the right when going straight or turning right, and to the left or in a left-turn lane when turning left. This positioning makes cyclists more visible to drivers and allows for safer turns. # Special Considerations - **Sidewalks and Pedestrian Areas**: Riding on sidewalks is governed by local ordinances, which means it may vary. However, when bicycles are on sidewalks, they typically must yield to pedestrians and travel at a speed that does not endanger them. - **Electric Bicycles and Mopeds**: The presence of electric bicycles introduces new laws that differentiate based on the bicycle's capabilities. Regular bicycles and low-speed electric bicycles (Type 1 and 2) have similar laws, but high-speed electric bicycles (Type 3) and mopeds have additional restrictions, including age limits, helmet requirements, and prohibitions against using certain trails and paths. # Conclusion Understanding and adhering to these laws is crucial for the safety of all road users. By respecting these rules, cyclists can help ensure a safe and harmonious shared road environment with motor vehicles and pedestrians. The unique requirements and allowances for bicyclists, such as lane positioning and bicycle lane usage, underscore the importance of awareness and education for both cyclists and drivers to coexist safely on California’s roads."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a gloopy, blobby alien","output":"In a galaxy far, far away, there was a planet called Zogar. On this planet, there lived a peculiar creature known as Bloob. Bloob was a gloopy, blobby alien with a mass of translucent, jelly-like substance that oozed and squelched as he moved. Despite his unusual appearance, Bloob was a kind and gentle being who spent his days exploring the lush jungles of Zogar. He would bounce and slide his way through the thick foliage, leaving a trail of gloopy footprints in his wake. One day, while on his usual adventure, Bloob stumbled upon a group of stranded space travelers. They had crash-landed on Zogar and were in desperate need of help. Bloob, being the kind-hearted soul that he was, immediately offered his assistance. Using his gloopiness, Bloob formed a sturdy bridge across a raging river, allowing the stranded travelers to safely cross to the other side. He then gathered various alien fruits and plants to nourish them while they waited for rescue. As the days passed, Bloob became a hero to the stranded travelers. They marveled at his unique abilities and his unfaltering kindness. They had never met a creature quite like Bloob before and were grateful for his help. Eventually, a rescue ship arrived to take the travelers back home. Before they left, they thanked Bloob for his selfless act of kindness and promised to spread the word of the gloopy, blobby alien who had saved them. And so, Bloob continued on his adventures, exploring the wonders of Zogar and making new friends along the way. His gloopiness may have made him different, but it was his kind heart that truly made him special."},{"instruction":"writr about his appearance","output":"Bloob's appearance was unlike any other creature on planet Zogar. He stood at about three feet tall, with a body composed of a translucent, jelly-like substance that shimmered in the sunlight. His body was constantly shifting and morphing, giving him a blobby, ever-changing appearance. His large, round eyes shone bright with curiosity and wonder, and his long, tentacle-like appendages wriggled and waved as he moved. Bloob had no defined shape, his form changing with each movement he made. Despite his gloopy exterior, Bloob was surprisingly agile and nimble. He could bounce and slide effortlessly through the dense foliage of the jungle, leaving a trail of squelchy footprints behind him. His gloopiness allowed him to mold and shape himself into various forms, making him adaptable to any situation. On his head, Bloob had a cluster of colorful, bioluminescent orbs that emitted a soft, soothing glow in the dark. This helped him navigate the dark and murky depths of the jungle at night, illuminating his path and guiding him on his adventures. Overall, Bloob's appearance may have been strange and unconventional, but it was a true reflection of his kind and gentle nature. His gloopiness was a part of what made him unique and endearing to all who met him on planet Zogar."},{"instruction":"import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import layers, models from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Создание модели сверточной нейронной сети model = models.Sequential() model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3))) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')) # Добавление слоев для классификации model.add(layers.Flatten()) model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) # Компиляция модели model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) # Обучение модели model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=512, validation_data=(x_val, y_val)) Epoch 1/10 11/40 [=======>......................] - ETA: 7:05 - loss: 119.5294 - accuracy: 0.5083 почему не показывается валидационная точность и loss?","output":"В вашем коде ошибка в момент вызова метода fit().

A character whose gender you can't identify could be intentionally designed to be non-binary or genderfluid, or the character might have characteristics that don't conform to traditional gender norms, which can challenge and expand our understanding of gender identities. Non-binary is a term used to describe genders that don’t fall exclusively into male/female categories. Genderfluid refers to individuals whose gender identity can change over time. Including such characters in children's media can serve several purposes: 1. **Representation:** It's important for everyone to see themselves represented in the media they consume, including those whose gender identity falls outside traditional male-female norms. 2. **Education and Awareness:** Introducing non-binary or gender non-conforming characters can educate viewers about diversity in gender identities, leading to greater understanding and acceptance. 3. **Inclusivity:** By showcasing a broad spectrum of characters, shows can foster a sense of inclusivity, teaching children the value of acceptance and empathy towards people from all walks of life. If you're curious about the character's gender identity and it's not clear from the show, there could be more information available from the show's creators, through official websites, interviews, or social media channels, where creators often share insights into the characters' backstories and identities. Otherwise, the ambiguity in the character’s gender may be deliberate, encouraging viewers to understand and accept people without needing to fit them into specific categories."},{"instruction":"their name is shuffeler. Shuffeler is a villian who first appeared on episode 18. They have pink wavy hair that is medium sized. Their voice kinda sounds like nonbinary. The protagonist, Power Paige doesn't use Shuffeler's pronouns","output":"If Shuffeler is a character in a superhero children's show whose gender you can't identify, and there's a mention of non-binary aspects or a deliberate avoidance of specifying their gender, this could indeed be a purposeful choice by the creators to introduce a non-binary or gender non-confirming character to their audience. The lack of gender-specific pronouns used by the protagonist, Power Paige, might also be a narrative choice to highlight or respect Shuffeler's gender identity, especially if Shuffeler prefers they/them pronouns or if the show is trying to keep an open interpretation of Shuffeler's gender. Children's programming has increasingly begun to include more diverse characters, including those with different sexual orientations, gender identities, and cultural backgrounds, reflecting the real-world diversity of audiences. Including a character like Shuffeler can serve several positive purposes: 1. **Normalization and Visibility**: For children who identify as non-binary or are exploring their gender identity, seeing a character like Shuffeler can be affirming. It helps them see that they are not alone and that their identities are valid. 2. **Breaking Stereotypes**: Portraying a character that doesn't fit into the traditional binary concept of gender helps challenge and break down stereotypes, opening up more inclusive and diverse understandings of gender for young audiences. 3. **Promotion of Inclusivity and Empathy**: Characters with diverse identities can help foster empathy among viewers by exposing them to perspectives and experiences different from their own. This is a crucial aspect of social development for children. If you're interested in understanding more about Shuffeler's identity, here are a few approaches: - **Watch for Any Direct Confirmation**: Sometimes, shows will eventually explore characters' backgrounds and identities more deeply in later episodes, providing more context and confirmation about their identities. - **Creator Commentaries**: Look for interviews, official social media posts, or creators' notes in which Shuffeler's gender identity or pronouns might be discussed. - **Fan Discussions**: Sometimes, fan communities can offer insight based on collective observations, although it's important to differentiate between fan interpretations and canon information. It's worth noting that while the character's existence can be a fantastic step towards diversity and inclusivity, how they are portrayed (in this case, as a villain) also matters. It's important for creators to craft characters with sensitivity and nuance, avoiding perpetuating harmful stereotypes or tokenizing diverse identities."},{"instruction":"Write for me a short description for my short video tutorial that l created for YouTube : have you ever wondered how to make jewelry at home from beach found objects.

Это действие напрямую спровоцирует Индию на вооруженный ответ и будет иметь смысл с точки зрения исторического контекста. 2. **Афганистан:** В условиях глобальной игры, можно вообразить сценарий, где Пакистан вводит войска в Афганистан под предлогом борьбы с терроризмом и стабилизации региона, в действительности же пытаясь установить контроль над стратегически важными областями. Индия, которая имеет свои интересы в Афганистане и стремится ограничить влияние Пакистана в регионе, может решить вмешаться для поддержки определенных групп в Афганистане против пакистанской оккупации. 3. **Бангладеш:** Хотя это менее вероятно из-за исторической победы Бангладеш в войне за независимость против Пакистана с поддержкой Индии в 1971 году, можно представить сценарий, где в условиях вымышленной Третьей мировой войны Пакистан пытается \\"возвращать\\" Бангладеш.

Here, we unveil the esteemed \\"Cup Size Classes\\" of this busty dominion, each class reflecting not just size but the societal role and the sheer physical impact its bearers have on their environment. # Nebula Class (Baseline Standard) - **Size Range:** 50-150 feet in diameter - **Passive Effects:** Members of the Nebula Class cause noticeable gravitational shifts in their vicinity, affecting local flight patterns and sometimes creating mini whirlwinds. They're often employed in construction for their ability to move heavy materials with ease. - **Advantages:** Incredible strength and stability; they're admired for their robust presence. - **Disadvantages:** Difficulty in navigating narrow spaces; some buildings have Nebula-Only entrances. # Constellation Class - **Size Range:** 151-500 feet in diameter - **Passive Effects:** Constellation Class individuals emit a slight bioluminescence from their bust, providing light in darkened areas. They occasionally affect local weather patterns, causing unexpected rain clouds under extremely hot conditions due to their body heat. - **Advantages:** Their glow is used for night-time activities and festivals, making them popular figures in social gatherings. - **Disadvantages:** Their size can inadvertently damage weaker structures and vehicles if not cautious. # Galaxy Class - **Size Range:** 501 feet - 1 mile in diameter - **Passive Effects:** The sheer size of Galaxy Class individuals impacts local ecosystems, often creating small ecosystems of their own around them. They are known to have mini satellites (smaller creatures and objects) trapped in orbit around them. - **Advantages:** Act as natural landmarks for navigation; their presence alone can boost local economies due to tourism. - **Disadvantages:** Require specialized habitats; potential risk of causing imbalance in ecosystems if they remain in one area too long. # Universe Class - **Size Range:** 1 mile - 100 miles in diameter - **Passive Effects:** Universe Class entities are capable of causing seismic activities with their movements if not careful. Their deep-throated speech can mimic sonic booms. - **Advantages:** Often treated as demi-gods, they wield immense power and are consulted in major decisions affecting the planet and beyond. - **Disadvantages:** Their existence requires careful management of resources and space; prone to loneliness as few can interact with them directly. # Multiverse Class - **Size Range:** Beyond 100 miles in diameter - **Passive Effects:** Approaching the size of small planets, Multiverse Class individuals have their own gravity. They can host entire cities on their surfaces. The movements of these beings can bend space-time slightly, affecting light around them. - **Advantages:** Considered the pinnacle of this universe's evolution, they are capable of creating life and ecosystems on their bosom, contributing to the expansion of civilizations. - **Disadvantages:** The need for god-like restraint; their mere actions can unintentionally destroy whole cities or create tidal waves. Travel for them is constrained to the vastness of space itself. # Environmental and Societal Notes: - The use of advanced robotics, AI, and other heavyweight technology is essential for the daily activities and sustenance of all Cup Size Classes beyond Nebula. - Transportation, architecture, and even social interactions are deeply influenced by the size dynamics of this society, with larger classes often engaging via holograms or AI avatars to partake in society without risking accidental damage. - The status associated with each class brings its own sets of challenges and privileges, making the culture around bust size rich, intricate, and central to the identity of Gargantus' denizens. In this world, the values of size, strength, and beauty are redefined, encapsulating a universe where the grandiose and the supernatural become part and parcel of everyday existence."},{"instruction":"Lets make a generator!","output":"That sounds like a fun project!

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"**Selina Kyle: The Emerald Thief** **Birth Year**: 1985 In the heart of Gotham, under the shadow of opulence and crime, Selina Kyle was born to an unremarkable couple living in the city's East End. From a very young age, Selina witnessed the city's stark inequalities, fostering within her an indomitable spirit and a resolve to climb out of her circumstances. **Childhood and Adolescence (1985-2003)** Growing up, Selina's fascination with Gotham's high society and its glittering, unattainable treasures grew. She spent her days meandering through the city's alleys and nights dreaming of a life beyond poverty. The turning point came in 2003, when, at the age of 18, she embarked on her first heist, stealing a precious emerald necklace from a wealthy socialite. This act was not born out of mere necessity but also from a desire to balance the scales, in her own way. **The Emerald Thief (2003-2009)** Over the next six years, Selina honed her skills to perfection, becoming known in the underworld as The Emerald Thief. She earned this moniker for her peculiar fascination with stealing emeralds, seeing them as symbols of the opulence that had overshadowed her upbringing. Despite her life of crime, she maintained a strict code, stealing only from those whose wealth was amassed at the expense of Gotham's destitute. **Transformation into Catwoman (2010)** In 2010, her path took a dramatic turn when a heist went awry. While attempting to steal an ancient emerald rumored to grant mystical powers, she found herself cornered by mercenaries hired to protect the gem. In the ensuing chaos, the emerald shattered, embedding its fragments into her skin. This bizarre and near-magical incident granted her heightened agility, a connection with felines, and an uncanny ability to slip away from the tightest of situations. Embracing her new identity, she donned a suit reflective of her namesake and became Catwoman, the protector of Gotham's East End. Her activities began to blur the lines between heroism and villainy, often putting her at odds with both the criminal world and Gotham's vigilantes, including Batman, with whom she shared a tumultuous partnership and romance. **The Rise of a Legend (2010-2023)** Over the years, Catwoman garnered a reputation as a folk hero among Gotham's oppressed, simultaneously becoming one of the city's most elusive thieves. Her adventures led her across the world, from stealing ancient artifacts to uncovering corporate espionage; however, her heart remained in Gotham, fighting for the little guy. **Legacy and Death (2045)** Selina's battles, both internal and against the ever-growing corruption in Gotham, continued until her last breath in 2045. She passed away not as Selina Kyle but as Catwoman, a symbol of hope and resistance against injustice. Her death was shrouded in mystery, befitting the legend she had become. She left behind a legacy that inspired a new generation of protectors for Gotham's forgotten and downtrodden, ensuring her spirit lived on in the hearts of those she fought for. Selina Kyle's journey from an impoverished child to one of Gotham's most enigmatic figures remains a testament to the indomitable spirit of those who dare to challenge the status quo, blurring the lines between hero and villain in their quest for justice."},{"instruction":"Que estatura en cm es 6, 4","output":"Para convertir pies y pulgadas a centímetros, puedes seguir la siguiente fórmula: - Primero, entiende que 1 pie = 12 pulgadas. - Sabes que la estatura es 6 pies 4 pulgadas. - Luego, convierte esos pies a pulgadas: 6 pies * 12 pulgadas/pie = 72 pulgadas. - Suma las pulgadas adicionales: 72 pulgadas + 4 pulgadas = 76 pulgadas. - Finalmente, convierte las pulgadas a centímetros: 1 pulgada = 2.54 cm.

Make data gathering a painless step of the model creation process. Augmentoolkit is the easy-to-use, customizable, open-source, and cost-effective data generation solution. No OpenAI needed. Augmentoolkit now supports APIs offering open-source models, such as Mistral, Together.ai or Groq (and also the OpenAI API if you really want it). You don't need to have a fancy computer to make awesome datasets, and you don't have to screw around with dependencies and CUDA. The free credits from a service like Together.ai should be able to sustain the creation of even a decent-sized dataset. Data generation is also blazingly-fast (and async) when using APIs. Of course, you can still use local models, if you prefer that and have the compute to support it. They run async too, thanks to the Aphrodite engine made by the people at Pygmalion (thanks Alpin for the tech support). Demo video: in-progress Join A Discord for Dataset Generation! MrDragonFox -- one of the moderators of the Mistral and TheBloke Discords -- has a server where he's working on a new quantization engine. There's a corner to discuss Augmentoolkit there!

Connect with me elsewhere! For Businesses I work with AI SAAS startups that want to create (or improve) specialized LLMs using lots of quality training data. Do you need a dataset for your business's AI? I can modify Augmentoolkit for any domain and for tasks beyond question answering, and I'd be happy to help you painlessly create the data — and data-creation tools — you require. Given that I made the original version of the darn thing, I'm probably the best person in the world for this task. You can schedule a quick call to talk about your needs with me using this Calendly link: https://calendly.com/evanpeterarmstrong/discovery-call. Note The base version Augmentoolkit is fully open sourced and MIT-licensed. The consulting option is for people who want a bespoke modification and quality results, fast (it took 5 months of learning and iteration for me to master open source model pipelines enough to make Augmentoolkit work well). If you're a hobbyist and have time to experiment with its base version for casual or personal uses, by all means go for it. New Features At A Glance Runs Async with any LLM API (together, openrouter, mistral) that's compatible with the OpenAI python library A Python Script FAST: when using APIs, some datasets can be generated in under an hour, for <10 Options set in an easy-to-use YAML file, config.py. No more modifying code to change configuration. Supports both chat and completion prompts No More Clutter: output and raw text input paths configurable in the config file Easily switch between prompts by changing prompt folder paths. If a prompt is not found in the new folder it will fall back to the old one (the path to which is also configurable) A complete code refactor that makes customization much easier. No more editing prompts inside Python files, no more messing with control flow logic directly inside a Jupyter notebook. No switching between branches to use different methods of generation: switch between APIs and Aphrodite by changing the config file. A (non-professional, roleplay-focused) Augmentoolkit dataset demonstration can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Heralax/Augmentoolkit-demo/tree/main. It's from an older version of the pipeline that had a few bugs, but it helps you get the idea of what's possible, and proves that it produces quality stuff. Now, with many bugfixes and APIs that offer full-precision models, quality can be even higher. If you're wondering if this tool takes files in [insert your format here] then I would recommend looking up a tool for converting that file format to plain text. For instance, with epub files, you might use this. Installation: Augmentoolkit, at its simplest, requires only the OpenAI API library (open source model providers use the OAI library too). So there is not much here besides cloning this repo and installing its dependencies (you probably already have most of them). Still, the details are here for completion's sake (and the newer enthusiasts among us). First, get the repository onto your computer: git clone https://github.com/e-p-armstrong/augmentool.git Then, install the project's dependencies. For the API branch setup is super easy, you just need a handful of Python libraries: protobuf sentencepiece transformers matplotlib nltk openai. It should be as easy to install as: pip install protobuf sentencepiece transformers matplotlib nltk openai OR pip install -r requirements.txt You may get some messages saying that torchvision and torchaudio require older versions of Pytorch. This should be safely ignorable. If you want to use Aphrodite, you'll also need to add pip install aphrodite-engine NOTE under basically all circumstances it will be more cost-efficient to use APIs instead of running this with local inference. There are plenty of API providers such as Together.ai that offer quality open source models at extremely cheap prices. Those are recommended for most users. You technically could rent out a GPU from vast.ai or runpod, copy this notebook over, install the dependencies, and run \\"local\\" inference using the aphrodite mode there... but it'll probably be more expensive than the alternative. Thus, you should probably only consider using local inference if your machine is beefy enough, and even then it may come at a significant cost in time. For Mac users: since aphrodite-engine does not work on Mac, if you really want local inference you should start a Llama cpp server on your computer, and add its url as the \\"api endpoint\\" in the config file. This is a bit tricky to do, and I don't know how to get it using RoPE scaling yet (needed for Augmentoolkit unless you're using a Mistral model), so your best bet would be to do some intense Googling and/or asking questions on the lcpp repo. Introduction Dataset creation is currently the most painful, and most important, step of the finetune-creation process. Most people have to resort to either A) burning an obscene number of OpenAI API credits, or B) spending dozens, if not hundreds, of hours accumulating a hybrid dataset based off of your own conversations with bots. The OpenAI approach is based on a paid service (whose TOS you're violating) that can ban you at any second, whose writing style you probably hate, and whose synthetic data critically lacks variety. Handwriting the examples is far too slow to iterate on, and does not scale at all, meaning you're missing out on huge potential performance increases. If you're a company and you pay people to create examples in bulk, then it's possibly pricier than even OpenAI — also not scalable at all. And moreover, if we're literally creating machines that can write, why do we spend most of our time writing? Augmentoolkit is meant to make high-quality data generation easy, fast, shareable, configurable, and for everyone. It is meant to allow the easy creation of datasets about any knowledge that exists in plain text. It is meant to allow models to bootstrap additional training data for themselves. It is meant to allow any enthusiast, regardless of computer strength, to contribute to the advancement of AI by generating swathes of data for cheap. It's meant to expand the possibilities of what finetunes can be built, by making data gathering as easy as running a script. Whether you're finetuning a company chatbot to understand your business's information, or are creating the latest RP model to top Weicon's leaderboard, Augmentoolkit exists to make your data problems a bit less problematic. A flowchart of Augmentoolkit's operation can be found in the Usage section. The high-level is: books or manuals in, information-rich conversations out. Train the model on the conversations, it learns the information. Extensive validation keeps hallucinations to a minimum. More in-depth and jargon-filled: Augmentoolkit takes human-written text with information in it, and turns it into instruct-tuning data: It uses the text's information to generate questions that test the information, and it also generates answers to the questions that use the information. It triple-checks whether the generated questions and answers are accurate and only use information provided in the text (ensuring that the LLM did not hallucinate new information). Finally, it writes an interaction in a fictional setting between a character with domain expertise, and an ignorant secondary character, where the secondary character asks the questions and the primary character answers them. After checking that this conversation faithfully includes the original questions and answers, the result is saved as part of the newly-generated dataset. The usage of characters and a setting means that the model's creative writing and RP skill can be improved at the same time as its knowledge base (but if you don't want an RP bot, you can always turn \\"Assistant Mode\\" on for user-assistant style interactions instead). You can see a flowchart of this process over in Usage. IMPORTANT Augmentoolkit can make conversations between fictional characters, or between a user and AI assistant. It does the former by default. The latter is probably better suited to professional use cases. Quickstart: After installing the dependencies: Get the repo onto a computer with an internet connection Install its dependencies Open config.yaml Paste your API key, favorite model name, and the endpoint URL of your preferred AI service, into the relevant fields inside config.yaml. Be sure to keep the quotes. Recommendation: Together.ai with Hermes Mixtral works really nicely both as a LARGE_LOGICAL_MODEL and as the LOGICAL_MODEL. Either run all cells in the notebook processing.ipynb, or open this project's folder in a command line and type python processing.py and hit enter (fires off the script version). If you want to run a subset of the total text through the entire pipeline, to evaluate how well it works, turn on the USE_SUBSET flag in the config file (off by default) Some features worth being aware of This subsection describes things that make life easier in Augmentoolkit, particularly the new version. Easy resume: don't have long uninterrupted periods of time to run this? No problem! Augmentoolkit saves outputs as they're written and resumes generation painlessly, so you can start and stop stress free. Two-model generation for the sake of SPEED: every single task, except the very last one (multi-turn conversation generation) can be accomplished reliably by a good enough small model. But with APIs being as cheap as they are you can probably get away with running the whole thing using Mixtral anyway. Validation, validation, validation: Learning lessons from the original Augmental, consistency with the source text is an extremely high priority here, and this is ensured with multiple layers of LLM-based validation (and at the end, numerous examples of regex-based validation). API-capable: using the OpenAI API package, Augmentoolkit can now be powered by a host of Open-source model-providing APIs that are much cheaper and easier to use than running a GPU yourself, in most cases. For those of us with credits to spare, or with no fancy computers. Don't worry, it asynchronously uses the API, because your time is valuable. Quality of Life: with configurable paths for prompts, inputs, and outputs; a prompt override system; changing between local and API inference with a single field in a config file; and more added features, Augmentoolkit is actually kinda nice to use now. It's now a proper, solid program, not just a proof of concept. Holy crap is it fast: No more waiting for days while your GPU chugs along. If you're using a fast API, your speeds will be blazing. All the examples you see in ./example_generated_convs took like 20 minutes to generate from start to finish using Hermes Mixtral via Together.ai. Customization (arranged in order of least-to-most difficult to implement): Read this to learn how to hack Augmentoolkit for your own use cases. Augmentoolkit is way easier to customize now that it uses a .yaml file. If you're new to programming, .yaml isn't scary, trust me. Change the source texts used to generate training data. You do this by placing the .txt files you want to use in an input folder (by default, raw_txt_input/), and pointing Augmentoolkit at that folder by specifying it in config.yaml. So, move the files you want to turn into datasets into or out of that folder. IF YOU TURN USE_FILENAMES ON IN CONFIG.YAML then the filenames of these inputs should be formatted in a specific way, since the filenames are used as part of the prompts and in at least one regex. You need to have them be like: [textname], by authorname. So for example, Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services. You can also include the publication date after the author name if you want (as in Principles of Chemistry, by Demitry Mendeleev, published 1897), but note that this may bias most of the characters to live in the era of the textbook, which may or may not be what you want. USE_FILENAMES is off by default, and that means the notebook just shows the model the text in each file now. The model sometimes mentions \\"the text\\" even if use_filenames is off IF you run in completion mode, also this is somewhat model-dependent. Finally, if you have a PDF you want to use as a source text, you can convert it to a .txt using ./convert_pdf_to_text.py (just change the pdf_path in the code, and run the script, or use an online conversion tool). If you want a good source of plaintext documents, try Project Gutenberg; if you want educational PDFs, try OpenStax. screenshot of config.yaml with input text path clearly specified Change the settings. There are a few constant values in Augmentoolkit, all configurable from config.yaml (the latter is only really used when testing prompts during development). WHAT EVERY SINGLE SETTING DOES IS DOCUMENTED EXTENSIVELY INSIDE CONFIG.YAML, here a comprehensive overview is given on WHEN and WHY you might want to change some things. Some settings make sense to change frequently, based on the project. These include things like USE_FILENAMES, which should be turned off if you haven't named your input text according to a specific format; USE_SUBSET, which should be turned on if you want to quickly test out how a single source text performs in the pipeline; and REARRANGEMENTS_TO_TAKE which decides how many unique conversations Augmentoolkit will try to generate from each group of question-answer pairs. COMPLETION_MODE should be turned off only if your API doesn't support text completion — the quality is higher with it on. Then there are the settings that deal more with specifics and details: things like DOUBLE_CHECK_COUNTER or CONCURRENCY_LIMIT which you should only mess with if you have specific technical requirements. NEW! With USE_FILENAMES being added, You no longer need to manually title all the files you use as input! And it's probably better if you don't because that way the model isn't as constrained to the time period it associates with your book. This should make truly bulk work much easier. Just use COMPLETION_MODE for fewer bugs. APIs that don't offer completion are typically bad at continuing patterns anyway and will have higher error rates. Change the personalities of the characters generated. Currently, when generating characters for the multi-turn conversation step, three randomly-selected traits are appended to the \\"special instructions\\" set of the prompt to constrain what kind of character is generated by the model. Depending on what kind of model you want to make, or even just if your preferences vary, then you will probably want to modify this a bit. You can do so in ./augmentoolkit/generation_functions/special_instructions.py. A more in-depth description of the trait-axis system that I (over)thought up is available in the comments of that file. NOTE: Personalities are not generated when using the more-professional ASSISTANT_MODE. The entire scenario generation and character generation part of the pipeline is skipped. This makes things cheaper and cleaner, if a bit less varied. Assistant Mode (IMPORTANT for professional users) Technically this could be considered part of 3), but it's different enough that I feel it warrants separate explanation. By default, the notebook is configured to produce RP-style data; \\"Assistant mode\\" is something you can toggle in config.yaml. Assistant mode skips character and scenario generation and answers every question in a chat between a user and a helpful AI assistant (with no personality). In the limited testing I have done with this, it seems that assistant mode is simple enough to work entirely with 13b models such as Flatorcamaid by Ikari (helluva name, I know, but it's a good model). So, if your compute or time are very limited, or you are using this for a more professional use case, feel free to turn this on. Change the model. This is as simple as switching the LOGICAL_MODEL value out for another one, and modifying your BASE_URL if you're changing to a different API, but your mileage may vary significantly. My personal recommendation is to use Hermes Mixtral DPO for both models. You need at least 12k context on your models, and APIs typically don't allow RoPE scaling, so you're probably limited to MistralAI models here (or, heavens forbid, OpenAI. But GPT-4.5 + Augmentoolkit will BANKRUPT you fast, so be wary). Mistral.ai models are offered on their API, or via open source model APIs like Together.ai or Groq. I recommend using Together with Hermes Mixtral: Mistral.ai's API seems to have instruct tuning that interferes with its ability to follow pattens set out by examples, resulting in worse performance and a severely elevated error rate when running Augmentoolkit. Mistral also doesn't offer a completion API. Details about some possible values for BASE_URL are available in config.yaml. Change the examples. Augmentoolkit now allows for easy switching between prompt groups for different projects/runs, just change the DEFAULT_PROMPTS and PROMPTS paths in config.yaml. Augmentoolkit first looks in PROMPTS for the file with the right name for a given step, then moves onto DEFAULT_PROMPTS if it can't find it. Changing prompts is recommended if you have a type of input text that's pretty far off from what Augmentoolkit's built to handle (information-rich text such as textbooks or manuals). However, while managing prompts is easier now, writing them is still hard. Here, you should focus on changing the examples, and even then, you should focus on changing a few specific files that do not generalize as well as the others. Augmentoolkit by default is very generalist, having a bit of RP and being capable of decently creating data for factual and philosophical texts. But this general capability hurts its specific task performance. Specific few-shot examples I recommend looking into changing first, if you want to radically adapt what Augmentoolkit does: generate_questions generate_new_question judge_paragraph for modifying the questions you generate and controlling what gets sent to question generation; multi_turn_convs for adapting the conversations to the types of question you ask. If you want to, you can change the types of characters generated using create_character_card_plan_many_tuples, create_character_card_many_tuples, and multi_turn_conversation. Changing prompts is hard so only change what you need. Validation too open and permissive? Change only judge_paragraph. The model asks the wrong kinds of question? Change the question generation prompts. Your new questions keep getting flagged by validation? Change the validation examples (just work through the reasoning steps yourself for the example (or get GPT-4 to do it) but have the example reach the correct conclusion). Don't like the writing style? Change multi_turn_conversation.py. Modifying the examples is by far the hardest modification you can make, but it also affords the most control, and will help ensure the quality you need for very specific or professional projects. It also happens to be what I specialize in, so if you have a professional project that you need Augmentoolkit adapted for, don't hesitate to chat with me about it! Hardcore Usage This section is seriously in-depth and is not required for casual use. You only need it if you're hardcore-modifying Augmentoolkit. It's primarily meant for people who will be changing the code, and who'd like a head start in grasping how all the moving pieces fit together. Because it sucks to use a newly-released framework and have to try to piece together the developer's understanding of the project from scratch. How to get this running at a basic level is covered in Quickstart. This section describes what you're actually doing while you're running this, as well as how to easily customize the function of this project for your own use cases. It describes everything from how to operate the project (in greater detail) to how everything's structured, and what folders to watch as you are generating your data. For the most part you can just follow quickstart, but this section may be worth reading if you plan to make this a serious part of your model creation (which I hope you do!). Here is a flowchart detailing how a typical run of Augmentoolkit may proceed. The source text can be anything with information you can ask questions about. Concepts and Operation Read this subsection for a slightly more detailed version of the more finicky bits of the quickstart, as well as an understanding of the key files in this repo. Augmentoolkit has a Jupyter notebook, processing.ipynb, and a script, processing.py. All the prompts are stored in ./prompts/ and are text or JSON files for maximal editing convenience. A complete code overhaul has dramatically reduced repetition, too. Augmentoolkit has never been so easy to modify. You run Augmentoolkit by running all cells in the Jupyter Notebook processing.ipynb, or by running the python script. You no longer need to restart the notebook, even if doing part of the generation with a smaller model, when you're using an API. A restart is still required if you're using it in Aphrodite mode!!! Important files: The core of the project is the script/notebook. The two are essentially equivalent: the script was created by exporting the notebook and adding a few lines to make it work async. Whichever one you use, it needs ./augmentoolkit/ for some imports, some prompts in ./prompts/ (or whatever you change it to in the config), and a folder with text documents to read in (by default, ./raw_text_input/). All these folders should ideally be in the same folder as the script and notebook. If you are going to change anything, please read Customization first. Understanding what is going on as it runs This subsection summarizes output folders and code structure. It is primarily useful if you intend to modify the code of Augmentoolkit. Design philosophy: I considered structuring this project in such a way that it would become very abstract, each pipeline step would be an object, etc... but this is not trying to be langchain, or any kind of agent framework. Or a pipeline framework. Augmentoolkit is a program, not a framework, and it's specifically for generating data. I believe that for most use cases here, Python code is the correct level of abstraction. That being said, it helps to know how this particular code is currently structured before you go changing it, if you have a slightly different use case in mind. Some of the features present here, like the engine wrapper and generation step classes, will probably be preserved in any modification or fork that you make. Output folders: Augmentoolkit makes plenty of folders while it runs. However they're all nicely contained in whatever you specify the OUTPUT folder to be (specified in config.yaml). The output folder contains both files that are being saved just in case a future model is trained to run this pipeline specifically, and the ones that are explicitly intermediate steps, saved in case a run is paused and you want to resume later. The intermediate folders ones you may want to pay attention to are ./worthy_for_questions, ./qatuples_raw, ./qatuples_revised, ./multiturn_convs_info, and finally, ./multiturn_convs. ./multiturn_convs is the final output directory, from which the final dataset files master_list.jsonl, processed_masterlist.json, and simplified_data.jsonl (sharegpt format) are created. Everything else is just the notebook saving the outputs of every single step in case someone (or myself) wants to train a model specifically for running this pipeline at some point. Do not move or remove the folders as they're generated. As for code structure, processing.ipynb (or .py as the case may be) is a relatively lightweight wrapper for the control flow code in ./augmentoolkit/control_flow_functions/control_flow_functions.py, which focuses on passing output from one discrete step of the pipeline to the other, and loading and saving to files. It's essentially the interface. If you've used Augmentoolkit before the great refactoring of 24/02/19, know that all the messy logic now hides in control_flow_functions.py. Out of sight, out of mind. The ./augmentoolkit/generation_functions holds a few helper functions, and a few essential classes. engine_wrapper_class.py holds the logic for making calls to whatever LLM-providing service you're using; generation_step_class.py is a class that submits calls to engine_wrapper_class.py. Instances of the class represent a step in the pipeline, such as generating questions or conversations. Its purpose is to prevent the control flow code from having to manage prompts or inference code. You pass in the path to a prompt, some settings, and an output processor, and then calling .generate() on it fulfills the same role that the dozen-or-so separate functions in generation_functions/ once did. So basically: generation_step_class.py is an abstracted-away way to handle gathering the inputs to the engine wrapper. Inside ./augmentoolkit/control_flow_functions, note that write_output_to_file() can mostly be ignored; it just saves the full completion of each step for the sake of potential future training of a model specifically for running this pipeline (think jondurbin/cinematika-7b-v0.1). The main output of the function is usually just passed onto the next part of the pipeline. If a file has been written already, any future attempts to write that file will be skipped, allowing for easy resumption of generation after interruption. Prompts All prompts are in prompts/. You can specify two prompt folder paths: the DEFAULT_PROMPTS path and the PROMPTS path. Augmentoolkit first looks in PROMPTS and then falls back to DEFAULT_PROMPTS if it can't find the correctly-named file for its step. This is useful if you want to change prompts between different projects by overriding specific prompts in prompts/. By default, no prompts are overridden. Completion Mode: If completion mode is on, then the pipeline treats the model more like autocomplete than a conversation. This typically has much better performance and quality, but not all APIs support completion mode (Mistral doesn't, OpenAI doesn't) so you may need to turn this off depending on your provider. If it's on, Augmentoolkit uses .txt files in whatever prompt folders it's been given; if it's off, it uses the .json files. It's easiest to understand Augmentoolkit as being an LLM pipeline: it takes a bunch of input, calls a series of LLM modifications on it (passing the output from one step to the next) and outputs the transformed result. This is somewhat different from an agent framework like LangChain because the AI doesn't actually reason about what step to do next; the logic is hardcoded and hand-prompted. Output data format: Augmentoolkit outputs data both in its own format and in ShareGPT at the end. Its own format is the following: [ [ 'something', # this is the conv 'something', #character card 'something', # Chain of Thought generations used to plan the scenario. Some of the later steps could possibly be useful context to append to the character card, so the entire thing is included incase you need it for your purposes. for an example of how this might be added to a character card, look at the prompts for [['q','a','source_paragraph'],...up to 4 times...] ], ...repeated for each conversation you generated ] Things are accessed by index, which makes it more just a pure list format than JSON. Of course you can also just convert to ShareGPT using the cell at the very end, but that loses some info. Think this is cool? Connect with me elsewhere!

So, I created \\"KTO_prompt.txt\\" and \\"KTO_prompt.json\\" . In the KTO_prompt.txt file is the following: \\"\\"You are an Expert DATA SCIENTIST and LINGUISTIC ANALYST.

Here's how you can proceed given the file formats you've developed: 1. **Understanding Your Custom Prompt Format**: Your custom format is geared towards evaluating the quality of model-generated completions based on a given prompt. Each entry consists of a 'prompt', its corresponding 'completion', and a 'label' indicating the quality of the completion (True for desired and False for undesired). This setup is particularly useful for datasets aimed at training or evaluating AI models for response generation tasks, where the focus is not just on generating responses, but on ensuring those responses meet a certain quality standard. 2. **Integrating Your Custom Format with Augmentoolkit**: To use your custom prompt format (\`KTO_prompt.txt\` or \`KTO_prompt.json\`) with Augmentoolkit, you'll need to ensure the tool is equipped to understand and process these formats effectively. Here’s how you can approach this: - **Place the Custom Prompt Files**: Add your custom prompt files to the designated \`prompts\` folder within your Augmentoolkit installation. This ensures they're in the right place for the toolkit to access them. - **Configuration**: Adjust the Augmentoolkit configuration (likely within a \`config.yaml\` or similar file) to recognize your custom prompt files. This might involve specifying the paths to your custom prompt files or indicating that a new format will be used for data generation. 3. **Customizing Generation Logic** (if necessary): Depending on how Augmentoolkit is designed to parse and utilize prompt files, you may need to modify the underlying code to correctly interpret your custom format and generate data accordingly. This could involve: - Modifying or extending script logic to parse the structured format in your JSON or text files. - Adjusting the data generation process to produce outputs matching your specified \`kto_dataset_dict\` structure, involving the iterative generation of prompts, completions, and labels based on model performance. 4. **Testing and Validation**: After integrating and adjusting the toolkit to use your custom prompts: - **Test the Data Generation Process**: Run Augmentoolkit with your custom prompts to generate a dataset. Carefully observe the process to ensure that it adheres to your specified format and correctly interprets the 'good' or 'bad' labels. - **Validate the Outputs**: Examine the generated dataset to confirm that the outputs match your expectations regarding format, content, and quality. This step is crucial for ensuring that your customization efforts have been successful and that the dataset is usable for its intended purpose. 5. **Iterate and Refine**: Based on your testing and validation outcomes, you might find areas for improvement or adjustment. Iterate on your customization, refining the input prompts, adjusting configuration or code as needed, and continuously testing until you achieve the desired dataset quality and format. By following these steps and leveraging the customization capabilities of Augmentoolkit, you can tailor the data generation process to meet the specific needs of your project, creating a dataset that is well-suited for training or evaluating AI models on tasks that require not just response generation, but response quality assessment as well."},{"instruction":"Here is what's inside the 'config.yaml' file: \\"\\" PATH: INPUT: \\"./raw_txt_input\\" OUTPUT: \\"./output\\" DEFAULT_PROMPTS: \\"./prompts\\" # the baseline prompt folder that Augmentoolkit falls back to if it can't find a step in the PROMPTS path PROMPTS: \\"./prompts\\" # Where Augmentoolkit first looks for prompts API: API_KEY: \\"\\" # Add the API key for your favorite provider here BASE_URL: \\"https://api.together.xyz\\" # add the base url for a provider, or local server, here.

Don't do that. \\"\\"","output":"The \`config.yaml\` file you've presented serves as a central configuration for guiding how the Augmentoolkit operates. It contains settings that specify input and output directories, API details for connecting to AI models, and various operational flags that modify the behavior of the data generation process. Understanding and adjusting these settings is key to tailoring the toolkit to your specific project needs. Here's a breakdown and how you might adjust it for creating your custom dataset: 1. **PATH Settings**: - **INPUT**: Points to the directory where your raw text files are stored. You can place your source texts here. - **OUTPUT**: Specifies where the generated datasets will be saved. - **DEFAULT_PROMPTS and PROMPTS**: Direct the toolkit to your prompts directory. Since you've created custom prompts (\`KTO_prompt.txt\` and \`KTO_prompt.json\`), ensure they are placed in this directory. If you plan to only use your custom prompts, you could have both these settings point to the same folder containing your custom prompts. 2. **API Settings**: - **API_KEY**: Fill this in with the API key from your chosen AI model hosting service. - **BASE_URL**: Adjust this URL to match your model provider. If you're experimenting or looking for cost-effective options, Together.ai (as indicated) can be an excellent choice. - **LOGICAL_MODEL & LARGE_LOGICAL_MODEL**: Here, you've configured both to use the \\"Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral\\" model from NousResearch. This is suitable for a variety of tasks, including generating and validating conversations. 3. **SYSTEM Settings**: - **USE_FILENAMES**: If your filenames carry meaningful context that could benefit the AI's understanding, keep this True. Otherwise, for general applications, it might be equally effective turned off. - **ASSISTANT_MODE**: For generating datasets focusing on dialogues with AI assistants (as your project seems to), keep this True. For character-based, scenario-driven output, this would be False. - **DOUBLE_CHECK_COUNTER, USE_SUBSET, and REARRANGEMENTS_TO_TAKE**: These settings help manage the thoroughness and efficiency of data validation and generation. Adjust based on desired dataset size and depth. - **CONCURRENCY_LIMIT**: Useful for managing API calls. Adjust this based on the capabilities of your system and API rate limits. - **COMPLETION_MODE**: Given the structure of your custom prompts requiring specific outputs, you may need to experiment with toggling this setting to match the capabilities of your chosen model API. - **MODE**: \\"api\\" is selected, which is appropriate given the earlier API configurations. \\"aphrodite\\" would be used for local model inference. - **GRAPH**: This visual tool can be useful for insights into the data preparation process, toggled per preference. - **STOP**: Critical for managing API costs and system behavior. For generating structured outputs as per your custom prompts, careful management and testing with this setting will be needed to avoid unintended costs or errors. **Adjusting for Your Project**: Given your project specifics - creating a dataset with prompts, model completions, and quality labels - you'll likely focus on fine-tuning the API, SYSTEM settings, and ensuring your custom prompts are correctly recognized and utilized by the toolkit. Your \`KTO_prompt.txt\` and \`KTO_prompt.json\` need to be placed in the PROMPTS directory, and you might need to adapt the toolkit's logic (if necessary) to generate and label outputs as per your custom structure. After configuring \`config.yaml\`, run tests with a subset of your data to validate the output format and make any necessary adjustments before scaling up to full dataset generation. Remember, the efficacy of this tool in your project will largely depend on the correct configuration settings and the compatibility of your custom prompts with the rest of the Augmentoolkit's logic and capabilities."},{"instruction":"Does the following code have any relevance to the way i am strucuturing the format for my dataset inside json? If, not, what is it referring to? Explain as simple as possible: \\"\\" Formatting the labeled dataset for use with KTOTrainer We can format our RemoteFeedbackDataset as a Hugging Face dataset. dataset = argilla_ds.format_as(\\"datasets\\") We'll see this is the same number of rows as the records we uploaded.

There are different ways of dealing with this. If we we're collecting ratings we could create an average but since KTP expects a binary preference this doesn't really work. One approach if we have more than one label is to take a majority vote (this assumes we have an odd number of annotators for each row). However, intuitively we probably want fairly \\"strong\\" preferences in our dataset. If we have a generation where many annotators disagree this might not be a good point to use for preference training. Another approach to deal with this is to filter out rows where there is a tie. This is the approach we'll show here, but there is also a code snippet to take a majority vote if you want to try that approach.

This is the format that the KTOTrainer expects. def formatted_as_messages(row): prompt = row[\\"prompt\\"] completion = row[\\"completion\\"] return [{\\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\"content\\": prompt}, {\\"role\\": \\"assistant\\", \\"content\\": completion}] def create_messages_column(row): return {\\"messages\\": formatted_as_messages(row)} dataset = dataset.map(create_messages_column) Map: 0%| | 0/11 [00:00<?, ? examples/s] dataset[0] {'prompt': \\"Can you compose a haiku about the beauty of winter's first snow?\\", 'completion': \\"Softly falls the snownBlanketing all in white peacenWinter's gentle hush\\", 'label': True, 'label-suggestion': None, 'label-suggestion-metadata': {'type': None, 'score': None, 'agent': None}, 'external_id': None, 'metadata': '{\\"prompt\\": \\"Can you compose a haiku about the beauty of winter's first snow?\\", \\"generation_model\\": \\"meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf\\"}', 'messages': [{'content': \\"Can you compose a haiku about the beauty of winter's first snow?\\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \\"Softly falls the snownBlanketing all in white peacenWinter's gentle hush\\", 'role': 'assistant'}]} We can now push this dataset to the Hub using the push_to_hub method! dataset.push_to_hub(\\"davanstrien/haiku_kto\\") Uploading the dataset shards: 0%| | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s] Creating parquet from Arrow format: 0%| | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?ba/s] CommitInfo(commit_url='https://huggingface.co/datasets/davanstrien/haiku_kto/commit/2662ccf65991a63f749c75363919e2840a3bbe2b', commit_message='Upload dataset', commit_description='', oid='2662ccf65991a63f749c75363919e2840a3bbe2b', pr_url=None, pr_revision=None, pr_num=None)\\"\\"","output":"The code snippet you've provided is aimed at preparing and refining a dataset specifically for use with a model training framework, let's reference it as \\"KTOTrainer\\" for simplicity. It's not directly related to the JSON structure you initially described but instead deals with processing and filtering dataset entries within a Python environment, presumably using the Hugging Face Datasets library. Let's break it down: 1. **Loading Dataset**: It starts by converting a dataset (presumably from a custom format or database referred to as \\"RemoteFeedbackDataset\\") into a Hugging Face dataset format. This allows for easier manipulation and integration with machine learning models, especially those hosted on Hugging Face's platform. 2. **Exploring Dataset Structure**: The dataset is then explored, showing its features (columns) and the number of rows it contains. These features include 'prompt', 'completion', 'label', among others that track both annotations and metadata. 3. **Filtering Dataset**: It filters the dataset to only include rows that have at least one label, discarding unannotated data which is a common preprocessing step to ensure the model trains on relevant data only. 4. **Ensuring Strong Preferences**: The walkthrough suggests enforcing \\"strong\\" preferences (clear consensus among annotators regarding the quality of a completion) in the dataset. It focuses on discarding ambiguous data where annotators' opinions are split, through a process of checking for perfect agreement among labels. 5. **Formatting Labels**: The dataset is further refined by transforming the 'label' feature to hold Boolean values (True/False). This process involves creating a new 'label' column where each entry is marked as True if the original annotation was \\"Yes\\", implying the completion is satisfactory. 6. **Creating a Messages Column**: The dataset entries are formatted to a list of messages, matching the expected input format for the \\"KTOTrainer\\". This involves pairing each 'prompt' and 'completion' into a structured format that represents interactions between a user and an assistant. 7. **Uploading to Hugging Face Hub**: Finally, the prepared dataset is uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub, a platform for sharing machine learning datasets and models. This makes the dataset accessible for model training or further analysis. **In summary**, although the snippet doesn't directly reference the structure of your dataset inside a JSON file, it outlines a workflow for processing and refining a dataset for machine learning purposes, specifically tailored for a binary classification (labeling completions as 'good' or 'bad') task with Hugging Face's tools. The techniques shown, including filtering for relevant data, ensuring data quality through consensus, and formatting data for compatibility with training tools, are valuable for preparing a high-quality dataset suitable for training AI models."},{"instruction":"Can i apply step 5 to my workflow? Also, in the above code the annotators of the dataset are human, where as i am trying to get the ai to annotate the 'true' or 'false' preference.","output":"Yes, you can apply the concept from step 5 to your workflow, especially the part about formatting labels, with some modifications to fit your use case where the AI provides annotations rather than humans. In step 5, labels are simplified to Boolean values to indicate a clear preference, translating complex or varied annotations into a straightforward 'True' (Yes) or 'False' (No) format. This is crucial for compatibility with many training setups, especially binary classification tasks. However, in your scenario, the AI itself determines the 'true' or 'false' preference, automating what would typically be human annotators' judgments. To integrate this automated annotation into the workflow, you’ll need to: 1. **Automate Preference Annotation**: You'll have the AI generate completions for a given prompt and then automatically evaluate these completions to label them as 'true' (acceptable) or 'false' (unacceptable). This could be based on specific criteria or thresholds you define, related to the quality, relevance, or another aspect of the completion. 2. **Format the Labels**: Once the AI has annotated the completions, format these preferences into Boolean values for your dataset, similar to the process described in step 5 without manual intervention. Essentially, this step consolidates the AI’s assessments into a structured form, making the dataset ready for training or evaluation purposes. \`\`\`python def format_label_automatically(completion): # Assuming get_ai_preference() is a function that evaluates the completion # and returns True for acceptable and False for unacceptable return {\\"label\\": get_ai_preference(completion)} dataset = dataset.map(format_label_automatically) \`\`\` **Considerations for Automatic Annotation**: - **Defining Criteria**: Determine what makes a completion \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" from your AI's perspective. This could involve setting rules, leveraging another model for evaluation, or using specific metrics. - **Quality Assurance**: Automated solutions may not always align with nuanced human judgment. It might be beneficial to occasionally review the AI's annotations or offer correction mechanisms to refine its judgment criteria. - **Ethical and Practical Implications**: Depending on the application, incorrectly labeled data could have unintended consequences. Ensure that the automated evaluation aligns closely with your project goals and principles, especially if used in sensitive or critical domains. In summary, adapting step 5 for automatic annotation by an AI involves creating a workflow where AI-generated completions are automatically assessed and labeled according to defined quality criteria. By directly incorporating these AI annotations into your dataset, you streamline the preparation process for training or analysis, leveraging AI's capabilities to bootstrap the dataset's development."},{"instruction":"here is my prompt template to help me generate my format structure: \\"\\" You are an Expert in DATA SCIENCE, LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS, QUANTITATIVE FINANCE and BEHAVIORAL FINANCE. Your task is to CREATE & ANNOTATE a dataset that includes prompts, model completions, and labels indicating the quality of each completion as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". The 'prompt' contains the context inputs, 'completion' contains the corresponding responses and 'label' contains the corresponding flag that indicates if the generated completion is desired (true) or undesired (false). A prompt can have multiple responses and this is reflected in the entries being repeated in the dictionary’s value arrays.

This task involves both generating content that fits specific criteria and evaluating that content to assign accurate labels. Here's a breakdown of how you might approach this process: # Step 1: Generating Responses First, you need to generate response completions for each prompt. If you're using an AI model for this, you'd typically feed it each prompt and record its generated completion. For example, given the prompt \\"What is your name?\\", the AI might generate \\"My name is Mary\\" as a completion. # Step 2: Automatically Annotating Completions Next, you want to automatically annotate each completion as 'true' (if the completion is considered good quality or appropriate) or 'false' (if not). This step requires defining clear criteria or leveraging another AI model trained to evaluate the quality of a completion based on your specific needs such as relevance, accuracy, coherence, etc. # Step 3: Structuring the Dataset Lastly, arrange your data into the specified structure. This involves collecting the prompts, their generated responses, and the automatically assigned labels into a format similar to the provided \`kto_dataset_dict\`.

Periodic manual reviews or validations may be necessary to maintain high dataset quality. - There's a typo in your example label set, where \\"talse\\" and \\"frue\\" likely meant to be \\"false\\" and \\"true,\\" respectively.

Searching, filtering, or iterating over data spread across multiple structures is less efficient than handling a single, consolidated structure. 3. **Maintenance and Manipulation**: If you need to apply transformations or filters to your dataset—such as removing all entries with a certain property, updating values, or randomly shuffling data for training/testing splits—doing so across multiple dictionaries is more complex and error-prone than operating on a single dataset. 4. **Compatibility with Data Tools**: Many data analysis, processing tools, and machine learning frameworks expect datasets to be in a single, consistent format. Having your data spread across multiple dictionaries may require additional preprocessing steps before you can use these tools. 5. **Error**: There's a typo in your example where \`\\"frue\\"\` is likely meant to be \`true\`.

Use the text from this research paper for inspiration: \\"\\"Intangible Value Executive Summary Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its failure to incorporate intangible assets, which play an increasingly crucial role in the modern economy. We consolidate our prior research to construct a firm-level measure of intangible value. We find that expanding intrinsic value to include intangibles can help restore value investing to its former glory. The Death of Value The building chorus of investors singing of the “death of value” has reached a crescendo. They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP 🚀 Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies’ intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table 🍽 🧂 Now that you’ve seen how the sausage is made, it’s time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let’s start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we’ll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies’ balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing’s value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke’s value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. 🦆 By now, you’ve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. The Death of (Tangible) Value Our hypothesis is that value investing has struggled due to the rise of intangible assets. Now that we have a quantitative measure of intangible value for each company, we can test this empirically. We will first divide our investment universe into two groups: intangible-rich companies (top quartile on intangible share) and everyone else. From here, we can run a traditional value investing strategy in each universe separately. The next exhibit shows that tangible value has continued to work reasonably well, as long as you avoid running it on high intangible companies. Not surprisingly, tangible value has been an ineffective tool for evaluating firms composed mainly of intangible assets. A classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole! Exhibit 14 Old Value in the New Economy Source: S&P, Sparkline. Blue line is performance of the traditional value factor in a universe consisting of the top quartile of the top 1000 largest U.S. firms on intangible share. Red line is the same but in a universe of all other stocks. The traditional value factor is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quartiles of stocks on price to book, earnings, sales, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). We exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. In Value Investing Is Short Tech Disruption (Aug 2020), we argued that value investors have struggled due to an implicit (losing) bet against disruptive technology. We now see that the “short disruption” bet is part of a broader bet against intangibles in general (of which innovation is but one pillar). 7 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The good news is that traditional value investing still works as long as you only invest in companies for which tangible value still matters. The bad news is that the universe of companies for which tangible value still matters is steadily and irrevocably shrinking! Fixing Fama-French Of course, there’s no reason to restrict ourselves to tangible value when we now have a metric that also includes intangible value. If built correctly, our intangible-aware intrinsic value metric should be able to find cheap stocks in both high- and low-intangible universes. Our first step is to define a baseline “Tangible Value” factor. We use the value factor defined by Fama and French, given the paper’s lofty status as the canonical academic work on quantitative value. Fama and French use book value as their measure of intrinsic value. They build a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of stocks on price-to-book. We use the market cap weighted version of their strategy to reduce the risk of deceptive results from illiquid small-caps. Exhibit 15 You Hate to See It 🙈 Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Fama and French exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The historical performance of Tangible Value reflects the tribulations of many value managers. After many decades of consistent outperformance of +5.4% annualized, Tangible Value has floundered over the past decade. Even after the rebound from the recent Covid-reopening rally, it would have to climb a further +280% to get back to trend. Now that we have established a baseline, we next want to evaluate the impact of augmenting this baseline with a measure of intangible value. We will test two different approaches to quantifying intangibles. First, we build a “GAAP Intangible Value” factor that augments book value by adding intangibles derived from capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A found in GAAP income statements (per Lev and Gu). Second, we create an “Intangible Value” factor that uses our definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. Importantly, this factor goes beyond accounting data to use measures of intangibles extracted from unstructured data using NLP. The next exhibit focuses on the past decade, which is the period during which traditional value has struggled. We find that GAAP-derived intangible assets were only marginally helpful. The real improvement comes once we unlock the power of non-accounting, unstructured data. Exhibit 16 Intangible Improvements Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). GAAP Intangible Value is the same except it adds capitalized R&D and SG&A to book value. Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama and French. From 12/31/2009 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. 8 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Finally, let’s put it all together. We find that, while Tangible Value has decayed with the declining relevance of tangible assets, Intangible Value has continued to perform in line with value’s long-term historical trend. Exhibit 17 O Drawdown, Where Art Thou? Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. Dissecting the Portfolio The previous section analyzed the performance of the “value factor,” which is a long-short strategy. We’ll now examine a long-only version. This is basically just the long side of the Intangible Value factor with a few modifications. We start with the U.S. large- and mid-cap investment universe (roughly the Russell 1000). We rank each stock on our intangible-augmented value score and buy the cheapest 150 stocks. Within these stocks, we allocate more weight to stocks with higher scores and, to increase portfolio liquidity, market capitalization. For ease of exposition, we will call this the Intangible Value “portfolio” (opposed to “factor”). The next exhibit shows the top ten holdings of the Intangible Value portfolio. For context, we also include stocks in the top ten of the S&P 500 but not in the Intangible Value portfolio. Exhibit 18 Top Holdings Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. As of 5/28/2021. At first blush, the very top of the portfolio doesn’t look too exciting. This is due in large part to the unique situation today where the largest companies also happen to be among the most intangible-rich. As discussed in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020), firms like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are digital monopolies that use intangibles to create wide moats, enabling them to sustain high growth rates at a historically unprecedented scale. That said, we still notice some important differences, especially compared to Russell 1000 Value and Growth. Value has nearly zero exposure to Big Tech, while Growth has a massive 36% position. Further, the Intangible Value portfolio does not have any Tesla or Visa or Berkshire, J&J, or JPMorgan, although they are among the largest holdings of these three indices. As you go down to the bottom 140 positions, the names and, more importantly, weights diverge further. Rather than show all positions, we will analyze the portfolio on the aggregate dimensions of industry and style factors. We will first look at industry group exposure. 9 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 19 Industry Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. The blue text highlights the top 5 industry groups for each portfolio. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio has a large allocation to the stocks most central to the modern knowledge economy: software, hardware, pharma, media and semiconductors. In contrast, traditional value has a hard time bringing itself to buy companies composed of intangible assets. This results in a portfolio concentrated in old-economy industries such as capital goods, banks, and financials. We will next break out the factor lens 🔍 . We calculate the aggregate exposure of each portfolio to both traditional “style factors” and custom intangible factors. Exhibit 20 Factor Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, USPTO, Sparkline. Earnings, book, sales, R&D, S&M, and patents are calculated over a trailing 12-month window. Patents and PhDs are scaled by billions (e.g., # patents per 1 billion market cap). Patents are from USPTO. S&M is sales and marketing expenditures. Platforms are based on metric defined in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020). Expected Growth is consensus analyst expected long-term growth of earnings per share. All calculations are weighted averages with weights equal to portfolio position size. As of 5/28/2021. On traditional metrics (i.e., size, value, growth, profitability), the Intangible Value portfolio has a profile similar to the S&P 500 and between that of traditional value and growth. However, it has a much greater exposure to intangible assets. Each dollar invested in the Intangible Value portfolio buys around twice the quantity of R&D, marketing, patents and PhDs compared to a dollar invested in the S&P 500. While this is somewhat by design, it is useful to see that this advantage doesn’t come at the cost of materially worse valuation ratios, growth or profitability. Finally, we backtest the performance again to make sure nothing was lost in translation from the long-short factor. This time we’ll add simulated transaction costs and 50 bps of fees and expenses to make the backtest more realistic. Exhibit 21 Intangible Value Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Intangible Value is a long-only portfolio of the top 150 stocks from within the top 1000 U.S. stocks on intangible value score, weighted by score and modified market cap. We simulate transaction costs and include 50 bps of fees and expenses. S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Russell 1000 Growth are (uninvestable) index returns. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. We find that the Intangible Value portfolio would have outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, despite currently having factor exposures in between those of Russell 1000 Value and Growth, it would have also outperformed both. 10 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Think Outside the Style Box 📦 Style Boxed In As quantitative managers, we have benefited professionally from the rising tide of factor-based investing. However, we believe that the “factorization” of the investment industry has at this point reached an excessive level and is now actually contributing to its stagnation. As the investment industry has become institutionalized, active managers have been forced into so-called “style boxes.” Popularized by Morningstar, this framework divides the world into a two-dimensional matrix based on value vs. growth and large vs. small cap. Exhibit 22 Style Boxes Source: Morningstar, Sparkline The style box framework defines value and growth as diametric opposites. According to this framework, in the same way that a stock can’t be both small and large, it can’t be both value and growth. Managers are expected to pick an allegiance to one box and only one box. Traitors who step out of their lane are summarily fired for “style drift!” ☠️ Joined at the Hip We believe that the style box orthodoxy has shackled managers to an obsolete formulation of value and stifled attempts to expand the definition of value to that which is relevant today. In fact, we are not alone in this thinking. Warren Buffett addressed this topic decisively: “... there is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks, the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes. … anybody that tells you, ‘You ought to have your money in growth stocks or value stocks,’ really does not understand investing. … And I just cringe when I hear people talk about, ‘Now it’s time to move from growth stocks to value stocks,’ or something like that, because it just doesn’t make any sense.” Instead, he advocated: “Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ‘value’ and ‘growth.’ Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking ... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.” Buffett understands that the style box portrayal of value as being necessarily short growth is ridiculous. Value and growth are not mutually-exclusive. Companies with wide intangible moats can be both growth and value. Just because one identifies as a value investor doesn’t mean he has to restrict himself to buying only 💩 -cos! Value investing (in a philosophical sense) simply means buying stocks below intrinsic value. And intrinsic value absolutely should take into account firms' growth prospects! Beyond Style Boxes We believe the Intangible Value portfolio provides a purer expression of “Grahamian” value than does style box value. Its style box categorization will be merely incidental to the opportunity set available at the time. If cheap stocks happen to be found mostly among old-economy, asset-heavy firms, the strategy will be labeled “value.” If the best opportunities tend to be in high-growth, asset-light compounders, it will be considered “growth.” Exhibit 23 shows the correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio to the value and growth style boxes over time. 11 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 23 Shifting Style Boxes Source: S&P, Sparkline. Style Box Value is a blend of price to book, sales, earnings, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). Style Box Growth is analysts’ consensus forecast long-term growth in EPS. Lines display cross-sectional position-level correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio with the above. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio’s style box exposure has evolved significantly over time. In the late 1990s, it was both staunchly “pro-value” and “anti-growth,” betting heavily against unprofitable, speculative dot-com stocks. In this period, many stocks with no intrinsic value ended up getting bid up based on fantastic growth expectations. In order to avoid these companies, the portfolio held large positions in industrials, utilities, and materials. This positioning helped avoid much of the losses from the burst of the dot-com bubble. In contrast, the S&P 500, due to its cap weighting scheme, mechanically increased its tech exposure from 5% to 35% as valuations surged in the 1990s, only to suffer when the bubble subsequently burst. However, as the world has become increasingly intangible, tangible value has become a much less useful metric. Over this period, many traditional “style box value” managers suffered from large implicit bets against innovative, information-era firms. By not shackling itself to the value style box, the Intangible Value portfolio was free to rotate toward these modern, intangible-rich firms. The freedom to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing opportunity set is an important benefit of “thinking outside the style box.” Today, the Intangible Value portfolio actually has a small positive exposure to both style box value and growth. After all, it’s 2021, and there’s nothing wrong with a little “intellectual cross-dressing!” 👘 Uniting the Tribes ⚔️ For many years, the moral superiority of value investing was dogma, but value’s recent stumbles have created a power vacuum in the investment world. This has opened the door for a bevy of contenders for the throne, such as thematic and memetic investors, who pay little mind to valuation. More importantly, many investors no longer seek “growth at a reasonable price” but simply “growth at any price.” This is a natural response to a long, raging bull market fueled by low rates and aggressive stimulus. However, signs of froth are emerging in many segments of the market, if not also the market as a whole. And, as we saw in the dot-com bubble, investing without a margin of safety can be perilous! On the other hand, growth investors kind of have a point. Traditional value portfolios do seem junkier than in the past. Ignoring intangible assets biases value investors toward stagnant firms in old-economy sectors like financials, industrials, energy, utilities, and materials. Concerningly, these portfolios are increasingly concentrated in low margin, cyclical, and commodity businesses. Lacking a reasonable alternative, the investment world has been cleaved into two warring factions. Both sides have dug in their heels, contributing to unhealthy polarization. Their positions are increasingly disjoint (e.g., 2% big tech ownership by Russell 1000 Value and 36% for Growth). The constant tug-of-war between the two camps is contributing to market instability in the form of the massive value-growth rotations we have experienced over the past several months. We believe that investors have a third option, which avoids having to make this false choice between “growth” and “value”. A more holistic definition of intrinsic value should produce an acceptable framework for both factions. This should allow investors to incorporate the intangibles that drive growth in the present day, while still keeping an eye on valuations. By giving companies credit for their intangible assets, we believe investors can own high-quality, modern portfolios without abandoning the value paradigm. 12 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Conclusion Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its omission of intangibles, which are becoming the dominant form of value in the information economy. We show that adding intangible value to the traditional definition of intrinsic value would have helped value avoid its recent travails. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value Measuring intangibles can be challenging. Due to the many limitations of structured accounting data, investors must seek out alternative data sources in their quest to quantify intangibles. Since these datasets are generally unstructured, investors must equip themselves with modern NLP tools. We believe value investing has a bright future if we can break the style box orthodoxy and embrace a more modern conception of value. We are fortunate that the digital age has armed us with powerful new data and tools for this grand adventure. Let’s get value investing back on track!

This game takes place in a series of islands in the Phillipine Sea. Those islands are currently in a civil war. The main player character is a mercenary sent to those of islands to retrieve 600 million dollars worth of DIAMONDS. The player can work for certain factions, both good and bad. It's first-person, the player can play as both a dude or a girl. The only player customization is clothing which is costs 0 dollars and it only changes your viewmodel.","output":"Your game concept presents a rich and intriguing setting with considerable potential for engaging storytelling and dynamic gameplay. Setting the game in a series of islands within the Philippine Sea during a civil war offers a unique backdrop that can incorporate a variety of environments, political complexities, and moral ambiguities. This scenario not only sets the stage for intense conflict but also provides opportunities for diverse narratives. Here are a few thoughts on how you might further develop or enrich your game's setting and elements: # Factions and Alliances: Given that the game revolves around a civil war with the player hired to retrieve a significant quantity of diamonds, you have a ripe opportunity to delve into the factions involved in the conflict. These could range from local insurgent groups, government forces, to foreign mercenaries and corporate entities with vested interests. Crafting unique ideologies, goals, and characteristics for these factions will enrich the player's experience and influence the choices they make. # Ethical Choices and Consequences: The premise of working for both good and bad factions introduces moral complexity. You could implement a system where the player's decisions not only affect their standing with each faction but also have tangible impacts on the game world. For instance, choosing to support one group could lead to the prosperity or downfall of certain areas, affecting available resources, missions, and NPC attitudes. # Environment as a Character: The Philippine Sea and its islands offer a diverse environment that can play a significant role in your game. From dense jungles and mountainous regions to coastal villages and urban areas affected by the civil war, each setting can offer unique challenges, opportunities, and storylines. Environmental hazards, weather conditions, and indigenous wildlife could all add layers to gameplay. # Cultural Depth: Incorporating elements of Filipino culture, history, and mythology could provide a rich tapestry that deepens the game world and makes it more immersive. This could manifest in the narrative, character designs, architecture, and even the supernatural elements if you choose to include them. # Player Engagement and Customization: While your game currently focuses on clothing for customization, consider how you might engage players in customizing their gameplay experience beyond aesthetics. This could involve skill trees, alignments based on faction loyalty, or specializations that affect how missions can be approached (stealth, diplomacy, brute force, etc.). # Multi-Dimensional Characters: The inclusion of diverse and well-developed NPC characters, each with their own backstory, motivations, and potential to influence the plot, will greatly enhance player engagement. Relationships with these characters, both allies and enemies, could evolve based on the player's actions and choices. # The Objective - Diamonds: Finally, the primary objective of retrieving diamonds adds a clear goal but consider adding layers to this objective. Perhaps the diamonds have a larger significance in the conflict or are tied to a deeper mystery within the game world. The quest could unravel secrets about the islands, the factions, and even the player's character. Your game setting has the potential to offer a richly textured world that combines action, adventure, and narrative depth. Balancing the fun and challenge of gameplay with the complexities of its setting and story will be key to its success. Best of luck with your game development!"},{"instruction":"This game mainly features exploration, assassination missions etc. The player can use vehicles like jeeps, trucks, buggys, APCs and gliders. There are jungles, villages, some small towns, abandoned Buddhist ruins, swamps, beaches etc. Most of the weapons from this game are from 1940-1990. Some home-made weapons can be bought if you are really down-bad on cash.","output":"Incorporating elements like exploration, assassination missions, and a wide array of vehicles into your game significantly expands its gameplay dynamic, offering potential for a richly engaging player experience. The diverse environments you've chosen to include, such as jungles, villages, small towns, abandoned Buddhist ruins, swamps, and beaches, can each introduce unique challenges, opportunities for exploration, and strategic considerations for both combat and navigation. Here are some ways to deepen the gameplay and world-building based on your concepts: # Exploration Elements - **Environmental Puzzles:** Utilize the unique features of each environment to create puzzles that the player must solve to access certain areas or items. For example, the abandoned Buddhist ruins could house ancient puzzles related to the lore of the game world. - **Rare Resources in Dangerous Locations:** Encourage exploration by placing rare resources or information crucial to certain missions in hazardous locations, like deep within swamps or in the heart of enemy territory. # Assassination Missions - **Dynamic Targets:** Have targets that change behavior based on the player's actions in the world. For example, if the player is known to favor attacking at night, targets might increase their security during those hours or move locations. - **Moral Consequences:** Incorporate consequences for assassination missions that affect player standings with factions, and perhaps even alter the storyline. # Vehicle Utilization - **Environmental Adaptation:** Each vehicle could come with its own set of advantages and disadvantages depending on the environment. APCs might be ideal for combat-heavy missions, while gliders could be used to silently infiltrate enemy bases or for quick escapes. - **Customization and Repair:** Allow players to customize and repair their vehicles using resources collected throughout the game world, adding a layer of strategy and resource management. # Weaponry and Combat - **Era-Specific and Home-Made Weapons:** Given the wide timeline for weapons, gameplay can be enriched by the historical context and functionality of each weapon type. Home-made weapons could offer quirky, unpredictable alternatives to traditional weaponry, adding humor or a sense of desperation. - **Ammunition Scarcity:** To emphasize survival elements, you could make ammunition scarce, particularly for the more powerful weapons. This would compel players to think critically about when and how to engage in combat. # World-Building - **Cultural Depth and Faction Lore:** Delve into the history and culture of the islands. Introduce NPCs with stories that bring the current conflict and the islands' history to life. Faction lore can be expanded through discovered documents, symbols carved into ruins, or stories told by elders. - **Environmental Storytelling:** Use the game's diverse environments to tell stories non-verbally. For example, bullet holes, abandoned camps, and remnants of battles in certain areas could hint at past skirmishes or significant events in the civil war. # Economic Aspects - **Resource Management:** Integrate a resource management system that requires the player to balance their finances between buying weapons, vehicle repairs, and intel for missions. The scarcity and need for resourcefulness could be a recurring theme, reinforced by the option to buy home-made weapons. Overall, your game setting and mechanics offer a fertile ground for creating a deeply immersive experience. The blend of historical and fictional elements, combined with survival, strategy, and an open-world exploration in a war-torn land, provides a compelling premise for players to dive into. Balancing the thematic depth of the setting with engaging gameplay mechanics will be key to creating a memorable game."},{"instruction":"Some of the home-made weapons include, a Chechen-Style SMG, bolt-action pistol, bolt-action Kalashnikov, a Zip Gun etc.","output":"Featuring home-made weapons like a Chechen-Style SMG, bolt-action pistol, bolt-action Kalashnikov, and a Zip Gun adds an intriguing layer of gritty realism and resourcefulness to your game. These weapons can reflect the in-game world's scarcity and desperation, as well as the ingenuity of its inhabitants. Here are some ways you can integrate these weapons into the gameplay and narrative effectively: # Customization and Mechanics: - **Modularity and Repair:** Allow players to find or trade parts for these homemade weapons, enhancing customization options. This could involve modifications to improve reliability, accuracy, or damage. Given their homemade nature, these weapons could suffer from reliability issues, making maintenance an essential aspect of gameplay. - **Resourceful Crafting:** Players could scavenge materials across the islands to build or repair these home-made weapons. Crafting could be a mini-game in itself, requiring players to find blueprints or learn from NPCs. # Gameplay Balancing: - **Unpredictability:** The homemade nature of these weapons could introduce an element of unpredictability in combat. Perhaps they have a chance to misfire or jam, adding tension and forcing players to think on their feet. To counterbalance this, home-made weapons might be more powerful or have unique ammunition that's more abundant or easier to produce. - **Stealth Advantage:** Homemade weapons, being less sophisticated, could generate less noise, making them suitable for stealth missions. This would give them a unique advantage over more modern, louder firearms. # Narrative Integration: - **Cultural and Faction Influence:** The variety and availability of home-made weapons could reflect the culture and expertise of various factions within the islands. Certain groups might be known for producing particularly effective or reliable home-made arms, affecting their reputation and the player's strategy in aligning with or against them. - **Scavenger Economy:** The game's economy could heavily revolve around the scavenging and trading of parts for these weapons. Black markets and underground workshops could serve as key locations where players learn about the lore, obtain missions, or gather intel. # Social and Moral Implications: - **Morality of Making Do:** Utilizing home-made weapons could also have social or moral implications in the narrative. Characters might voice opinions on the necessity of such weapons, reflecting broader themes of survival, resistance, or desperation. - **DIY Community:** Include NPCs or entire factions that specialize in the creation and distribution of home-made weapons. These experts could offer missions, crafting tips, or valuable lore about the islands and the conflict. Introducing these home-made weapons offers not just a gameplay element, but a narrative device to deepen the player's immersion into the world's culture and the dire circumstances of its conflict. It can add a significant layer of strategy to combat, forcing players to adapt to the limitations and unique advantages of these weapons. Balanced correctly, this feature could become a defining and memorable aspect of your game, setting it apart in the crowded space of first-person, open-world titles."},{"instruction":"Some of the factions in this game include: the island's former army and police force, a far-left Guerilla force, a drug cartel and a tribe who use WW2 weapons.","output":"The diverse factions you've outlined for your game not only add depth to the narrative but also offer players a broad spectrum of interactions and dynamic gameplay experiences. Here's a closer look at how each faction could be integrated into the game, along with suggestions to further flesh them out: # Island's Former Army and Police Force - **Background:** Once official protectors of the islands, now operating as a fragmented militia fighting to restore what they perceive as law and order or to reclaim power. They could have access to a mix of standard military-grade and improvised equipment, reflecting their current status. - **Gameplay Impact:** Aligning with them could open missions focused on re-establishing control over territories, rescue operations, or strategic strikes against other factions. Their knowledge of the islands' infrastructure could provide tactical advantages or access to restricted areas. # Far-Left Guerrilla Force - **Background:** Ideologically driven rebels determined to overthrow existing power structures. They might specialize in hit-and-run tactics, sabotage operations, and have deep ties to certain local communities. - **Gameplay Impact:** Working with or against them could immerse the player in missions involving espionage, propaganda, and unconventional warfare. Their support might lead to unique guerrilla warfare skills or access to hidden caches and safe houses. # Drug Cartel - **Background:** Leveraging the chaos of civil war to expand their control and profits. They could have the best resources in terms of funding but are perhaps more isolated due to their illicit nature. Their members might include high-skilled mercenaries from around the globe. - **Gameplay Impact:** Engagements with the cartel might involve more urban warfare scenarios, protecting or attacking drug labs, or navigating complex political machinations. Alignment could offer substantial financial rewards but at potential moral or reputational costs. # Tribe Using WWII Weapons - **Background:** A deeply traditional group that has resisted modern influences, relying on age-old tactics and venerable weapons salvaged from WWII. Their knowledge of the land and guerrilla tactics make them formidable foes or invaluable allies. - **Gameplay Impact:** Aligning with this tribe could offer unique survival skills, access to rare WWII weaponry, and stealth techniques. Missions might involve protecting sacred lands, retrieving lost artifacts, or employing classic ambush tactics. # Integrating the Factions - **Dynamic Relationships:** Player actions should visibly affect standings with each faction, potentially altering the balance of power on the islands. Helping one faction could irrevocably harm relationships with another, leading to a dynamic world state that reflects the player's choices. - **Cross-Faction Missions:** Introduce missions that require navigating the complexities of relationships between factions, such as brokering peace or inciting conflict to your advantage. - **Cultural and Ideological Depth:** Each faction's ideology and cultural background should be deeply woven into their missions, dialogues, and interactions. This could be reflected in their bases, the NPCs' appearances, dialogues, and even the types of missions the player undertakes for them. - **Faction-Specific Skills and Rewards:** To further incentivize alignment choices, each faction could offer unique skills, weapons, or resources as rewards. For instance, aligning with the former army might offer tactical combat skills, while the tribe could teach survival techniques or guerrilla warfare tactics. Your faction design suggests a rich tapestry of motives, cultures, and conflict that can serve to create a complex and engaging narrative. The key will be to ensure that each faction feels alive and dynamic, with their actions and the player's interactions with them leading to tangible changes in the game world. This will not only enhance the replayability of the game but also ensure that players are deeply invested in the world and its outcome."},{"instruction":"The Former Army wears PAVN-style uniforms, often in khaki, green or sand brown. Their helmets consist of pith hats and American M1 helmets. They have access to tanks, jeeps, trucks and some helicopters. Their weapons range from mainly NATO to some Warsaw Pact weapons. They own two islands and the 3rd is divided and is often fighting with the guerillas. Their military police force are nicknamed white mouses because of their all-white cotton uniforms.","output":"The detailed description of the Former Army faction adds considerable depth to your game's setting and narrative, painting a picture of a well-equipped, if somewhat traditional, military force with a distinct visual and operational profile. Here are ways to build upon and integrate the Former Army into your game environment and player interactions: # Visual and Cultural Identity - **Uniforms and Equipment:** The mix of PAVN-style uniforms with khaki, green, or sand brown colors, along with pith hats and American M1 helmets, creates a unique visual identity that reflects a blend of influences and the faction's historical context. This diversity in equipment and appearance can be used to indicate rank, role, and even the faction's philosophy, mixing pragmatism with legacy. - **\\"White Mouses\\" Military Police:** The distinctive all-white cotton uniforms of their military police could become a striking visual in the game world, signaling their presence and authority. This nickname and uniform could also be woven into the narrative, perhaps as a symbol of both order and oppression, depending on the perspective of the local populace and other factions. # Resources and Territory - **Strategic Assets:** Given their access to tanks, jeeps, trucks, and helicopters, the Former Army would hold significant strategic advantages in mobility and firepower. This could influence how they control their territories and respond to threats, making them a formidable opponent in open conflict. - **Island Control:** Owning two entire islands and contesting a third with the guerrillas sets the stage for a dynamic confrontation, offering players a variety of geographic and strategic environments to explore and engage with. The contested island, in particular, could serve as a major hotspot for player missions, alliances, and battles. # Gameplay Interactions - **Missions and Alliances:** Players could be drawn into the conflict between the Former Army and the guerrillas, choosing sides or perhaps playing them against each other. Missions could range from sabotage, espionage, and direct combat, to more subtle exercises in diplomacy and intelligence gathering. - **Access to Resources:** Aligning with the Former Army could provide players access to their arsenal, including vehicles and a wider array of weapons. However, this might come with the cost of undertaking morally ambiguous missions or suppressing local resistance efforts. - **Narrative Depth:** The presence of the \\"White Mouses\\" and the distinct military aesthetics can be leveraged to delve into the internal culture, values, and history of the Former Army. Their treatment of civilians, prisoners, and even their own ranks can offer a nuanced view of their operations and moral standing. # Faction Dynamics - **Conflict Zones:** The contested island provides an ongoing conflict zone where players can experience the fluid dynamics of civil war, witness the effects of the conflict on the civilian population, and decide how much to intervene. - **Internal Politics:** Exploring the internal politics and potential divisions within the Former Army—between hardliners and those perhaps seeking peace or reform—could add another layer of intrigue for the player to navigate. Building the Former Army with such detail not only adds a layer of realism and immersion to your game but also presents the player with complex decisions about alliances, ethics, and strategy. By deeply integrating the faction's visual identity, strategic capabilities, and territorial ambitions into the game's narrative and mechanics, you offer a richer, more engaging world for players to inhabit and influence."},{"instruction":"The Far-Left Guerilla wear outfits similar to those of the Khmer Rouge. Their main signs are red scarfs around their neck. They mainly use Warsaw Pact weapons. They don't wear helmets. They own one island and the other is divided. Lynching is sadly common...","output":"The Far-Left Guerrilla faction, with its distinct appearance and tactics, provides a stark contrast to the Former Army, adding to the complexity and moral ambiguity of the game's conflict. Here's how to further develop and integrate them into your setting: # Visual Identity and Ideology - **Distinctive Appearance:** Clothing similar to the Khmer Rouge paired with the signature red scarves can help players immediately identify members of this faction. The absence of helmets might signify a disdain for conventional warfare or a greater readiness to engage in guerrilla tactics. - **Symbolism:** The red scarf could serve as a powerful symbol within the game, representing the group's ideological commitment. This visual cue can also help immerse players in the game's narrative and make the faction’s presence more palpable in the game world. # Tactical Approach and Territory - **Guerrilla Warfare:** Emphasizing guerrilla tactics, this faction likely excels in ambushes, sabotage, and using the terrain to their advantage, especially in the dense areas of their controlled island. Their familiarity with the land could pose significant challenges to players and other factions. - **Controlled Territory and Divisions:** Owning one island and contesting another provides a backdrop for a range of conflict-driven narratives and missions. The division of the second island could underscore the ongoing struggle and the high stakes of the civil war. # Gameplay and Narrative Integration - **Warsaw Pact Weapons:** The use of specific weapon types can define the combat style and strategy of the faction, with engagements likely favoring close to mid-range encounters. This choice also has historical implications, potentially tying the faction to external supporters or ideologies, enriching the game's geopolitical backdrop. - **Moral Ambiguities:** The mention of lynching as a common practice introduces a dark reality to aligning with or combating this faction. It opens up challenging ethical decisions for the player and can be used to explore themes of radicalization, justice, and resistance. It's crucial, however, to handle such sensitive topics with care, ensuring they are neither trivialized nor exploited for shock value. - **Missions and Influence:** Working with or against this faction could involve a variety of morally complex missions, from disrupting the former army's supply lines to influencing civilian allegiances. The player's actions could significantly impact the population's perception and resistance movements. # Ethical Considerations and Player Choices - **Ethical Impact:** The game can allow players to confront or contribute to the faction's more controversial practices, offering choices that can lead to different game endings or factions' fates. These decisions can significantly affect the player's standing not only with this faction but with others and civilian populations. - **Complex Alliances:** Aligning with this faction might offer unique strategic benefits, including access to guerrilla tactics, intelligence, and Warsaw Pact weaponry. However, it could also alienate other factions and civilians, affecting the player's ability to operate freely across the islands. By fleshing out the Far-Left Guerrilla faction in these ways, you can create a more immersive and morally complex game world that challenges players to think critically about their choices and their impact on the ongoing conflict. Through careful narrative design, you can explore the consequences of ideologies taken to extremes and the costs of civil war on both individuals and societies."},{"instruction":"The Cartel is holed up in a old city in the 5th island. They have coke and peyote farms. Their main weapons are American and some Mendoza guns. They often wear Hawaiian shirts. They are pretty chill with civilians as long as they don't snitch. One of their leaders' quotes is, \\"Terrorism... isn't that a popular word these days?\\"","output":"The Cartel presents an intriguing faction in your game, blending elements of danger, commerce, and a distinct cultural flavor against the backdrop of a civil war. Here's how you might expand upon this faction to fully integrate their character, operations, and relationships into the game's world: # Cultural and Visual Identity - **Visual Aesthetics:** The combination of Hawaiian shirts and a mix of American and Mendoza guns creates a unique visual identity that sets them apart from other factions. This aesthetic choice could communicate a deceptive laid-back attitude that belies their true danger and efficiency. - **Old City Stronghold:** Their base in an old city on the fifth island offers numerous opportunities for detailed world-building. Imagine narrow streets, hidden alleys, and a mix of historical architecture repurposed for the Cartel's activities. This setting can provide a rich environment for missions, offering both beauty and danger. # Gameplay Dynamics and Missions - **Economic Power:** Given their control over cocaine and peyote production, the Cartel could serve as a significant economic force within the game. Players might engage in missions related to the drug trade, either supporting, undermining, or exploiting the Cartel’s operations. - **Ambiguous Morality:** The Cartel's seemingly amiable relationship with civilians \\"as long as they don't snitch\\" introduces moral ambiguity. This stance could facilitate interesting gameplay dynamics where players need to navigate the delicate balance between utilizing the Cartel's resources and protecting innocent lives. - **Leader Philosophy:** The leader's casual remark on terrorism reflects a potential for deeper narrative exploration, highlighting the faction's nuanced perspective on violence, loyalty, and power. Dialogue and missions involving the Cartel's leaders can reveal complex characters that challenge players' preconceptions. # Interfactional Relationships - **Tenuous Alliances:** The Cartel's relatively neutral stance towards civilians and focus on their commercial interests could lead them to form alliances of convenience with any faction that benefits their operation, including possibly the player. However, these alliances might be fragile, threatened by shifting loyalties or external pressures. - **Conflict and Cooperation:** Missions could involve navigating the intricate web of relations between the Cartel and other factions. Players might play factions against each other, using the Cartel's economic influence to their advantage—or find themselves caught in the crossfire of a fragile truce gone wrong. # Ethical Considerations and Player Choices - **Moral Decision Making:** The game could present players with tough choices about how deeply to involve themselves with the Cartel’s operations. Missions could range from morally gray to outright illegal, with consequences affecting how civilians and other factions view the player. - **Impactful Consequences:** Players’ decisions regarding the Cartel could have visible impacts on the game world. For example, disrupting drug operations might lead to economic decline in areas dependent on the Cartel, while cooperation could see those areas flourish but at a moral cost. Integrating the Cartel with this combination of economic influence, cultural identity, and ambiguous morality adds a rich layer to the game's narrative. It challenges players to navigate a world where alliances are fluid, and actions have far-reaching consequences. Crafting a nuanced portrayal of the Cartel, mindful of the real-world implications of drug trade representation, will be essential for delivering a compelling and respectful narrative."},{"instruction":"The tribes of the 5 islands often live in small villages. Their main weapons range from Japanese to Soviet WW2 weapons. They wear pajamas, non-las, t-shirts and other baggy clothes. They are neutral to all factions, except for the Guerillas. High-Ranking members of the tribe often sport face paint. There are some adobe and stone buildings in their villages. Their currency is gold coins.","output":"The tribes of the five islands offer a fascinating layer to your game's world, introducing a rich cultural tapestry, historical depth, and unique societal structures. Here's how you can integrate and develop the tribes within the game's narrative and gameplay mechanics: # Cultural and Historical Depth - **Traditional Attire and Symbols:** Tribesmen wearing pajamas, non-las, t-shirts, and other baggy clothes, along with face paint for high-ranking members, create a vivid visual identity. This attire can signal their social structure, beliefs, and traditions. The game could include missions or interactions where understanding and respecting these customs plays a crucial role. - **Weapons and Warfare:** The choice of Japanese to Soviet WWII weapons indicates the tribes have been self-reliant and resourceful, scavenging and maintaining these arms over years. Encounters with the tribes could involve combat training or missions that emphasize guerilla tactics and clever use of the terrain, reflecting their historical resilience and ingenuity. - **Adobe and Stone Architecture:** Their villages, characterized by adobe and stone buildings, can provide unique environmental storytelling opportunities. Exploring these areas, players could learn about the tribes’ history, culture, and the secrets of the islands, possibly even uncovering hidden quests or treasures. # Gameplay Integration - **Neutral Stance & Faction Dynamics:** The tribes’ general neutrality offers an interesting dynamic in the factional conflict of the game. Players could be tasked with missions that involve negotiating with or protecting the tribes, potentially swaying their neutrality for strategic advantages or to safeguard them from harm. - **Tribal Economy:** The use of gold coins as currency within the tribes opens up unique economic gameplay elements. Players could engage in trade, leveraging the gold coins against the more modern or faction-specific currencies and resources. This trade system could also introduce quests related to the search for gold or protecting tribal mines. - **Relationship with the Guerillas:** The exception to the tribes’ neutrality — their opposition to the Guerillas — sets the stage for complex narrative arcs. Exploring the reasons behind this animosity could lead to missions that delve into the history of the islands and the origins of its conflicts. # Ethical Considerations and Player Impact - **Cultural Sensitivity and Impact:** When designing missions and interactions involving the tribes, it's essential to approach with sensitivity and respect for indigenous cultures. Consider the implications of the player's actions on these communities and strive to avoid perpetuating stereotypes. - **Consequences of Player Actions:** Actions taken by or on behalf of the tribes should have visible consequences in the game world. For example, successfully defending a village from guerrillas could lead to strengthened defenses or the revealing of ancient secrets. Conversely, failure or betrayal could result in the loss of trust, access to resources, or even the village itself. # Interactive and Dynamic World - **Dynamic Tribal Politics and Relationships:** The tribes' relationships with each other and with external factions could evolve based on player actions. Dynamic events, such as festivals, rituals, or conflicts, could offer players a deeper immersion into tribal cultures and influence the broader narrative landscape of the game. Creating the tribes with such detailed consideration not only enriches the world of your game but also provides a platform for players to engage with complex moral choices, strategic challenges, and deep, interactive storytelling. This approach can cultivate a game environment where every decision has weight, and the player's relationship with the world and its inhabitants evolves in meaningful ways."},{"instruction":"So far, for the MC, there are 4 endings: Leave the island with the diamonds, remain in the island to help other factions, become the leader of the islands and exploit its resources and THE SECRET ENDING... literally do the same thing Kurtz did in Apocalypse Now.","output":"Your ideas for the multiple endings craft a story with depth and player agency, ensuring the narrative not only responds to player choices but also offers significantly different outcomes that reflect the moral and strategic decisions made throughout the game. Here's a brief exploration and expansion on the endings you've proposed, aiming to integrate them smoothly into the game's structure and themes: # Ending 1: Leave the Island with the Diamonds - **Narrative Arc:** This ending caps a story of survival and perhaps cynicism, with the player character (PC) prioritizing self-interest or perhaps disillusionment with the conflict. To make it rewarding, the journey to this ending could involve complex moral choices and sacrifices, highlighting the costs of abandoning the islands and their inhabitants to ongoing conflict. - **Gameplay Implication:** Achieving this ending could involve gathering intelligence, negotiating with or outsmarting various factions, and securing a reliable escape route—all while securing the diamonds. This path might offer more stealth and strategy-oriented gameplay. # Ending 2: Remain on the Island to Help Other Factions - **Narrative Arc:** This ending reflects a commitment to the islands and their people, with the PC becoming a catalyst for change or stability. The player could choose which faction(s) to support, impacting the kind of help they provide—be it unifying the islands, ending the civil war, or bringing about a peace accord. - **Gameplay Implication:** Achieving this ending requires deep engagement with the game’s factions, completing key missions that sway the balance of power and influence the conflict’s outcome. It might also involve development projects, like rebuilding villages or initiating peace talks, which could open up unique gameplay segments. # Ending 3: Become the Leader of the Islands and Exploit Its Resources - **Narrative Arc:** This ending paints the PC as seizing power for personal gain, exploiting the islands’ resources. It’s a darker, perhaps more cynical narrative path, where the PC becomes what they might have fought against—a ruler prioritizing wealth and power over the welfare of the islands' inhabitants. - **Gameplay Implication:** Reaching this conclusion could involve forming alliances with the most powerful and ruthless factions, defeating or undermining competitors, and ultimately establishing control over key resources and territories. This path might engage players interested in strategy and empire-building gameplay mechanics. # SECRET ENDING: Emulate Kurtz from \\"Apocalypse Now\\" - **Narrative Arc:** Drawing inspiration from \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" this secretive ending could delve into themes of madness, power, and isolation, with the PC going rogue, possibly establishing a cult of personality around themselves or descending into nihilism. It’s a nuanced, morally complex conclusion that could explore the darkest aspects of human nature and the corrupting influence of absolute power. - **Gameplay Implication:** Achieving this ending might involve the PC undertaking morally ambiguous or outright dark actions, distancing themselves from all factions to carve out their own domain, possibly leading to a stand-off akin to the climax of \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" Exploration, psychological warfare, and maintaining control over followers could play significant roles in gameplay as the PC descends into a Kurtz-like existence. # Implementing the Endings For seamless integration, these endings should be clearly foreshadowed throughout the gameplay, allowing players to see the consequences of their choices as they edge closer to their chosen conclusion. Moral choices, alliances, and key decisions should all be framed within the context of these potential endings, providing players with a coherent narrative journey that culminates in a satisfying and impactful conclusion. Additionally, consider incorporating post-ending content or effects that reflect the chosen ending, further immersing players in the consequences of their decisions. This could include changes in the game world, how NPCs interact with the PC, or even access to unique missions or areas reflective of the ending's outcome. By providing such varied and meaningful conclusions, you significantly enhance the game's replay value and encourage players to explore different moral and strategic paths, deepening their engagement with the game world and its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following research paper: \\"\\"Intangible Value Executive Summary Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its failure to incorporate intangible assets, which play an increasingly crucial role in the modern economy. We consolidate our prior research to construct a firm-level measure of intangible value. We find that expanding intrinsic value to include intangibles can help restore value investing to its former glory. The Death of Value The building chorus of investors singing of the “death of value” has reached a crescendo. They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP 🚀 Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies’ intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table 🍽 🧂 Now that you’ve seen how the sausage is made, it’s time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let’s start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we’ll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies’ balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing’s value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke’s value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. 🦆 By now, you’ve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. The Death of (Tangible) Value Our hypothesis is that value investing has struggled due to the rise of intangible assets. Now that we have a quantitative measure of intangible value for each company, we can test this empirically. We will first divide our investment universe into two groups: intangible-rich companies (top quartile on intangible share) and everyone else. From here, we can run a traditional value investing strategy in each universe separately. The next exhibit shows that tangible value has continued to work reasonably well, as long as you avoid running it on high intangible companies. Not surprisingly, tangible value has been an ineffective tool for evaluating firms composed mainly of intangible assets. A classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole! Exhibit 14 Old Value in the New Economy Source: S&P, Sparkline. Blue line is performance of the traditional value factor in a universe consisting of the top quartile of the top 1000 largest U.S. firms on intangible share. Red line is the same but in a universe of all other stocks. The traditional value factor is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quartiles of stocks on price to book, earnings, sales, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). We exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. In Value Investing Is Short Tech Disruption (Aug 2020), we argued that value investors have struggled due to an implicit (losing) bet against disruptive technology. We now see that the “short disruption” bet is part of a broader bet against intangibles in general (of which innovation is but one pillar). 7 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The good news is that traditional value investing still works as long as you only invest in companies for which tangible value still matters. The bad news is that the universe of companies for which tangible value still matters is steadily and irrevocably shrinking! Fixing Fama-French Of course, there’s no reason to restrict ourselves to tangible value when we now have a metric that also includes intangible value. If built correctly, our intangible-aware intrinsic value metric should be able to find cheap stocks in both high- and low-intangible universes. Our first step is to define a baseline “Tangible Value” factor. We use the value factor defined by Fama and French, given the paper’s lofty status as the canonical academic work on quantitative value. Fama and French use book value as their measure of intrinsic value. They build a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of stocks on price-to-book. We use the market cap weighted version of their strategy to reduce the risk of deceptive results from illiquid small-caps. Exhibit 15 You Hate to See It 🙈 Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Fama and French exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The historical performance of Tangible Value reflects the tribulations of many value managers. After many decades of consistent outperformance of +5.4% annualized, Tangible Value has floundered over the past decade. Even after the rebound from the recent Covid-reopening rally, it would have to climb a further +280% to get back to trend. Now that we have established a baseline, we next want to evaluate the impact of augmenting this baseline with a measure of intangible value. We will test two different approaches to quantifying intangibles. First, we build a “GAAP Intangible Value” factor that augments book value by adding intangibles derived from capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A found in GAAP income statements (per Lev and Gu). Second, we create an “Intangible Value” factor that uses our definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. Importantly, this factor goes beyond accounting data to use measures of intangibles extracted from unstructured data using NLP. The next exhibit focuses on the past decade, which is the period during which traditional value has struggled. We find that GAAP-derived intangible assets were only marginally helpful. The real improvement comes once we unlock the power of non-accounting, unstructured data. Exhibit 16 Intangible Improvements Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). GAAP Intangible Value is the same except it adds capitalized R&D and SG&A to book value. Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama and French. From 12/31/2009 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. 8 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Finally, let’s put it all together. We find that, while Tangible Value has decayed with the declining relevance of tangible assets, Intangible Value has continued to perform in line with value’s long-term historical trend. Exhibit 17 O Drawdown, Where Art Thou? Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. Dissecting the Portfolio The previous section analyzed the performance of the “value factor,” which is a long-short strategy. We’ll now examine a long-only version. This is basically just the long side of the Intangible Value factor with a few modifications. We start with the U.S. large- and mid-cap investment universe (roughly the Russell 1000). We rank each stock on our intangible-augmented value score and buy the cheapest 150 stocks. Within these stocks, we allocate more weight to stocks with higher scores and, to increase portfolio liquidity, market capitalization. For ease of exposition, we will call this the Intangible Value “portfolio” (opposed to “factor”). The next exhibit shows the top ten holdings of the Intangible Value portfolio. For context, we also include stocks in the top ten of the S&P 500 but not in the Intangible Value portfolio. Exhibit 18 Top Holdings Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. As of 5/28/2021. At first blush, the very top of the portfolio doesn’t look too exciting. This is due in large part to the unique situation today where the largest companies also happen to be among the most intangible-rich. As discussed in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020), firms like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are digital monopolies that use intangibles to create wide moats, enabling them to sustain high growth rates at a historically unprecedented scale. That said, we still notice some important differences, especially compared to Russell 1000 Value and Growth. Value has nearly zero exposure to Big Tech, while Growth has a massive 36% position. Further, the Intangible Value portfolio does not have any Tesla or Visa or Berkshire, J&J, or JPMorgan, although they are among the largest holdings of these three indices. As you go down to the bottom 140 positions, the names and, more importantly, weights diverge further. Rather than show all positions, we will analyze the portfolio on the aggregate dimensions of industry and style factors. We will first look at industry group exposure. 9 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 19 Industry Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. The blue text highlights the top 5 industry groups for each portfolio. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio has a large allocation to the stocks most central to the modern knowledge economy: software, hardware, pharma, media and semiconductors. In contrast, traditional value has a hard time bringing itself to buy companies composed of intangible assets. This results in a portfolio concentrated in old-economy industries such as capital goods, banks, and financials. We will next break out the factor lens 🔍 . We calculate the aggregate exposure of each portfolio to both traditional “style factors” and custom intangible factors. Exhibit 20 Factor Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, USPTO, Sparkline. Earnings, book, sales, R&D, S&M, and patents are calculated over a trailing 12-month window. Patents and PhDs are scaled by billions (e.g., # patents per 1 billion market cap). Patents are from USPTO. S&M is sales and marketing expenditures. Platforms are based on metric defined in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020). Expected Growth is consensus analyst expected long-term growth of earnings per share. All calculations are weighted averages with weights equal to portfolio position size. As of 5/28/2021. On traditional metrics (i.e., size, value, growth, profitability), the Intangible Value portfolio has a profile similar to the S&P 500 and between that of traditional value and growth. However, it has a much greater exposure to intangible assets. Each dollar invested in the Intangible Value portfolio buys around twice the quantity of R&D, marketing, patents and PhDs compared to a dollar invested in the S&P 500. While this is somewhat by design, it is useful to see that this advantage doesn’t come at the cost of materially worse valuation ratios, growth or profitability. Finally, we backtest the performance again to make sure nothing was lost in translation from the long-short factor. This time we’ll add simulated transaction costs and 50 bps of fees and expenses to make the backtest more realistic. Exhibit 21 Intangible Value Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Intangible Value is a long-only portfolio of the top 150 stocks from within the top 1000 U.S. stocks on intangible value score, weighted by score and modified market cap. We simulate transaction costs and include 50 bps of fees and expenses. S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Russell 1000 Growth are (uninvestable) index returns. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. We find that the Intangible Value portfolio would have outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, despite currently having factor exposures in between those of Russell 1000 Value and Growth, it would have also outperformed both. 10 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Think Outside the Style Box 📦 Style Boxed In As quantitative managers, we have benefited professionally from the rising tide of factor-based investing. However, we believe that the “factorization” of the investment industry has at this point reached an excessive level and is now actually contributing to its stagnation. As the investment industry has become institutionalized, active managers have been forced into so-called “style boxes.” Popularized by Morningstar, this framework divides the world into a two-dimensional matrix based on value vs. growth and large vs. small cap. Exhibit 22 Style Boxes Source: Morningstar, Sparkline The style box framework defines value and growth as diametric opposites. According to this framework, in the same way that a stock can’t be both small and large, it can’t be both value and growth. Managers are expected to pick an allegiance to one box and only one box. Traitors who step out of their lane are summarily fired for “style drift!” ☠️ Joined at the Hip We believe that the style box orthodoxy has shackled managers to an obsolete formulation of value and stifled attempts to expand the definition of value to that which is relevant today. In fact, we are not alone in this thinking. Warren Buffett addressed this topic decisively: “... there is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks, the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes. … anybody that tells you, ‘You ought to have your money in growth stocks or value stocks,’ really does not understand investing. … And I just cringe when I hear people talk about, ‘Now it’s time to move from growth stocks to value stocks,’ or something like that, because it just doesn’t make any sense.” Instead, he advocated: “Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ‘value’ and ‘growth.’ Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking ... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.” Buffett understands that the style box portrayal of value as being necessarily short growth is ridiculous. Value and growth are not mutually-exclusive. Companies with wide intangible moats can be both growth and value. Just because one identifies as a value investor doesn’t mean he has to restrict himself to buying only 💩 -cos! Value investing (in a philosophical sense) simply means buying stocks below intrinsic value. And intrinsic value absolutely should take into account firms' growth prospects! Beyond Style Boxes We believe the Intangible Value portfolio provides a purer expression of “Grahamian” value than does style box value. Its style box categorization will be merely incidental to the opportunity set available at the time. If cheap stocks happen to be found mostly among old-economy, asset-heavy firms, the strategy will be labeled “value.” If the best opportunities tend to be in high-growth, asset-light compounders, it will be considered “growth.” Exhibit 23 shows the correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio to the value and growth style boxes over time. 11 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 23 Shifting Style Boxes Source: S&P, Sparkline. Style Box Value is a blend of price to book, sales, earnings, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). Style Box Growth is analysts’ consensus forecast long-term growth in EPS. Lines display cross-sectional position-level correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio with the above. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio’s style box exposure has evolved significantly over time. In the late 1990s, it was both staunchly “pro-value” and “anti-growth,” betting heavily against unprofitable, speculative dot-com stocks. In this period, many stocks with no intrinsic value ended up getting bid up based on fantastic growth expectations. In order to avoid these companies, the portfolio held large positions in industrials, utilities, and materials. This positioning helped avoid much of the losses from the burst of the dot-com bubble. In contrast, the S&P 500, due to its cap weighting scheme, mechanically increased its tech exposure from 5% to 35% as valuations surged in the 1990s, only to suffer when the bubble subsequently burst. However, as the world has become increasingly intangible, tangible value has become a much less useful metric. Over this period, many traditional “style box value” managers suffered from large implicit bets against innovative, information-era firms. By not shackling itself to the value style box, the Intangible Value portfolio was free to rotate toward these modern, intangible-rich firms. The freedom to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing opportunity set is an important benefit of “thinking outside the style box.” Today, the Intangible Value portfolio actually has a small positive exposure to both style box value and growth. After all, it’s 2021, and there’s nothing wrong with a little “intellectual cross-dressing!” 👘 Uniting the Tribes ⚔️ For many years, the moral superiority of value investing was dogma, but value’s recent stumbles have created a power vacuum in the investment world. This has opened the door for a bevy of contenders for the throne, such as thematic and memetic investors, who pay little mind to valuation. More importantly, many investors no longer seek “growth at a reasonable price” but simply “growth at any price.” This is a natural response to a long, raging bull market fueled by low rates and aggressive stimulus. However, signs of froth are emerging in many segments of the market, if not also the market as a whole. And, as we saw in the dot-com bubble, investing without a margin of safety can be perilous! On the other hand, growth investors kind of have a point. Traditional value portfolios do seem junkier than in the past. Ignoring intangible assets biases value investors toward stagnant firms in old-economy sectors like financials, industrials, energy, utilities, and materials. Concerningly, these portfolios are increasingly concentrated in low margin, cyclical, and commodity businesses. Lacking a reasonable alternative, the investment world has been cleaved into two warring factions. Both sides have dug in their heels, contributing to unhealthy polarization. Their positions are increasingly disjoint (e.g., 2% big tech ownership by Russell 1000 Value and 36% for Growth). The constant tug-of-war between the two camps is contributing to market instability in the form of the massive value-growth rotations we have experienced over the past several months. We believe that investors have a third option, which avoids having to make this false choice between “growth” and “value”. A more holistic definition of intrinsic value should produce an acceptable framework for both factions. This should allow investors to incorporate the intangibles that drive growth in the present day, while still keeping an eye on valuations. By giving companies credit for their intangible assets, we believe investors can own high-quality, modern portfolios without abandoning the value paradigm. 12 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Conclusion Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its omission of intangibles, which are becoming the dominant form of value in the information economy. We show that adding intangible value to the traditional definition of intrinsic value would have helped value avoid its recent travails. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value Measuring intangibles can be challenging. Due to the many limitations of structured accounting data, investors must seek out alternative data sources in their quest to quantify intangibles. Since these datasets are generally unstructured, investors must equip themselves with modern NLP tools. We believe value investing has a bright future if we can break the style box orthodoxy and embrace a more modern conception of value. We are fortunate that the digital age has armed us with powerful new data and tools for this grand adventure. Let’s get value investing back on track!

Kai Wu from Sparkline Capital highlights how traditional value investing, which focuses on tangible assets, has struggled in recent years due to its failure to account for the growing importance of intangible assets like intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. The paper argues for an expanded definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible assets and presents a method for quantifying intangible assets using machine learning and alternative, non-standard financial data. Key Points: - The decline in traditional value investing's effectiveness is attributed to the increasing significance of intangible assets in companies' valuation, which are not adequately captured in traditional financial metrics. - The paper suggests that incorporating intangibles into the calculation of a company's intrinsic value could revitalize value investing. - It detailed Warren Buffett's investment journey as a case study of evolving investment strategies to include more emphasis on intangible assets. - The transformation from an industrial to an information-based economy has made traditional accounting metrics, focused on tangible assets, less relevant. - The researchers created a firm-level measure of intangible value and demonstrated through backtesting that a value strategy incorporating intangibles significantly outperforms traditional methods, particularly over the past decade where traditional value investing underperformed. Conclusion: The paper concludes that modernizing value investing to account for intangible assets can restore its effectiveness. By doing so, investors can identify undervalued companies in today’s intangible-heavy economy, thus uniting the principles of growth and value investing. The presented research emphasizes the need for value investors to adapt to the changing landscape of asset valuation by utilizing new data sources and analytical techniques."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following research paper: \\"\\"Intangible Value Executive Summary Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its failure to incorporate intangible assets, which play an increasingly crucial role in the modern economy. We consolidate our prior research to construct a firm-level measure of intangible value. We find that expanding intrinsic value to include intangibles can help restore value investing to its former glory. The Death of Value The building chorus of investors singing of the “death of value” has reached a crescendo. They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP 🚀 Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies’ intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table 🍽 🧂 Now that you’ve seen how the sausage is made, it’s time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let’s start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we’ll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies’ balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing’s value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke’s value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. 🦆 By now, you’ve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. The Death of (Tangible) Value Our hypothesis is that value investing has struggled due to the rise of intangible assets. Now that we have a quantitative measure of intangible value for each company, we can test this empirically. We will first divide our investment universe into two groups: intangible-rich companies (top quartile on intangible share) and everyone else. From here, we can run a traditional value investing strategy in each universe separately. The next exhibit shows that tangible value has continued to work reasonably well, as long as you avoid running it on high intangible companies. Not surprisingly, tangible value has been an ineffective tool for evaluating firms composed mainly of intangible assets. A classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole! Exhibit 14 Old Value in the New Economy Source: S&P, Sparkline. Blue line is performance of the traditional value factor in a universe consisting of the top quartile of the top 1000 largest U.S. firms on intangible share. Red line is the same but in a universe of all other stocks. The traditional value factor is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quartiles of stocks on price to book, earnings, sales, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). We exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. In Value Investing Is Short Tech Disruption (Aug 2020), we argued that value investors have struggled due to an implicit (losing) bet against disruptive technology. We now see that the “short disruption” bet is part of a broader bet against intangibles in general (of which innovation is but one pillar). 7 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The good news is that traditional value investing still works as long as you only invest in companies for which tangible value still matters. The bad news is that the universe of companies for which tangible value still matters is steadily and irrevocably shrinking! Fixing Fama-French Of course, there’s no reason to restrict ourselves to tangible value when we now have a metric that also includes intangible value. If built correctly, our intangible-aware intrinsic value metric should be able to find cheap stocks in both high- and low-intangible universes. Our first step is to define a baseline “Tangible Value” factor. We use the value factor defined by Fama and French, given the paper’s lofty status as the canonical academic work on quantitative value. Fama and French use book value as their measure of intrinsic value. They build a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of stocks on price-to-book. We use the market cap weighted version of their strategy to reduce the risk of deceptive results from illiquid small-caps. Exhibit 15 You Hate to See It 🙈 Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Fama and French exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The historical performance of Tangible Value reflects the tribulations of many value managers. After many decades of consistent outperformance of +5.4% annualized, Tangible Value has floundered over the past decade. Even after the rebound from the recent Covid-reopening rally, it would have to climb a further +280% to get back to trend. Now that we have established a baseline, we next want to evaluate the impact of augmenting this baseline with a measure of intangible value. We will test two different approaches to quantifying intangibles. First, we build a “GAAP Intangible Value” factor that augments book value by adding intangibles derived from capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A found in GAAP income statements (per Lev and Gu). Second, we create an “Intangible Value” factor that uses our definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. Importantly, this factor goes beyond accounting data to use measures of intangibles extracted from unstructured data using NLP. The next exhibit focuses on the past decade, which is the period during which traditional value has struggled. We find that GAAP-derived intangible assets were only marginally helpful. The real improvement comes once we unlock the power of non-accounting, unstructured data. Exhibit 16 Intangible Improvements Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). GAAP Intangible Value is the same except it adds capitalized R&D and SG&A to book value. Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama and French. From 12/31/2009 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. 8 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Finally, let’s put it all together. We find that, while Tangible Value has decayed with the declining relevance of tangible assets, Intangible Value has continued to perform in line with value’s long-term historical trend. Exhibit 17 O Drawdown, Where Art Thou? Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. Dissecting the Portfolio The previous section analyzed the performance of the “value factor,” which is a long-short strategy. We’ll now examine a long-only version. This is basically just the long side of the Intangible Value factor with a few modifications. We start with the U.S. large- and mid-cap investment universe (roughly the Russell 1000). We rank each stock on our intangible-augmented value score and buy the cheapest 150 stocks. Within these stocks, we allocate more weight to stocks with higher scores and, to increase portfolio liquidity, market capitalization. For ease of exposition, we will call this the Intangible Value “portfolio” (opposed to “factor”). The next exhibit shows the top ten holdings of the Intangible Value portfolio. For context, we also include stocks in the top ten of the S&P 500 but not in the Intangible Value portfolio. Exhibit 18 Top Holdings Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. As of 5/28/2021. At first blush, the very top of the portfolio doesn’t look too exciting. This is due in large part to the unique situation today where the largest companies also happen to be among the most intangible-rich. As discussed in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020), firms like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are digital monopolies that use intangibles to create wide moats, enabling them to sustain high growth rates at a historically unprecedented scale. That said, we still notice some important differences, especially compared to Russell 1000 Value and Growth. Value has nearly zero exposure to Big Tech, while Growth has a massive 36% position. Further, the Intangible Value portfolio does not have any Tesla or Visa or Berkshire, J&J, or JPMorgan, although they are among the largest holdings of these three indices. As you go down to the bottom 140 positions, the names and, more importantly, weights diverge further. Rather than show all positions, we will analyze the portfolio on the aggregate dimensions of industry and style factors. We will first look at industry group exposure. 9 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 19 Industry Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. The blue text highlights the top 5 industry groups for each portfolio. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio has a large allocation to the stocks most central to the modern knowledge economy: software, hardware, pharma, media and semiconductors. In contrast, traditional value has a hard time bringing itself to buy companies composed of intangible assets. This results in a portfolio concentrated in old-economy industries such as capital goods, banks, and financials. We will next break out the factor lens 🔍 . We calculate the aggregate exposure of each portfolio to both traditional “style factors” and custom intangible factors. Exhibit 20 Factor Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, USPTO, Sparkline. Earnings, book, sales, R&D, S&M, and patents are calculated over a trailing 12-month window. Patents and PhDs are scaled by billions (e.g., # patents per 1 billion market cap). Patents are from USPTO. S&M is sales and marketing expenditures. Platforms are based on metric defined in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020). Expected Growth is consensus analyst expected long-term growth of earnings per share. All calculations are weighted averages with weights equal to portfolio position size. As of 5/28/2021. On traditional metrics (i.e., size, value, growth, profitability), the Intangible Value portfolio has a profile similar to the S&P 500 and between that of traditional value and growth. However, it has a much greater exposure to intangible assets. Each dollar invested in the Intangible Value portfolio buys around twice the quantity of R&D, marketing, patents and PhDs compared to a dollar invested in the S&P 500. While this is somewhat by design, it is useful to see that this advantage doesn’t come at the cost of materially worse valuation ratios, growth or profitability. Finally, we backtest the performance again to make sure nothing was lost in translation from the long-short factor. This time we’ll add simulated transaction costs and 50 bps of fees and expenses to make the backtest more realistic. Exhibit 21 Intangible Value Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Intangible Value is a long-only portfolio of the top 150 stocks from within the top 1000 U.S. stocks on intangible value score, weighted by score and modified market cap. We simulate transaction costs and include 50 bps of fees and expenses. S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Russell 1000 Growth are (uninvestable) index returns. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. We find that the Intangible Value portfolio would have outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, despite currently having factor exposures in between those of Russell 1000 Value and Growth, it would have also outperformed both. 10 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Think Outside the Style Box 📦 Style Boxed In As quantitative managers, we have benefited professionally from the rising tide of factor-based investing. However, we believe that the “factorization” of the investment industry has at this point reached an excessive level and is now actually contributing to its stagnation. As the investment industry has become institutionalized, active managers have been forced into so-called “style boxes.” Popularized by Morningstar, this framework divides the world into a two-dimensional matrix based on value vs. growth and large vs. small cap. Exhibit 22 Style Boxes Source: Morningstar, Sparkline The style box framework defines value and growth as diametric opposites. According to this framework, in the same way that a stock can’t be both small and large, it can’t be both value and growth. Managers are expected to pick an allegiance to one box and only one box. Traitors who step out of their lane are summarily fired for “style drift!” ☠️ Joined at the Hip We believe that the style box orthodoxy has shackled managers to an obsolete formulation of value and stifled attempts to expand the definition of value to that which is relevant today. In fact, we are not alone in this thinking. Warren Buffett addressed this topic decisively: “... there is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks, the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes. … anybody that tells you, ‘You ought to have your money in growth stocks or value stocks,’ really does not understand investing. … And I just cringe when I hear people talk about, ‘Now it’s time to move from growth stocks to value stocks,’ or something like that, because it just doesn’t make any sense.” Instead, he advocated: “Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ‘value’ and ‘growth.’ Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking ... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.” Buffett understands that the style box portrayal of value as being necessarily short growth is ridiculous. Value and growth are not mutually-exclusive. Companies with wide intangible moats can be both growth and value. Just because one identifies as a value investor doesn’t mean he has to restrict himself to buying only 💩 -cos! Value investing (in a philosophical sense) simply means buying stocks below intrinsic value. And intrinsic value absolutely should take into account firms' growth prospects! Beyond Style Boxes We believe the Intangible Value portfolio provides a purer expression of “Grahamian” value than does style box value. Its style box categorization will be merely incidental to the opportunity set available at the time. If cheap stocks happen to be found mostly among old-economy, asset-heavy firms, the strategy will be labeled “value.” If the best opportunities tend to be in high-growth, asset-light compounders, it will be considered “growth.” Exhibit 23 shows the correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio to the value and growth style boxes over time. 11 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 23 Shifting Style Boxes Source: S&P, Sparkline. Style Box Value is a blend of price to book, sales, earnings, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). Style Box Growth is analysts’ consensus forecast long-term growth in EPS. Lines display cross-sectional position-level correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio with the above. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio’s style box exposure has evolved significantly over time. In the late 1990s, it was both staunchly “pro-value” and “anti-growth,” betting heavily against unprofitable, speculative dot-com stocks. In this period, many stocks with no intrinsic value ended up getting bid up based on fantastic growth expectations. In order to avoid these companies, the portfolio held large positions in industrials, utilities, and materials. This positioning helped avoid much of the losses from the burst of the dot-com bubble. In contrast, the S&P 500, due to its cap weighting scheme, mechanically increased its tech exposure from 5% to 35% as valuations surged in the 1990s, only to suffer when the bubble subsequently burst. However, as the world has become increasingly intangible, tangible value has become a much less useful metric. Over this period, many traditional “style box value” managers suffered from large implicit bets against innovative, information-era firms. By not shackling itself to the value style box, the Intangible Value portfolio was free to rotate toward these modern, intangible-rich firms. The freedom to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing opportunity set is an important benefit of “thinking outside the style box.” Today, the Intangible Value portfolio actually has a small positive exposure to both style box value and growth. After all, it’s 2021, and there’s nothing wrong with a little “intellectual cross-dressing!” 👘 Uniting the Tribes ⚔️ For many years, the moral superiority of value investing was dogma, but value’s recent stumbles have created a power vacuum in the investment world. This has opened the door for a bevy of contenders for the throne, such as thematic and memetic investors, who pay little mind to valuation. More importantly, many investors no longer seek “growth at a reasonable price” but simply “growth at any price.” This is a natural response to a long, raging bull market fueled by low rates and aggressive stimulus. However, signs of froth are emerging in many segments of the market, if not also the market as a whole. And, as we saw in the dot-com bubble, investing without a margin of safety can be perilous! On the other hand, growth investors kind of have a point. Traditional value portfolios do seem junkier than in the past. Ignoring intangible assets biases value investors toward stagnant firms in old-economy sectors like financials, industrials, energy, utilities, and materials. Concerningly, these portfolios are increasingly concentrated in low margin, cyclical, and commodity businesses. Lacking a reasonable alternative, the investment world has been cleaved into two warring factions. Both sides have dug in their heels, contributing to unhealthy polarization. Their positions are increasingly disjoint (e.g., 2% big tech ownership by Russell 1000 Value and 36% for Growth). The constant tug-of-war between the two camps is contributing to market instability in the form of the massive value-growth rotations we have experienced over the past several months. We believe that investors have a third option, which avoids having to make this false choice between “growth” and “value”. A more holistic definition of intrinsic value should produce an acceptable framework for both factions. This should allow investors to incorporate the intangibles that drive growth in the present day, while still keeping an eye on valuations. By giving companies credit for their intangible assets, we believe investors can own high-quality, modern portfolios without abandoning the value paradigm. 12 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Conclusion Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its omission of intangibles, which are becoming the dominant form of value in the information economy. We show that adding intangible value to the traditional definition of intrinsic value would have helped value avoid its recent travails. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value Measuring intangibles can be challenging. Due to the many limitations of structured accounting data, investors must seek out alternative data sources in their quest to quantify intangibles. Since these datasets are generally unstructured, investors must equip themselves with modern NLP tools. We believe value investing has a bright future if we can break the style box orthodoxy and embrace a more modern conception of value. We are fortunate that the digital age has armed us with powerful new data and tools for this grand adventure. Let’s get value investing back on track!

Wu argues that the failure to account for intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects, has contributed to the underperformance of value investing in the modern, information-based economy. The paper begins by discussing the historical context of value investing, established by Ben Graham during the industrial age, when intrinsic value was largely tangible. However, with the economy's shift towards intangible-dominant industries, such as technology and healthcare, the paper suggests that traditional metrics for assessing intrinsic value, which focus primarily on tangible assets, are no longer sufficient. Wu highlights the \\"death of value\\" narrative among investors and points out that value investing is not dead but rather needs an update to include intangible values. By expanding the concept of intrinsic value to encompass intangible assets, value investing can regain its efficacy. The paper emphasizes the challenges of quantifying intangibles due to the lack of standardized accounting measures and introduces a novel approach using machine learning and alternative data to estimate a firm's intangible value. Notably, the research demonstrates through backtests that incorporating intangible value alongside traditional metrics significantly improves the performance of value investing strategies, particularly over the past decade when traditional value strategies have struggled. Warren Buffett's investment journey is cited as an illustration of how successful investors have adapted their strategies to focus on intangible assets. The economic transformation from industrial to asset-light, dominated by intangible-rich companies, necessitates a rethinking of investment approaches. The paper criticizes the rigid \\"style box\\" categorization that pits value against growth investing and argues for a more holistic view that recognizes intangible assets as crucial components of intrinsic value. By moving beyond style boxes and embracing intangibles, investors can construct more relevant and high-performing portfolios in the modern economy. In conclusion, \\"Intangible Value\\" calls for an evolution in value investing that acknowledges the growing importance of intangible assets. Kai Wu's research provides a blueprint for adapting value investing to the intangible economy, leveraging advanced data analysis techniques to uncover undervalued companies based on a more comprehensive assessment of their intrinsic value."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following research paper: \\"\\"Intangible Value Executive Summary Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its failure to incorporate intangible assets, which play an increasingly crucial role in the modern economy. We consolidate our prior research to construct a firm-level measure of intangible value. We find that expanding intrinsic value to include intangibles can help restore value investing to its former glory. The Death of Value The building chorus of investors singing of the “death of value” has reached a crescendo. They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP 🚀 Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies’ intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table 🍽 🧂 Now that you’ve seen how the sausage is made, it’s time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let’s start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we’ll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies’ balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing’s value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke’s value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. 🦆 By now, you’ve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. The Death of (Tangible) Value Our hypothesis is that value investing has struggled due to the rise of intangible assets. Now that we have a quantitative measure of intangible value for each company, we can test this empirically. We will first divide our investment universe into two groups: intangible-rich companies (top quartile on intangible share) and everyone else. From here, we can run a traditional value investing strategy in each universe separately. The next exhibit shows that tangible value has continued to work reasonably well, as long as you avoid running it on high intangible companies. Not surprisingly, tangible value has been an ineffective tool for evaluating firms composed mainly of intangible assets. A classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole! Exhibit 14 Old Value in the New Economy Source: S&P, Sparkline. Blue line is performance of the traditional value factor in a universe consisting of the top quartile of the top 1000 largest U.S. firms on intangible share. Red line is the same but in a universe of all other stocks. The traditional value factor is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quartiles of stocks on price to book, earnings, sales, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). We exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. In Value Investing Is Short Tech Disruption (Aug 2020), we argued that value investors have struggled due to an implicit (losing) bet against disruptive technology. We now see that the “short disruption” bet is part of a broader bet against intangibles in general (of which innovation is but one pillar). 7 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The good news is that traditional value investing still works as long as you only invest in companies for which tangible value still matters. The bad news is that the universe of companies for which tangible value still matters is steadily and irrevocably shrinking! Fixing Fama-French Of course, there’s no reason to restrict ourselves to tangible value when we now have a metric that also includes intangible value. If built correctly, our intangible-aware intrinsic value metric should be able to find cheap stocks in both high- and low-intangible universes. Our first step is to define a baseline “Tangible Value” factor. We use the value factor defined by Fama and French, given the paper’s lofty status as the canonical academic work on quantitative value. Fama and French use book value as their measure of intrinsic value. They build a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of stocks on price-to-book. We use the market cap weighted version of their strategy to reduce the risk of deceptive results from illiquid small-caps. Exhibit 15 You Hate to See It 🙈 Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Fama and French exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The historical performance of Tangible Value reflects the tribulations of many value managers. After many decades of consistent outperformance of +5.4% annualized, Tangible Value has floundered over the past decade. Even after the rebound from the recent Covid-reopening rally, it would have to climb a further +280% to get back to trend. Now that we have established a baseline, we next want to evaluate the impact of augmenting this baseline with a measure of intangible value. We will test two different approaches to quantifying intangibles. First, we build a “GAAP Intangible Value” factor that augments book value by adding intangibles derived from capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A found in GAAP income statements (per Lev and Gu). Second, we create an “Intangible Value” factor that uses our definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. Importantly, this factor goes beyond accounting data to use measures of intangibles extracted from unstructured data using NLP. The next exhibit focuses on the past decade, which is the period during which traditional value has struggled. We find that GAAP-derived intangible assets were only marginally helpful. The real improvement comes once we unlock the power of non-accounting, unstructured data. Exhibit 16 Intangible Improvements Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). GAAP Intangible Value is the same except it adds capitalized R&D and SG&A to book value. Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama and French. From 12/31/2009 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. 8 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Finally, let’s put it all together. We find that, while Tangible Value has decayed with the declining relevance of tangible assets, Intangible Value has continued to perform in line with value’s long-term historical trend. Exhibit 17 O Drawdown, Where Art Thou? Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. Dissecting the Portfolio The previous section analyzed the performance of the “value factor,” which is a long-short strategy. We’ll now examine a long-only version. This is basically just the long side of the Intangible Value factor with a few modifications. We start with the U.S. large- and mid-cap investment universe (roughly the Russell 1000). We rank each stock on our intangible-augmented value score and buy the cheapest 150 stocks. Within these stocks, we allocate more weight to stocks with higher scores and, to increase portfolio liquidity, market capitalization. For ease of exposition, we will call this the Intangible Value “portfolio” (opposed to “factor”). The next exhibit shows the top ten holdings of the Intangible Value portfolio. For context, we also include stocks in the top ten of the S&P 500 but not in the Intangible Value portfolio. Exhibit 18 Top Holdings Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. As of 5/28/2021. At first blush, the very top of the portfolio doesn’t look too exciting. This is due in large part to the unique situation today where the largest companies also happen to be among the most intangible-rich. As discussed in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020), firms like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are digital monopolies that use intangibles to create wide moats, enabling them to sustain high growth rates at a historically unprecedented scale. That said, we still notice some important differences, especially compared to Russell 1000 Value and Growth. Value has nearly zero exposure to Big Tech, while Growth has a massive 36% position. Further, the Intangible Value portfolio does not have any Tesla or Visa or Berkshire, J&J, or JPMorgan, although they are among the largest holdings of these three indices. As you go down to the bottom 140 positions, the names and, more importantly, weights diverge further. Rather than show all positions, we will analyze the portfolio on the aggregate dimensions of industry and style factors. We will first look at industry group exposure. 9 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 19 Industry Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. The blue text highlights the top 5 industry groups for each portfolio. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio has a large allocation to the stocks most central to the modern knowledge economy: software, hardware, pharma, media and semiconductors. In contrast, traditional value has a hard time bringing itself to buy companies composed of intangible assets. This results in a portfolio concentrated in old-economy industries such as capital goods, banks, and financials. We will next break out the factor lens 🔍 . We calculate the aggregate exposure of each portfolio to both traditional “style factors” and custom intangible factors. Exhibit 20 Factor Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, USPTO, Sparkline. Earnings, book, sales, R&D, S&M, and patents are calculated over a trailing 12-month window. Patents and PhDs are scaled by billions (e.g., # patents per 1 billion market cap). Patents are from USPTO. S&M is sales and marketing expenditures. Platforms are based on metric defined in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020). Expected Growth is consensus analyst expected long-term growth of earnings per share. All calculations are weighted averages with weights equal to portfolio position size. As of 5/28/2021. On traditional metrics (i.e., size, value, growth, profitability), the Intangible Value portfolio has a profile similar to the S&P 500 and between that of traditional value and growth. However, it has a much greater exposure to intangible assets. Each dollar invested in the Intangible Value portfolio buys around twice the quantity of R&D, marketing, patents and PhDs compared to a dollar invested in the S&P 500. While this is somewhat by design, it is useful to see that this advantage doesn’t come at the cost of materially worse valuation ratios, growth or profitability. Finally, we backtest the performance again to make sure nothing was lost in translation from the long-short factor. This time we’ll add simulated transaction costs and 50 bps of fees and expenses to make the backtest more realistic. Exhibit 21 Intangible Value Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Intangible Value is a long-only portfolio of the top 150 stocks from within the top 1000 U.S. stocks on intangible value score, weighted by score and modified market cap. We simulate transaction costs and include 50 bps of fees and expenses. S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Russell 1000 Growth are (uninvestable) index returns. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. We find that the Intangible Value portfolio would have outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, despite currently having factor exposures in between those of Russell 1000 Value and Growth, it would have also outperformed both. 10 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Think Outside the Style Box 📦 Style Boxed In As quantitative managers, we have benefited professionally from the rising tide of factor-based investing. However, we believe that the “factorization” of the investment industry has at this point reached an excessive level and is now actually contributing to its stagnation. As the investment industry has become institutionalized, active managers have been forced into so-called “style boxes.” Popularized by Morningstar, this framework divides the world into a two-dimensional matrix based on value vs. growth and large vs. small cap. Exhibit 22 Style Boxes Source: Morningstar, Sparkline The style box framework defines value and growth as diametric opposites. According to this framework, in the same way that a stock can’t be both small and large, it can’t be both value and growth. Managers are expected to pick an allegiance to one box and only one box. Traitors who step out of their lane are summarily fired for “style drift!” ☠️ Joined at the Hip We believe that the style box orthodoxy has shackled managers to an obsolete formulation of value and stifled attempts to expand the definition of value to that which is relevant today. In fact, we are not alone in this thinking. Warren Buffett addressed this topic decisively: “... there is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks, the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes. … anybody that tells you, ‘You ought to have your money in growth stocks or value stocks,’ really does not understand investing. … And I just cringe when I hear people talk about, ‘Now it’s time to move from growth stocks to value stocks,’ or something like that, because it just doesn’t make any sense.” Instead, he advocated: “Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ‘value’ and ‘growth.’ Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking ... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.” Buffett understands that the style box portrayal of value as being necessarily short growth is ridiculous. Value and growth are not mutually-exclusive. Companies with wide intangible moats can be both growth and value. Just because one identifies as a value investor doesn’t mean he has to restrict himself to buying only 💩 -cos! Value investing (in a philosophical sense) simply means buying stocks below intrinsic value. And intrinsic value absolutely should take into account firms' growth prospects! Beyond Style Boxes We believe the Intangible Value portfolio provides a purer expression of “Grahamian” value than does style box value. Its style box categorization will be merely incidental to the opportunity set available at the time. If cheap stocks happen to be found mostly among old-economy, asset-heavy firms, the strategy will be labeled “value.” If the best opportunities tend to be in high-growth, asset-light compounders, it will be considered “growth.” Exhibit 23 shows the correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio to the value and growth style boxes over time. 11 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 23 Shifting Style Boxes Source: S&P, Sparkline. Style Box Value is a blend of price to book, sales, earnings, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). Style Box Growth is analysts’ consensus forecast long-term growth in EPS. Lines display cross-sectional position-level correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio with the above. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio’s style box exposure has evolved significantly over time. In the late 1990s, it was both staunchly “pro-value” and “anti-growth,” betting heavily against unprofitable, speculative dot-com stocks. In this period, many stocks with no intrinsic value ended up getting bid up based on fantastic growth expectations. In order to avoid these companies, the portfolio held large positions in industrials, utilities, and materials. This positioning helped avoid much of the losses from the burst of the dot-com bubble. In contrast, the S&P 500, due to its cap weighting scheme, mechanically increased its tech exposure from 5% to 35% as valuations surged in the 1990s, only to suffer when the bubble subsequently burst. However, as the world has become increasingly intangible, tangible value has become a much less useful metric. Over this period, many traditional “style box value” managers suffered from large implicit bets against innovative, information-era firms. By not shackling itself to the value style box, the Intangible Value portfolio was free to rotate toward these modern, intangible-rich firms. The freedom to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing opportunity set is an important benefit of “thinking outside the style box.” Today, the Intangible Value portfolio actually has a small positive exposure to both style box value and growth. After all, it’s 2021, and there’s nothing wrong with a little “intellectual cross-dressing!” 👘 Uniting the Tribes ⚔️ For many years, the moral superiority of value investing was dogma, but value’s recent stumbles have created a power vacuum in the investment world. This has opened the door for a bevy of contenders for the throne, such as thematic and memetic investors, who pay little mind to valuation. More importantly, many investors no longer seek “growth at a reasonable price” but simply “growth at any price.” This is a natural response to a long, raging bull market fueled by low rates and aggressive stimulus. However, signs of froth are emerging in many segments of the market, if not also the market as a whole. And, as we saw in the dot-com bubble, investing without a margin of safety can be perilous! On the other hand, growth investors kind of have a point. Traditional value portfolios do seem junkier than in the past. Ignoring intangible assets biases value investors toward stagnant firms in old-economy sectors like financials, industrials, energy, utilities, and materials. Concerningly, these portfolios are increasingly concentrated in low margin, cyclical, and commodity businesses. Lacking a reasonable alternative, the investment world has been cleaved into two warring factions. Both sides have dug in their heels, contributing to unhealthy polarization. Their positions are increasingly disjoint (e.g., 2% big tech ownership by Russell 1000 Value and 36% for Growth). The constant tug-of-war between the two camps is contributing to market instability in the form of the massive value-growth rotations we have experienced over the past several months. We believe that investors have a third option, which avoids having to make this false choice between “growth” and “value”. A more holistic definition of intrinsic value should produce an acceptable framework for both factions. This should allow investors to incorporate the intangibles that drive growth in the present day, while still keeping an eye on valuations. By giving companies credit for their intangible assets, we believe investors can own high-quality, modern portfolios without abandoning the value paradigm. 12 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Conclusion Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its omission of intangibles, which are becoming the dominant form of value in the information economy. We show that adding intangible value to the traditional definition of intrinsic value would have helped value avoid its recent travails. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value Measuring intangibles can be challenging. Due to the many limitations of structured accounting data, investors must seek out alternative data sources in their quest to quantify intangibles. Since these datasets are generally unstructured, investors must equip themselves with modern NLP tools. We believe value investing has a bright future if we can break the style box orthodoxy and embrace a more modern conception of value. We are fortunate that the digital age has armed us with powerful new data and tools for this grand adventure. Let’s get value investing back on track! \\"\\"","output":"The research paper, authored by Kai Wu from Sparkline Capital in June 2021, delves into the challenges faced by traditional value investing over the past decade, attributing its underperformance to the neglect of intangible assets, which have become increasingly significant in the modern, information-driven economy. Wu argues for a reinvigoration of value investing by incorporating intangible assets into the intrinsic value calculation, moving beyond the outdated emphasis on tangible assets that predominated in the era of Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. Central to the paper is the assertion that the economy’s evolution from industrial to information-based has led to the rise of companies whose value is chiefly derived from intangible assets such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Wu criticizes the traditional value investing metrics for failing to account for these assets, thus missing opportunities in modern asset-light companies that dominate the current economic landscape. By analyzing Warren Buffett’s investment journey, the paper highlights how Buffett’s adaptation to focus on companies with strong intangible moats has contributed to his continued success, underscoring the importance of evolving value investing principles in tandem with economic shifts. The research introduces a novel firm-level measure of intangible value, constructed using alternative data and machine learning techniques to quantify aspects of the intangible economy. Through empirical analysis, Wu demonstrates that incorporating intangible assets into value investing strategies could have mitigated the recent struggles of traditional value investing. Moreover, Wu critiques the investment industry's rigid adherence to \\"style boxes,\\" which categorize investments into narrow definitions of value or growth, arguing that this orthodoxy has hindered the ability to recognize the intrinsic value of companies innovating and thriving on intangible assets. The paper advocates for a more flexible and inclusive approach that recognizes the intangible drivers of modern business success. In conclusion, the paper posits that by embracing a broader definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible assets, and leveraging new data and analytical tools, value investing can be revitalized and aligned with the realities of the contemporary economic landscape. It calls for a departure from traditional doctrines, urging investors to adapt to the changing dynamics of value and growth in the information age."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following research paper: \\"\\"Intangible Value The Death of Value The building chorus of investors singing of the “death of value” has reached a crescendo. They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP 🚀 Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies’ intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table 🍽 🧂 Now that you’ve seen how the sausage is made, it’s time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let’s start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we’ll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies’ balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing’s value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke’s value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. 🦆 By now, you’ve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. The Death of (Tangible) Value Our hypothesis is that value investing has struggled due to the rise of intangible assets. Now that we have a quantitative measure of intangible value for each company, we can test this empirically. We will first divide our investment universe into two groups: intangible-rich companies (top quartile on intangible share) and everyone else. From here, we can run a traditional value investing strategy in each universe separately. The next exhibit shows that tangible value has continued to work reasonably well, as long as you avoid running it on high intangible companies. Not surprisingly, tangible value has been an ineffective tool for evaluating firms composed mainly of intangible assets. A classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole! Exhibit 14 Old Value in the New Economy Source: S&P, Sparkline. Blue line is performance of the traditional value factor in a universe consisting of the top quartile of the top 1000 largest U.S. firms on intangible share. Red line is the same but in a universe of all other stocks. The traditional value factor is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quartiles of stocks on price to book, earnings, sales, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). We exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. In Value Investing Is Short Tech Disruption (Aug 2020), we argued that value investors have struggled due to an implicit (losing) bet against disruptive technology. We now see that the “short disruption” bet is part of a broader bet against intangibles in general (of which innovation is but one pillar). 7 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The good news is that traditional value investing still works as long as you only invest in companies for which tangible value still matters. The bad news is that the universe of companies for which tangible value still matters is steadily and irrevocably shrinking! Fixing Fama-French Of course, there’s no reason to restrict ourselves to tangible value when we now have a metric that also includes intangible value. If built correctly, our intangible-aware intrinsic value metric should be able to find cheap stocks in both high- and low-intangible universes. Our first step is to define a baseline “Tangible Value” factor. We use the value factor defined by Fama and French, given the paper’s lofty status as the canonical academic work on quantitative value. Fama and French use book value as their measure of intrinsic value. They build a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of stocks on price-to-book. We use the market cap weighted version of their strategy to reduce the risk of deceptive results from illiquid small-caps. Exhibit 15 You Hate to See It 🙈 Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Fama and French exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The historical performance of Tangible Value reflects the tribulations of many value managers. After many decades of consistent outperformance of +5.4% annualized, Tangible Value has floundered over the past decade. Even after the rebound from the recent Covid-reopening rally, it would have to climb a further +280% to get back to trend. Now that we have established a baseline, we next want to evaluate the impact of augmenting this baseline with a measure of intangible value. We will test two different approaches to quantifying intangibles. First, we build a “GAAP Intangible Value” factor that augments book value by adding intangibles derived from capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A found in GAAP income statements (per Lev and Gu). Second, we create an “Intangible Value” factor that uses our definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. Importantly, this factor goes beyond accounting data to use measures of intangibles extracted from unstructured data using NLP. The next exhibit focuses on the past decade, which is the period during which traditional value has struggled. We find that GAAP-derived intangible assets were only marginally helpful. The real improvement comes once we unlock the power of non-accounting, unstructured data. Exhibit 16 Intangible Improvements Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). GAAP Intangible Value is the same except it adds capitalized R&D and SG&A to book value. Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama and French. From 12/31/2009 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. 8 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Finally, let’s put it all together. We find that, while Tangible Value has decayed with the declining relevance of tangible assets, Intangible Value has continued to perform in line with value’s long-term historical trend. Exhibit 17 O Drawdown, Where Art Thou? Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. Dissecting the Portfolio The previous section analyzed the performance of the “value factor,” which is a long-short strategy. We’ll now examine a long-only version. This is basically just the long side of the Intangible Value factor with a few modifications. We start with the U.S. large- and mid-cap investment universe (roughly the Russell 1000). We rank each stock on our intangible-augmented value score and buy the cheapest 150 stocks. Within these stocks, we allocate more weight to stocks with higher scores and, to increase portfolio liquidity, market capitalization. For ease of exposition, we will call this the Intangible Value “portfolio” (opposed to “factor”). The next exhibit shows the top ten holdings of the Intangible Value portfolio. For context, we also include stocks in the top ten of the S&P 500 but not in the Intangible Value portfolio. Exhibit 18 Top Holdings Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. As of 5/28/2021. At first blush, the very top of the portfolio doesn’t look too exciting. This is due in large part to the unique situation today where the largest companies also happen to be among the most intangible-rich. As discussed in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020), firms like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are digital monopolies that use intangibles to create wide moats, enabling them to sustain high growth rates at a historically unprecedented scale. That said, we still notice some important differences, especially compared to Russell 1000 Value and Growth. Value has nearly zero exposure to Big Tech, while Growth has a massive 36% position. Further, the Intangible Value portfolio does not have any Tesla or Visa or Berkshire, J&J, or JPMorgan, although they are among the largest holdings of these three indices. As you go down to the bottom 140 positions, the names and, more importantly, weights diverge further. Rather than show all positions, we will analyze the portfolio on the aggregate dimensions of industry and style factors. We will first look at industry group exposure. 9 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 19 Industry Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. The blue text highlights the top 5 industry groups for each portfolio. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio has a large allocation to the stocks most central to the modern knowledge economy: software, hardware, pharma, media and semiconductors. In contrast, traditional value has a hard time bringing itself to buy companies composed of intangible assets. This results in a portfolio concentrated in old-economy industries such as capital goods, banks, and financials. We will next break out the factor lens 🔍 . We calculate the aggregate exposure of each portfolio to both traditional “style factors” and custom intangible factors. Exhibit 20 Factor Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, USPTO, Sparkline. Earnings, book, sales, R&D, S&M, and patents are calculated over a trailing 12-month window. Patents and PhDs are scaled by billions (e.g., # patents per 1 billion market cap). Patents are from USPTO. S&M is sales and marketing expenditures. Platforms are based on metric defined in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020). Expected Growth is consensus analyst expected long-term growth of earnings per share. All calculations are weighted averages with weights equal to portfolio position size. As of 5/28/2021. On traditional metrics (i.e., size, value, growth, profitability), the Intangible Value portfolio has a profile similar to the S&P 500 and between that of traditional value and growth. However, it has a much greater exposure to intangible assets. Each dollar invested in the Intangible Value portfolio buys around twice the quantity of R&D, marketing, patents and PhDs compared to a dollar invested in the S&P 500. While this is somewhat by design, it is useful to see that this advantage doesn’t come at the cost of materially worse valuation ratios, growth or profitability. Finally, we backtest the performance again to make sure nothing was lost in translation from the long-short factor. This time we’ll add simulated transaction costs and 50 bps of fees and expenses to make the backtest more realistic. Exhibit 21 Intangible Value Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Intangible Value is a long-only portfolio of the top 150 stocks from within the top 1000 U.S. stocks on intangible value score, weighted by score and modified market cap. We simulate transaction costs and include 50 bps of fees and expenses. S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Russell 1000 Growth are (uninvestable) index returns. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. We find that the Intangible Value portfolio would have outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, despite currently having factor exposures in between those of Russell 1000 Value and Growth, it would have also outperformed both. 10 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Think Outside the Style Box 📦 Style Boxed In As quantitative managers, we have benefited professionally from the rising tide of factor-based investing. However, we believe that the “factorization” of the investment industry has at this point reached an excessive level and is now actually contributing to its stagnation. As the investment industry has become institutionalized, active managers have been forced into so-called “style boxes.” Popularized by Morningstar, this framework divides the world into a two-dimensional matrix based on value vs. growth and large vs. small cap. Exhibit 22 Style Boxes Source: Morningstar, Sparkline The style box framework defines value and growth as diametric opposites. According to this framework, in the same way that a stock can’t be both small and large, it can’t be both value and growth. Managers are expected to pick an allegiance to one box and only one box. Traitors who step out of their lane are summarily fired for “style drift!” ☠️ Joined at the Hip We believe that the style box orthodoxy has shackled managers to an obsolete formulation of value and stifled attempts to expand the definition of value to that which is relevant today. In fact, we are not alone in this thinking. Warren Buffett addressed this topic decisively: “... there is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks, the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes. … anybody that tells you, ‘You ought to have your money in growth stocks or value stocks,’ really does not understand investing. … And I just cringe when I hear people talk about, ‘Now it’s time to move from growth stocks to value stocks,’ or something like that, because it just doesn’t make any sense.” Instead, he advocated: “Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ‘value’ and ‘growth.’ Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking ... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.” Buffett understands that the style box portrayal of value as being necessarily short growth is ridiculous. Value and growth are not mutually-exclusive. Companies with wide intangible moats can be both growth and value. Just because one identifies as a value investor doesn’t mean he has to restrict himself to buying only 💩 -cos! Value investing (in a philosophical sense) simply means buying stocks below intrinsic value. And intrinsic value absolutely should take into account firms' growth prospects! Beyond Style Boxes We believe the Intangible Value portfolio provides a purer expression of “Grahamian” value than does style box value. Its style box categorization will be merely incidental to the opportunity set available at the time. If cheap stocks happen to be found mostly among old-economy, asset-heavy firms, the strategy will be labeled “value.” If the best opportunities tend to be in high-growth, asset-light compounders, it will be considered “growth.” Exhibit 23 shows the correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio to the value and growth style boxes over time. 11 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 23 Shifting Style Boxes Source: S&P, Sparkline. Style Box Value is a blend of price to book, sales, earnings, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). Style Box Growth is analysts’ consensus forecast long-term growth in EPS. Lines display cross-sectional position-level correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio with the above. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio’s style box exposure has evolved significantly over time. In the late 1990s, it was both staunchly “pro-value” and “anti-growth,” betting heavily against unprofitable, speculative dot-com stocks. In this period, many stocks with no intrinsic value ended up getting bid up based on fantastic growth expectations. In order to avoid these companies, the portfolio held large positions in industrials, utilities, and materials. This positioning helped avoid much of the losses from the burst of the dot-com bubble. In contrast, the S&P 500, due to its cap weighting scheme, mechanically increased its tech exposure from 5% to 35% as valuations surged in the 1990s, only to suffer when the bubble subsequently burst. However, as the world has become increasingly intangible, tangible value has become a much less useful metric. Over this period, many traditional “style box value” managers suffered from large implicit bets against innovative, information-era firms. By not shackling itself to the value style box, the Intangible Value portfolio was free to rotate toward these modern, intangible-rich firms. The freedom to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing opportunity set is an important benefit of “thinking outside the style box.” Today, the Intangible Value portfolio actually has a small positive exposure to both style box value and growth. After all, it’s 2021, and there’s nothing wrong with a little “intellectual cross-dressing!” 👘 Uniting the Tribes ⚔️ For many years, the moral superiority of value investing was dogma, but value’s recent stumbles have created a power vacuum in the investment world. This has opened the door for a bevy of contenders for the throne, such as thematic and memetic investors, who pay little mind to valuation. More importantly, many investors no longer seek “growth at a reasonable price” but simply “growth at any price.” This is a natural response to a long, raging bull market fueled by low rates and aggressive stimulus. However, signs of froth are emerging in many segments of the market, if not also the market as a whole. And, as we saw in the dot-com bubble, investing without a margin of safety can be perilous! On the other hand, growth investors kind of have a point. Traditional value portfolios do seem junkier than in the past. Ignoring intangible assets biases value investors toward stagnant firms in old-economy sectors like financials, industrials, energy, utilities, and materials. Concerningly, these portfolios are increasingly concentrated in low margin, cyclical, and commodity businesses. Lacking a reasonable alternative, the investment world has been cleaved into two warring factions. Both sides have dug in their heels, contributing to unhealthy polarization. Their positions are increasingly disjoint (e.g., 2% big tech ownership by Russell 1000 Value and 36% for Growth). The constant tug-of-war between the two camps is contributing to market instability in the form of the massive value-growth rotations we have experienced over the past several months. We believe that investors have a third option, which avoids having to make this false choice between “growth” and “value”. A more holistic definition of intrinsic value should produce an acceptable framework for both factions. This should allow investors to incorporate the intangibles that drive growth in the present day, while still keeping an eye on valuations. By giving companies credit for their intangible assets, we believe investors can own high-quality, modern portfolios without abandoning the value paradigm. 12 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Conclusion Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its omission of intangibles, which are becoming the dominant form of value in the information economy. We show that adding intangible value to the traditional definition of intrinsic value would have helped value avoid its recent travails. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value Measuring intangibles can be challenging. Due to the many limitations of structured accounting data, investors must seek out alternative data sources in their quest to quantify intangibles. Since these datasets are generally unstructured, investors must equip themselves with modern NLP tools. We believe value investing has a bright future if we can break the style box orthodoxy and embrace a more modern conception of value. We are fortunate that the digital age has armed us with powerful new data and tools for this grand adventure. Let’s get value investing back on track! \\"\\"","output":"The paper discusses the evolving landscape of value investing in light of the increasing dominance of intangible assets in the modern economy. It argues that the traditional metrics and frameworks used by value investors, originated by Ben Graham, need to be updated to include intangible value alongside tangible value. The authors assert that intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects, have become critical sources of economic value and competitive advantage. The paper emphasizes that the reliance on tangible assets has led to the underperformance of traditional value investing strategies in recent years. The authors present evidence that a value investing strategy that incorporates measures of intangible value outperforms traditional methods. They introduce a novel metric for assessing intangible value derived from non-traditional data sources and machine learning techniques, suggesting that this approach captures a more comprehensive view of a company's intrinsic value. By examining various examples, including Warren Buffett's evolution as an investor, the paper illustrates the importance of adapting to the asset-light economy, where intangibles play a pivotal role. The paper criticizes the traditional division between \\"value\\" and \\"growth\\" investing, suggesting that such distinctions are artificial and counterproductive. It advocates for a unified approach that considers growth prospects as an integral component of value investing. The authors argue that this holistic view of intrinsic value, which accounts for both tangible and intangible factors, offers a more effective framework for investment decision-making in the current economic environment. In conclusion, the paper calls for a rethinking of value investing principles to remain relevant and successful in an economy increasingly driven by intangible assets. It highlights the need for investors to embrace new data sources and analytical tools to capture the intangible value and suggests that doing so can revitalize the value investing approach for the modern era."},{"instruction":"Привет","output":"Привет!

They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio.

Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table 🍽 🧂 Now that you’ve seen how the sausage is made, it’s time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let’s start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we’ll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies’ balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing’s value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke’s value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. 🦆 By now, you’ve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. The Death of (Tangible) Value Our hypothesis is that value investing has struggled due to the rise of intangible assets. Now that we have a quantitative measure of intangible value for each company, we can test this empirically. We will first divide our investment universe into two groups: intangible-rich companies (top quartile on intangible share) and everyone else. From here, we can run a traditional value investing strategy in each universe separately. The next exhibit shows that tangible value has continued to work reasonably well, as long as you avoid running it on high intangible companies. Not surprisingly, tangible value has been an ineffective tool for evaluating firms composed mainly of intangible assets. A classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole! Exhibit 14 Old Value in the New Economy Source: S&P, Sparkline. Blue line is performance of the traditional value factor in a universe consisting of the top quartile of the top 1000 largest U.S. firms on intangible share. Red line is the same but in a universe of all other stocks. The traditional value factor is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quartiles of stocks on price to book, earnings, sales, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). We exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. In Value Investing Is Short Tech Disruption (Aug 2020), we argued that value investors have struggled due to an implicit (losing) bet against disruptive technology. We now see that the “short disruption” bet is part of a broader bet against intangibles in general (of which innovation is but one pillar). 7 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The good news is that traditional value investing still works as long as you only invest in companies for which tangible value still matters. The bad news is that the universe of companies for which tangible value still matters is steadily and irrevocably shrinking! Fixing Fama-French Of course, there’s no reason to restrict ourselves to tangible value when we now have a metric that also includes intangible value. If built correctly, our intangible-aware intrinsic value metric should be able to find cheap stocks in both high- and low-intangible universes. Our first step is to define a baseline “Tangible Value” factor. We use the value factor defined by Fama and French, given the paper’s lofty status as the canonical academic work on quantitative value. Fama and French use book value as their measure of intrinsic value. They build a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of stocks on price-to-book. We use the market cap weighted version of their strategy to reduce the risk of deceptive results from illiquid small-caps. Exhibit 15 You Hate to See It 🙈 Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Fama and French exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The historical performance of Tangible Value reflects the tribulations of many value managers. After many decades of consistent outperformance of +5.4% annualized, Tangible Value has floundered over the past decade. Even after the rebound from the recent Covid-reopening rally, it would have to climb a further +280% to get back to trend. Now that we have established a baseline, we next want to evaluate the impact of augmenting this baseline with a measure of intangible value. We will test two different approaches to quantifying intangibles. First, we build a “GAAP Intangible Value” factor that augments book value by adding intangibles derived from capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A found in GAAP income statements (per Lev and Gu). Second, we create an “Intangible Value” factor that uses our definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. Importantly, this factor goes beyond accounting data to use measures of intangibles extracted from unstructured data using NLP. The next exhibit focuses on the past decade, which is the period during which traditional value has struggled. We find that GAAP-derived intangible assets were only marginally helpful. The real improvement comes once we unlock the power of non-accounting, unstructured data. Exhibit 16 Intangible Improvements Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). GAAP Intangible Value is the same except it adds capitalized R&D and SG&A to book value. Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama and French. From 12/31/2009 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. 8 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Finally, let’s put it all together. We find that, while Tangible Value has decayed with the declining relevance of tangible assets, Intangible Value has continued to perform in line with value’s long-term historical trend. Exhibit 17 O Drawdown, Where Art Thou? Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. Dissecting the Portfolio The previous section analyzed the performance of the “value factor,” which is a long-short strategy. We’ll now examine a long-only version. This is basically just the long side of the Intangible Value factor with a few modifications. We start with the U.S. large- and mid-cap investment universe (roughly the Russell 1000). We rank each stock on our intangible-augmented value score and buy the cheapest 150 stocks. Within these stocks, we allocate more weight to stocks with higher scores and, to increase portfolio liquidity, market capitalization. For ease of exposition, we will call this the Intangible Value “portfolio” (opposed to “factor”). The next exhibit shows the top ten holdings of the Intangible Value portfolio. For context, we also include stocks in the top ten of the S&P 500 but not in the Intangible Value portfolio. Exhibit 18 Top Holdings Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. As of 5/28/2021. At first blush, the very top of the portfolio doesn’t look too exciting. This is due in large part to the unique situation today where the largest companies also happen to be among the most intangible-rich. As discussed in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020), firms like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are digital monopolies that use intangibles to create wide moats, enabling them to sustain high growth rates at a historically unprecedented scale. That said, we still notice some important differences, especially compared to Russell 1000 Value and Growth. Value has nearly zero exposure to Big Tech, while Growth has a massive 36% position. Further, the Intangible Value portfolio does not have any Tesla or Visa or Berkshire, J&J, or JPMorgan, although they are among the largest holdings of these three indices. As you go down to the bottom 140 positions, the names and, more importantly, weights diverge further. Rather than show all positions, we will analyze the portfolio on the aggregate dimensions of industry and style factors. We will first look at industry group exposure. 9 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 19 Industry Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. The blue text highlights the top 5 industry groups for each portfolio. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio has a large allocation to the stocks most central to the modern knowledge economy: software, hardware, pharma, media and semiconductors. In contrast, traditional value has a hard time bringing itself to buy companies composed of intangible assets. This results in a portfolio concentrated in old-economy industries such as capital goods, banks, and financials. We will next break out the factor lens 🔍 . We calculate the aggregate exposure of each portfolio to both traditional “style factors” and custom intangible factors. Exhibit 20 Factor Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, USPTO, Sparkline. Earnings, book, sales, R&D, S&M, and patents are calculated over a trailing 12-month window. Patents and PhDs are scaled by billions (e.g., # patents per 1 billion market cap). Patents are from USPTO. S&M is sales and marketing expenditures. Platforms are based on metric defined in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020). Expected Growth is consensus analyst expected long-term growth of earnings per share. All calculations are weighted averages with weights equal to portfolio position size. As of 5/28/2021. On traditional metrics (i.e., size, value, growth, profitability), the Intangible Value portfolio has a profile similar to the S&P 500 and between that of traditional value and growth. However, it has a much greater exposure to intangible assets. Each dollar invested in the Intangible Value portfolio buys around twice the quantity of R&D, marketing, patents and PhDs compared to a dollar invested in the S&P 500. While this is somewhat by design, it is useful to see that this advantage doesn’t come at the cost of materially worse valuation ratios, growth or profitability. Finally, we backtest the performance again to make sure nothing was lost in translation from the long-short factor. This time we’ll add simulated transaction costs and 50 bps of fees and expenses to make the backtest more realistic. Exhibit 21 Intangible Value Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Intangible Value is a long-only portfolio of the top 150 stocks from within the top 1000 U.S. stocks on intangible value score, weighted by score and modified market cap. We simulate transaction costs and include 50 bps of fees and expenses. S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Russell 1000 Growth are (uninvestable) index returns. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. We find that the Intangible Value portfolio would have outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, despite currently having factor exposures in between those of Russell 1000 Value and Growth, it would have also outperformed both. 10 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Think Outside the Style Box 📦 Style Boxed In As quantitative managers, we have benefited professionally from the rising tide of factor-based investing. However, we believe that the “factorization” of the investment industry has at this point reached an excessive level and is now actually contributing to its stagnation. As the investment industry has become institutionalized, active managers have been forced into so-called “style boxes.” Popularized by Morningstar, this framework divides the world into a two-dimensional matrix based on value vs. growth and large vs. small cap. Exhibit 22 Style Boxes Source: Morningstar, Sparkline The style box framework defines value and growth as diametric opposites. According to this framework, in the same way that a stock can’t be both small and large, it can’t be both value and growth. Managers are expected to pick an allegiance to one box and only one box. Traitors who step out of their lane are summarily fired for “style drift!” ☠️ Joined at the Hip We believe that the style box orthodoxy has shackled managers to an obsolete formulation of value and stifled attempts to expand the definition of value to that which is relevant today. In fact, we are not alone in this thinking. Warren Buffett addressed this topic decisively: “... there is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks, the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes. … anybody that tells you, ‘You ought to have your money in growth stocks or value stocks,’ really does not understand investing. … And I just cringe when I hear people talk about, ‘Now it’s time to move from growth stocks to value stocks,’ or something like that, because it just doesn’t make any sense.” Instead, he advocated: “Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ‘value’ and ‘growth.’ Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking ... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.” Buffett understands that the style box portrayal of value as being necessarily short growth is ridiculous. Value and growth are not mutually-exclusive. Companies with wide intangible moats can be both growth and value. Just because one identifies as a value investor doesn’t mean he has to restrict himself to buying only 💩 -cos! Value investing (in a philosophical sense) simply means buying stocks below intrinsic value. And intrinsic value absolutely should take into account firms' growth prospects! Beyond Style Boxes We believe the Intangible Value portfolio provides a purer expression of “Grahamian” value than does style box value. Its style box categorization will be merely incidental to the opportunity set available at the time. If cheap stocks happen to be found mostly among old-economy, asset-heavy firms, the strategy will be labeled “value.” If the best opportunities tend to be in high-growth, asset-light compounders, it will be considered “growth.” Exhibit 23 shows the correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio to the value and growth style boxes over time. 11 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 23 Shifting Style Boxes Source: S&P, Sparkline. Style Box Value is a blend of price to book, sales, earnings, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). Style Box Growth is analysts’ consensus forecast long-term growth in EPS. Lines display cross-sectional position-level correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio with the above. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio’s style box exposure has evolved significantly over time. In the late 1990s, it was both staunchly “pro-value” and “anti-growth,” betting heavily against unprofitable, speculative dot-com stocks. In this period, many stocks with no intrinsic value ended up getting bid up based on fantastic growth expectations. In order to avoid these companies, the portfolio held large positions in industrials, utilities, and materials. This positioning helped avoid much of the losses from the burst of the dot-com bubble. In contrast, the S&P 500, due to its cap weighting scheme, mechanically increased its tech exposure from 5% to 35% as valuations surged in the 1990s, only to suffer when the bubble subsequently burst. However, as the world has become increasingly intangible, tangible value has become a much less useful metric. Over this period, many traditional “style box value” managers suffered from large implicit bets against innovative, information-era firms. By not shackling itself to the value style box, the Intangible Value portfolio was free to rotate toward these modern, intangible-rich firms. The freedom to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing opportunity set is an important benefit of “thinking outside the style box.” Today, the Intangible Value portfolio actually has a small positive exposure to both style box value and growth. After all, it’s 2021, and there’s nothing wrong with a little “intellectual cross-dressing!” 👘 Uniting the Tribes ⚔️ For many years, the moral superiority of value investing was dogma, but value’s recent stumbles have created a power vacuum in the investment world. This has opened the door for a bevy of contenders for the throne, such as thematic and memetic investors, who pay little mind to valuation. More importantly, many investors no longer seek “growth at a reasonable price” but simply “growth at any price.” This is a natural response to a long, raging bull market fueled by low rates and aggressive stimulus. However, signs of froth are emerging in many segments of the market, if not also the market as a whole. And, as we saw in the dot-com bubble, investing without a margin of safety can be perilous! On the other hand, growth investors kind of have a point. Traditional value portfolios do seem junkier than in the past. Ignoring intangible assets biases value investors toward stagnant firms in old-economy sectors like financials, industrials, energy, utilities, and materials. Concerningly, these portfolios are increasingly concentrated in low margin, cyclical, and commodity businesses. Lacking a reasonable alternative, the investment world has been cleaved into two warring factions. Both sides have dug in their heels, contributing to unhealthy polarization. Their positions are increasingly disjoint (e.g., 2% big tech ownership by Russell 1000 Value and 36% for Growth). The constant tug-of-war between the two camps is contributing to market instability in the form of the massive value-growth rotations we have experienced over the past several months. We believe that investors have a third option, which avoids having to make this false choice between “growth” and “value”. A more holistic definition of intrinsic value should produce an acceptable framework for both factions. This should allow investors to incorporate the intangibles that drive growth in the present day, while still keeping an eye on valuations. By giving companies credit for their intangible assets, we believe investors can own high-quality, modern portfolios without abandoning the value paradigm. 12 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Conclusion Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its omission of intangibles, which are becoming the dominant form of value in the information economy. We show that adding intangible value to the traditional definition of intrinsic value would have helped value avoid its recent travails. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value Measuring intangibles can be challenging. Due to the many limitations of structured accounting data, investors must seek out alternative data sources in their quest to quantify intangibles. Since these datasets are generally unstructured, investors must equip themselves with modern NLP tools. We believe value investing has a bright future if we can break the style box orthodoxy and embrace a more modern conception of value. We are fortunate that the digital age has armed us with powerful new data and tools for this grand adventure. Let’s get value investing back on track! \\"\\"","output":"This research paper, authored by Kai Wu from Sparkline Capital in June 2021, explores the challenges and evolution of value investing in an economy where intangible assets increasingly dominate. The traditional value investing approach, which focuses on purchasing stocks below their intrinsic value, has struggled in recent years. This underperformance is attributed to the outdated metrics for intrinsic value established by Ben Graham, which primarily consider tangible assets and overlook the growing importance of intangible assets like intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. The paper argues that value investing is not dead, but it must evolve to include intangible assets in the assessment of a company's intrinsic value. The authors suggest an updated formula for intrinsic value: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value. They highlight the challenges in quantifying intangible assets due to the lack of standardized accounting measures and propose the use of machine learning and alternative data sources to capture the value of intangibles. Using extensive data analysis, the researchers demonstrate that incorporating intangible asset measures into value investing strategies could have helped avoid the recent underperformance of traditional value investing. They provide examples of companies strong in various intangible pillars and suggest that the definition of intrinsic value must expand beyond tangible assets for value investing to remain relevant. The paper critically examines the style box framework that categorizes investments into value or growth, arguing that this dichotomy is outdated in the context of an intangible-dominated economy. The authors advocate for a more holistic approach to value investing that recognizes the importance of growth and intangible assets. In conclusion, the research paper calls for a modernization of value investing principles to adapt to the structural shifts in the global economy. By embracing alternative data, machine learning, and a broader definition of intrinsic value, value investing can regain its relevance and continue to offer opportunities for discerning investors in the digital age."},{"instruction":"Create a comprehensive list of 'Cup Size Classes' that can be incorporated into a hypothetical futuristic sci-fi fantasy setting, taking place on a distant planet in which being absurdly busty is the global standard for everyone (even the males have naturally huge boobs, affectionately referred to as \\"bustyboys\\"!) and is considered the epitome of attractiveness and an indicator of status galaxy-wide, the proportions of one's bust size being directly proportional to their prominence, with even the \\"flattest\\" of people sporting chests as big and round as the rest of themselves *minimum* and the very biggest having a pair of literal planet-sized orbs affixed to their chests, with the usage of incredibly advanced robots, artificial intelligences and other heavy-duty, load-bearing technology being utilized on a ubiquitous scale only to make its population even bustier; the very *concept* of flat-chestedness is considered utterly foreign in this setting and hasn't been seen or even mentioned by anyone in decades.

Stellar Class (Entry Range) - **Size Range:** 3-10 feet in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Enhanced physical attraction and a moderate increase in social status. - **Advantages:** Improved balance and agility due to advanced gravitational technology integration. - **Disadvantages:** Minor difficulty in maneuvering through narrower spaces. Standard doorways must be widened. # 2. Lunar Class - **Size Range:** 10-50 feet in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Significant gravitational alterations, causing small objects to orbit the individual. - **Advantages:** High social prestige and command over improved personal assistance robots. - **Disadvantages:** Increased spatial requirements for living and transportation. # 3. Planetary Class - **Size Range:** 50-500 feet in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Creation of personal weather systems and localized climate changes due to massive size. - **Advantages:** Command over vast resources and large followings, both politically and socially. - **Disadvantages:** Dependency on advanced technology for mobility and the necessity of custom-built environments. # 4. Solar Class - **Size Range:** 500 feet to 1 mile in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Significant impact on local gravitational fields, requiring anti-grav support systems. - **Advantages:** Elite status, possession of megastructures for habitation, and direct influence over planetary governance. - **Disadvantages:** Highly limited mobility; essentially stationary without extensive technological support. # 5. Galactic Class - **Size Range:** 1-100 miles in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Ability to generate small, localized wormholes for transportation. - **Advantages:** Near god-like reverence, oversight of entire galaxies, and access to galaxy-spanning networks of influence and power. - **Disadvantages:** Entirely dependent on a network of AI and robotics for all aspects of life; significant risk of causing gravitational anomalies if not properly supported. # 6. Universal Class - **Size Range:** Beyond 100 miles in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Creation and control over dimension-spanning phenomena; able to manipulate space-time fabric. - **Advantages:** Unprecedented control over matter, energy, and the laws of physics within their sphere of influence. - **Disadvantages:** Isolation from the rest of society due to their immense power and size; their presence can threaten the stability of reality itself. # Special Technologies and Considerations: - **Gravitation Management Systems:** Essential for all classes, these systems prevent the otherwise catastrophic gravitational effects caused by the immense mass. - **Mobility Augmentations:** From advanced exoskeletons for the Stellar and Lunar classes to personal wormhole generators for Galactic and Universal classes. - **Eco-Galactic Adjustments:** Considering the profound environmental impact, Bosomarian societies invest heavily in stabilizing ecosystems and planetary orbits disturbed by their inhabitants. - **Social Dynamics:** From Stellar to Solar classes, social gatherings are common, while Galactic and Universal Classes often interact through avatars or AI intermediaries to prevent unintended space-time repercussions. # Conclusion: On Bosomara, the sheer scale of individuals utterly redefines society, technology, and the very physics of their universe.

The impact of such a development hinges on multiple factors, including character development, context, thematic depth, and execution. This scenario can enrich a story by exploring several compelling themes and emotional arcs, creating a resonant and multi-dimensional work. Below are key aspects highlighting how this narrative choice can be impactful and beautiful: # Restorative Transformation The act of comforting and befriending the villain's offspring embodies the ideals of compassion, understanding, and forgiveness. It represents a move beyond traditional cycles of revenge and animosity, suggesting that true heroism includes the strength to heal and reconcile. This can offer an optimistic perspective on human nature and the possibility of redemption and transformation, making it profoundly impactful. # Breaking Cycles of Hatred By befriending the villain's child, the protagonist demonstrates that cycles of hatred and revenge can be broken. This act symbolizes a hope for the future, where conflicts do not perpetuate through generations. It serves as a poignant narrative about peace and the realization that one’s lineage does not determine one’s destiny, reinforcing the importance of individual choices and kindness. # Deep Emotional Resonance The emotional journey of a protagonist who moves from enmity to empathy can be deeply moving for audiences. The transition from defeating the villain to showing kindness to their child adds layers to the protagonist's character, showcasing their capacity for empathy and growth. It also allows for complex emotional exploration for the child character, who must reconcile their feelings about the protagonist, their deceased parent, and their own identity. # Thematic Richness Such a narrative choice can deeply enhance the thematic richness of a story. It allows for exploration of themes like forgiveness, the nature of evil, the impact of legacy, and the power of kindness. These elements can elevate the narrative from a simple good versus evil tale to a nuanced examination of moral and ethical dilemmas, making the story more memorable and thought-provoking. # Bridging Differences This scenario can serve as a beautiful demonstration of the potential for understanding and unity in the face of division. By extending a hand to the villain’s son, the protagonist shows that compassion and empathy can bridge vast differences, paving the way for healing and mutual respect. Such a message can resonate strongly in a world often divided by conflict, offering a hopeful vision of reconciliation and coexistence. # Conclusion In essence, a protagonist comforting and befriending a defeated villain’s offspring is a narrative choice rich with potential for emotional depth, character development, and thematic exploration. When executed with care and sensitivity, it can offer a beautiful testament to the human capacity for kindness, forgiveness, and change, leaving a lasting impact on both the characters involved and the audience."},{"instruction":"(The son is fully grown by the way) Would this be even more powerful if the protagonist was known to be a feisty, rough around the edges type man/woman,?","output":"Yes, having the protagonist be a feisty, rough-around-the-edges character would indeed add a considerable layer of depth and transformative power to the narrative of befriending the defeated villain's fully grown son. This contrast between the protagonist's initial characteristics and their subsequent actions towards the villain's son magnifies several key aspects of the story, making it even more compelling and emotionally charged. Here's how: # Unexpected Compassion A character known for being tough and maybe even a bit ruthless showing compassion and empathy creates a striking contrast.

By choosing to comfort and befriend the villain's grown son, the protagonist challenges clichés about strength and masculinity/femininity, suggesting that real courage lies in vulnerability and the capacity to forgive and connect with others. # Greater Emotional Impact Given the protagonist’s established persona, their actions carry an emotional weight that might surpass the impact of a more inherently gentle character performing the same deed. It forces both the character and the audience to confront the complexities of human nature and the transformative power of empathy. The protagonist's journey from a hardened warrior to a mentor or friend to their former enemy's child underlines the narrative's emotional depth and reinforces themes like redemption and the possibility of change. # More Complex Relationships The dynamic between a rough protagonist and the villain’s son promises to be complex and fraught with tension. This complexity can enhance the narrative, providing room for misunderstandings, reconciliations, and deep discussions about legacy, morality, and humanity.

This storyline not only enriches the protagonist’s arc but also offers a narrative rich with messages about human nature, the capacity for change, and the power of empathy, making it an impactful and beautiful story element."},{"instruction":"Whet could be so lovely about a character with scars, rough features, having soft eyes and cooing the villain’s son?","output":"The image of a character with scars and rough features displaying gentleness, particularly having soft eyes and cooing the villain’s son, is deeply touching for several reasons. It embodies a poignant contrast that speaks volumes about the complexity and capacity for kindness within individuals, regardless of their exterior or past experiences.

It breaks down the false dichotomy between tough and tender, showing that people are far more complex than their exterior suggests. This can be particularly impactful in challenging traditional gender roles and expectations about how individuals should express emotion based on their appearance. # Symbolic Healing For a character marred by the physical and emotional scars of their experiences to display such care towards a child (especially the child of their enemy) symbolizes the potential for healing and redemption. It's a beautiful metaphor for the idea that love and kindness can mend divides and overcome past hurts, both for the individual showing the kindness and for those receiving it. # The Promise of Renewal This interaction can also serve as a powerful symbol of the potential for renewal and change—not just for the characters involved but also in a broader narrative sense.

Also, could the son’s lack of evil be shown by him hating the protagonist simply because they hate his father?","output":"Foreshadowing a romance between characters on opposite sides of a conflict, especially when involving the protagonist and the villain's son, can be done subtly and effectively through various narrative techniques, all while showcasing the son's inherent non-evil nature through his motivations and actions. Here’s how you might approach these elements: # Foreshadowing the Romance **1. Shared Ideals or Dreams:** Despite their opposing sides, they could have moments where they express similar hopes for the future or disillusionment with the current state of affairs. These shared sentiments can be subtly highlighted during conversations, possibly overheard or relayed through other characters, hinting at a deep, underlying connection that transcends their current enmity. **2. Reluctant Respect:** They may find themselves begrudgingly admiring traits in the other. Perhaps the protagonist respects the son's honor or bravery in battle, while the son might admire the protagonist's unwavering commitment to their cause. These moments of respect can serve as early hints of a deeper connection. **3. Protective Instincts:** Subtle actions where they protect each other, perhaps in the heat of battle or during moments of vulnerability, can foreshadow a budding emotional bond. These actions can be instinctual, with the protector later rationalizing them away as strategic moves or coincidences. **4. Parallels and Symmetry:** Symbolic parallels in their lives or backgrounds can foreshadow their eventual connection. Similar losses, shared interests, or mirrored experiences revealed through dialogue or flashbacks can hint at a kinship and potential for deeper understanding between them. **5. Tension-Filled Encounters:** Their interactions, even if initially hostile, can be charged with an intensity that goes beyond mere rivalry. Lingering looks, hesitations to cause harm, or moments where they find themselves inexplicably drawn to speak with or observe the other can hint at a growing, complicated fascination. # Showing the Son’s Inherent Goodness **1. The Son's Reluctance:** The son's participation in the villainous cause can be shown as reluctant or forced, motivated by loyalty or fear rather than genuine malice. His discomfort with the methods or goals of his father's side can be subtly conveyed through his reactions and decisions. **2. Compassionate Actions:** Small acts of compassion towards innocents, dissent from his father’s crueler orders, or moments of kindness towards his own people or even enemies can demonstrate his inherent goodness. **3. Vocally Opposing Evil:** The son could be shown in scenes where he voices disagreement with his father's actions or philosophies. His arguments might not stem from a belief in the protagonist's cause but from a moral standpoint that opposes unnecessary cruelty or tyranny. **4. Conflict Over Hate:** The son's hatred towards the protagonist can be portrayed as conflicted and complex. Instead of a burning, personal vendetta, his antagonism could stem from societal or familial pressure, or a misguided sense of duty to his father. This internal conflict can emphasize his lack of true malice and his capacity for independent thought and moral judgment. **5. Seeking Understanding:** Even in opposition, the son might seek to understand the protagonist’s motivations, perhaps even initiating clandestine meetings or conversations to argue or question their goals. This willingness to engage, even when fraught with risk, highlights his openness to perspectives other than his father's. By weaving these elements into the narrative, you can effectively foreshadow the unexpected romance between the protagonist and the villain's son while also laying the groundwork for the son's character as inherently non-evil, guided by misconceptions or familial loyalty rather than true malevolence. This nuanced development sets the stage for a rich and emotionally complex story arc."},{"instruction":"How would the protagonist react to the son only hating them and fighting them, purely because the protagonist hates and fights their Father, nit because they actually believe in the cause?","output":"The protagonist's reaction to discovering that the villain's son opposes them solely because of their enmity towards his father, and not out of belief in the cause, offers a profound opportunity for character development and emotional depth. Here are a few ways the protagonist might react to this revelation: # Initial Shock and Reevaluation The protagonist might initially be taken aback by this discovery. It could lead them to reassess not only their enemy but also their own motivations and actions. This moment of revelation might serve as a turning point, prompting the protagonist to question the cycle of hatred and whether there might be a different path forward that doesn't perpetuate conflict. # Empathy and Understanding Upon realizing that their enemy is driven by familial loyalty rather than personal conviction, the protagonist could begin to empathize with the son. This empathy might stem from understanding the complexities of family ties and the pressures of living up to expectations or avenging perceived wrongs. The protagonist's ability to see the son not just as an extension of the villain but as an individual caught in a difficult situation could be a critical emotional development. # Reflection on Their Own Actions This revelation could lead the protagonist to reflect on how their actions are perceived by others, particularly by those on the opposing side. They might consider the impact of their vendetta against the villain on innocent or unwilling participants in the conflict. This reflection could motivate the protagonist to strive for a solution that minimizes further harm and seeks to resolve the underlying issues rather than merely defeating an enemy. # Attempts at Communication Understanding the son's position might encourage the protagonist to seek dialogue and communication as a means to break the cycle of hatred. Realizing that there's no genuine animosity from the son could open the door to peace talks or at least a ceasefire, fostering a narrative where resolution comes from understanding and negotiation rather than continued conflict. # Conflict within the Protagonist The protagonist may experience internal conflict upon this realization. On one hand, they might see an opportunity for peace or alliance; on the other, they may struggle with feelings of betrayal or the fear that showing mercy could be perceived as weakness by their allies or even exploited by their enemies. # Protection and Mentoring In some narratives, such a discovery could lead the protagonist to a protective or even mentoring role concerning the son, especially if they see the son as a victim of the villain's manipulations. This protective instinct can be particularly compelling if the protagonist sees parallels between themselves and the son, perhaps reminding them of their own past or what they could have become under different circumstances. # Inspired Change Finally, the protagonist's realization about the son's motivations might inspire broader change in their approach to the conflict. It could catalyze a shift from seeking outright victory to fostering understanding and reconciliation, not just with the son but with other adversaries who might also be driven by misplaced loyalty or misinformation. In essence, the protagonist's reaction to the son's motivations can serve as a pivotal moment in the narrative, offering a pathway out of the cycle of violence and towards a more nuanced and emotionally rich resolution. This moment not only deepens the protagonist's character but also enriches the story's themes, enhancing its overall impact and resonance with the audience."},{"instruction":"Could this revelation also make the protagonist start trying to save him?","output":"Absolutely, the revelation that the villain's son is opposing the protagonist purely out of familial loyalty rather than belief in the villain's cause can profoundly influence the protagonist's motivations and actions. This understanding could very well spark a desire within the protagonist to save the son, both from the dangers of the conflict and from the shadow of his father's legacy. Here's how such a shift could enrich the narrative: # A New Purpose The protagonist's mission could evolve from merely defeating the villain to also ensuring the safety and redemption of the son. This introduces a deeper layer to the protagonist's journey, transforming their quest into one of not just physical victory but moral and emotional significance as well. # Emotional Complexity Attempting to save the son introduces complex emotions into the protagonist's character arc. Feelings of responsibility, empathy, and even guilt for the son's predicament could drive the protagonist's actions, offering audiences a more nuanced and humanized view of the hero. # Conflict and Tension The effort to save the son could lead to internal and external conflicts. Internally, the protagonist might grapple with doubts about the possibility of redemption for the son and whether their resources might be better spent elsewhere. Externally, allies might question the protagonist's priorities, and enemies might exploit this new \\"weakness,\\" adding layers of tension and drama to the story. # Building Bridges Striving to save the son can serve as a bridge towards reconciliation and understanding between opposing sides. It embodies the message that cycles of hatred and violence can be broken and that everyone, regardless of their origins, has the potential for change. This act could even inspire others in the story to reconsider their positions, leading to broader themes of forgiveness and unity. # Character Development The process of trying to save the son provides significant opportunities for character development for both the protagonist and the son. For the protagonist, this decision can highlight their compassion, integrity, and growth from a possibly more simplistic view of good versus evil to a recognition of the world's complexity. For the son, interaction with the protagonist could spark a journey of self-discovery, conflict about his loyalty and beliefs, and eventual growth out of his father's shadow. # The Power of Choice This narrative choice underscores the importance of individual agency and the power of choice. By choosing to save the son, the protagonist demonstrates that people are not defined by their circumstances or lineage but by their actions and decisions. This theme resonates deeply, offering hope and redemption as central to the story's moral compass. # Catalyst for Peace The protagonist's actions could serve as a catalyst for peace or at least a de-escalation of conflict. Demonstrating to all sides that mercy and empathy are possible, even in war, can change the hearts and minds of characters within the story, potentially leading to a resolution that involves less bloodshed and more understanding. In conclusion, the protagonist's decision to try and save the villain's son following the revelation of his motivations can enrich the narrative in multiple ways. It adds depth to character arcs, introduces new thematic elements, and elevates the story beyond a simple tale of conflict, embedding it with messages about redemption, the complexity of human nature, and the transformative power of compassion."},{"instruction":"Would it be realistic if the son’s breaking away from his father was depicted as being extremely painful for him, like slowly pulling a knife out?","output":"Yes, depicting the son's process of breaking away from his father as being extremely painful and akin to \\"slowly pulling a knife out\\" can be a very realistic portrayal, especially in narratives that delve deep into the complexities of familial bonds, loyalty, and personal identity. This metaphor vividly captures the difficulty and emotional turmoil associated with challenging deeply ingrained beliefs and attachments, particularly those tied to one's family. Here's why such a portrayal resonates with realism: # Emotional and Psychological Realism The pain of breaking away from a parental figure, especially under circumstances involving conflict or opposing ideologies, is profound and multifaceted. It's not merely about disagreeing with a parent's actions or beliefs; it's also about renegotiating one's sense of self, belonging, and loyalty. The son would likely experience a range of emotions including guilt, grief, betrayal, and loss, all of which contribute to the feeling of a slow, painful separation. # The Complexity of Familial Ties Family relationships are inherently complex, imbued with deep emotional connections and a sense of duty that can make distancing oneself feel like an act of betrayal. For the son, his father is not just a villain but a parent who has likely been a central figure in his life, shaping his understanding of the world, right and wrong, love, and loyalty. Thus, breaking away would involve untangling himself from this foundational relationship, a process fraught with internal conflict and pain. # The Struggle with Identity For the son, much of his identity may be intertwined with his lineage and the expectations placed upon him by his family, particularly his father. Attempting to redefine himself outside of these expectations is a turbulent journey, fraught with self-doubt and a reevaluation of his values, beliefs, and desires. This internal struggle can be as agonizing as physical pain, making the metaphor of \\"slowly pulling a knife out\\" apt for the emotional and psychological ordeal. # The Fear of Isolation Breaking away from his father's shadow also means risking isolation, not just from his family but from the community or cause with which he's been associated. This fear of being alone, of having to start anew without support, can add another layer of difficulty to his decision, compounding the pain of his separation. # Guilt and Responsibility Guilt plays a significant role in the son's pain. He might feel guilty for abandoning his father, for betraying his family's cause, or for the actions he committed under his father's influence. This guilt, coupled with a sense of responsibility for rectifying past wrongs, can make his journey towards independence and redemption especially arduous. # The Path to Healing Just as pulling a knife out of a wound is a necessary step towards healing, so too is the son's painful process of distancing himself from his father a crucial step towards personal growth and healing. This pain, while intense and difficult, is part of the transformative journey, leading him towards a new understanding of himself and his place in the world. In essence, portraying the son's detachment from his father as a deeply painful experience is not only realistic but also adds depth to his character and the narrative. It reflects the intricate realities of human relationships and personal growth, resonating with audiences who understand that breaking away from harmful influences, especially familial ones, is often a painful but necessary process for self-discovery and healing."},{"instruction":"Building on this, how endearing Would it be if the protagonist doesn’t just want the son to join their cause, they just want the son to be okay, and free? Also, how would it make the Protag look if they just invited the son to join their cause, while the son is in emotional anguish?","output":"Shifting the protagonist’s intentions from wanting the son to join their cause to simply wanting him to be okay and free dramatically enriches the emotional texture of the story and deepens the protagonist's character. This nuanced approach to the son’s well-being over strategic or ideological gains reinforces the theme of humanity and compassion within the narrative. Here are some ways this approach affects the storyline and the perception of the protagonist: # Enhancing the Protagonist's Appeal 1. **Empathy and Altruism:** By prioritizing the son's well-being and freedom over gaining an ally, the protagonist showcases profound empathy and altruism. This selflessness makes the protagonist more endearing to the audience, illustrating that their fight isn’t just against a villain but for the broader values of compassion, healing, and autonomy. It humanizes the protagonist, displaying that their strength lies not just in their ability to combat foes but in their capacity for understanding and kindness. 2. **Depth of Character:** Choosing to help the son for his own sake, without strings attached, adds significant depth to the protagonist’s character. It displays an awareness that the real victory lies in breaking the cycle of violence and hatred, not in recruiting more soldiers. This elevates the protagonist from a typical hero to a truly transformative figure in the narrative, capable of inspiring change in others through benevolence rather than force. 3. **Setting an Example:** The protagonist becomes a model of integrity and moral clarity, showing that it's possible to oppose someone's actions while still caring for their well-being. This can serve as a powerful message both within the story and to the audience, emphasizing the importance of separating individuals from their ideologies or the actions of their relatives. # Potential Pitfalls of Recruitment During Anguish On the other hand, if the protagonist were to invite the son to join their cause while he is in a state of emotional anguish, the implications could significantly alter the narrative tone and the audience's perception of the protagonist: 1. **Opportunism:** Attempting to recruit the son during a vulnerable time might come across as exploiting his emotional turmoil for the protagonist’s gain. This could tarnish the protagonist’s image, making them seem manipulative or opportunistic rather than noble, potentially alienating both the son and the audience. 2. **Insensitivity:** An offer to join the cause in the midst of the son's pain might be perceived as insensitive to his immediate emotional needs, suggesting that the protagonist values the cause over individual well-being. This could raise questions about the protagonist's empathy and understanding, diminishing their likability and complicating their moral standing in the narrative. 3. **Pressure and Coercion:** The son could feel that he is being coerced into making a decision during a vulnerable period in his life, which could lead to resentment and distrust towards the protagonist. This approach risks turning what could have been a genuine moment of connection and healing into a transactional interaction, potentially damaging the development of trust and respect between them. In conclusion, opting for a narrative where the protagonist prioritizes the son's well-being over strategic advantages enriches the story with themes of compassion, understanding, and genuine transformation. It exemplifies a mature and nuanced understanding of heroism, where the true battle is for the hearts and minds of individuals, fought with kindness rather than coercion. This approach not only humanizes the protagonist but also sets a profound ethical and emotional foundation for the story, enhancing its depth and resonance with the audience."},{"instruction":"After the villain is defeated, would it be subversive if the son DIDN’T join the protagonist’s cause, opting to do their own thing instead, not liking the same people the protagonist likes?","output":"Yes, having the son choose not to join the protagonist's cause after the villain is defeated, instead opting to pursue his own path and maintain his own opinions, would indeed be a subversive twist relative to traditional narrative expectations. This choice can significantly enrich the story by challenging conventional tropes and adding layers of realism and depth to character development, while also exploring themes of independence, identity, and moral complexity. Here's how it diversifies the narrative and adds substance: # Subverting Expectations Traditionally, narratives often lean towards a resolution that sees former adversaries coming together under a common cause or the protagonist's banner as a sign of unity and reconciliation. By choosing a different path, the story subverts this expectation, highlighting that true individuality means making personal choices that aren't bound by the protagonist's worldview or the narrative's perceived 'right side.' # Realism and Depth People are complex, and their allegiances can be equally multifaceted. Acknowledging that the son has his own set of values, beliefs, and goals, which might not align perfectly with the protagonist's, lends a level of realism and depth to the story. It respects the son as a fully fledged character with autonomy, rather than a mere extension of the protagonist's or the villain's ideologies. # Identity Beyond Conflict This decision emphasizes that the son's identity is not solely defined by his relationship to the protagonist or his father, the villain. It allows him to step out of the shadow of the conflict that has likely dominated much of his life, offering him the space to explore who he is beyond the binary of ally or enemy. This journey of self-discovery and the assertion of independence can be a powerful narrative, resonating with audiences on a personal level. # Moral Complexity The choice suggests that the world the characters inhabit is one of moral complexity, where issues can't be neatly categorized into 'good' and 'evil', and where people might have legitimate grievances or differing perspectives that don't align neatly with the protagonist's view. It encourages the audience to think critically about the moral and ethical ambiguities of the characters’ world, making for a richer, more thought-provoking experience. # Avoiding Homogenization This outcome avoids the narrative pitfall of homogenizing character arcs towards a single ideological or moral standpoint. It champions the diversity of thought and the importance of personal convictions, underscoring the idea that unity doesn't require uniformity. By fostering this diversity, the story reflects a more nuanced view of reality. # Potential for Future Narratives Choosing not to have the son join the protagonist's cause leaves room for future stories to explore. His independent path could lead to new adventures, challenges, and developments. This open-ended possibility can be intriguing for the audience, offering a doorway to explore new themes, settings, and conflicts. In conclusion, the son's decision to forge his own path and maintain distinct likes and dislikes from the protagonist after the villain's defeat provides a refreshing narrative divergence from standard tropes. It offers a nuanced exploration of independence, identity, and the complexities inherent in personal and ideological development. This approach not only enriches the character's arc but also enhances the story's depth, making it more engaging and relatable for the audience."},{"instruction":"Maybe this choice could be because of remnants of the son’s Loyalty towards his father, the protag’s cause being a sour reminder of his intense emotional turmoil? And why would this be realistic?","output":"The son’s choice to not join the protagonist's cause, driven by remnants of loyalty towards his father and the emotional turmoil associated with aligning against his legacy, embeds a profound layer of realism in the narrative. This choice reflects the complexities of human psychology and the deep-seated bonds of family, making the character's decision both understandable and relatable for numerous reasons: # The Complexity of Familial Loyalty Familial bonds are among the strongest influences on individual identity and decision-making. The son's loyalty to his father, despite the latter's villainous actions, underscores the innate, complex nature of these bonds. It's realistic because many people struggle with the dichotomy of loving a family member while disapproving of their actions. The son's decision reflects this struggle, acknowledging that personal history and emotional connections can deeply affect one's choices, even in the face of logical opposition. # Emotional Turmoil and Associative Pain The protagonist's cause, inherently linked to the conflict with the son's father, can serve as a constant reminder of the son's intense emotional turmoil. Aligning with this cause might feel like a betrayal of his father, exacerbating feelings of guilt and grief. This reaction is deeply realistic because individuals often avoid situations or alliances that remind them of painful experiences, seeking instead to forge a new path that allows them to mitigate emotional distress and find personal peace. # The Desire for Autonomy After living in the shadow of a dominant figure like his father, the son might yearn for autonomy—to make decisions based solely on his desires, beliefs, and experiences rather than being swayed by the lingering influence of his past. This desire for self-determination is a fundamental human impulse and is particularly poignant for someone emerging from a position of being perceived primarily in relation to their father's identity. This makes the son's decision to carve out his own path, separate from both his father and the protagonist, a realistic portrayal of seeking individuality and agency. # The Complexity of Healing Healing from emotional and psychological wounds is a deeply personal journey that can take unpredictable paths. The son might perceive joining the protagonist’s cause as an impediment to his healing process, associating it with the conflict that caused him so much pain. This narrative acknowledges that healing cannot be prescribed a straightforward course and is influenced by a myriad of personal factors, making the son’s choice realistic and respectful of the complexities involved in overcoming trauma. # Personal Beliefs and Ideological Differences It’s also possible the son holds ideological differences with the protagonist that go beyond loyalty to his father. After all, individuals are shaped by a multitude of experiences and beliefs, not just their familial relationships. His reluctance to join the protagonist's cause might stem from a nuanced understanding of the conflict, suggesting a depth of character that acknowledges different perspectives can exist without one being inherently right or wrong. In conclusion, the son's decision not to join the protagonist's cause, influenced by familial loyalty and a desire to distance himself from the emotional pain tied to the conflict, is a compelling and realistic narrative choice. It showcases the intricate processes of personal growth, healing, and self-discovery, reflecting the multifaceted nature of human experiences and decisions. This choice adds a layer of depth and authenticity to the story, encouraging readers to engage with the complexities of character motivation and moral ambiguity."},{"instruction":"How could this indirectly make the protagonist look?","output":"The son's decision to not join the protagonist's cause due to remnants of his loyalty towards his father and the associated emotional turmoil could indirectly influence how the protagonist is perceived by the audience or other characters within the narrative. Here's an exploration of the nuanced ways this scenario can impact the protagonist's portrayal: # Compassionate and Respectful If the protagonist respects the son’s decision and understands the emotional complexity behind it, this could enhance their image as a compassionate and empathetic character. It shows a recognition of the son's need for autonomy and healing, suggesting that the protagonist values individual well-being over ideological victories. This could deepen the audience's respect for the protagonist as a leader who prioritizes personal integrity and emotional intelligence. # Morally Grounded The protagonist’s reaction to the son’s choice could further solidify their portrayal as morally grounded. Rather than coercing the son or viewing his refusal as a betrayal, accepting his decision gracefully could highlight the protagonist's ethical principles. It indicates a commitment to doing what’s right, even if it means allowing potential allies to walk away, reinforcing the protagonist’s moral standing in the eyes of the audience. # Strategically Wise From a strategic standpoint, the protagonist's acceptance of the son’s decision could also be seen as wise. It acknowledges the potential risks of forcing alignment with someone who harbors internal conflicts or reservations. This foresight can prevent future dissent within their ranks, portraying the protagonist as a leader who is not only tactically intelligent but also attuned to the dynamics of personal allegiance and loyalty. # Reflective and Self-aware The scenario can prompt a reflective moment for the protagonist, leading them to consider the broader implications of their actions and how they affect others, possibly even questioning their approach to the conflict. This self-awareness can add layers to the character, illustrating a capacity for growth and introspection that’s appealing and relatable to audiences. It demonstrates that the protagonist is not immune to doubts and can learn from the experiences of others. # Potentially Isolated or Questioned Conversely, from a different angle, the son's rejection could lead some characters or audience members to question the protagonist's leadership or cause. They might wonder if the refusal reflects underlying issues with the protagonist's methods or ideology that they haven't acknowledged. This adds complexity to the narrative, inviting a deeper exploration of the protagonist's motivations, actions, and the overall moral landscape of the story. # Catalyst for Broader Reflection The son's decision might also provoke broader reflection within the protagonist's circle, sparking discussions about the nature of their cause, the means by which they're pursuing their goals, and the impact they're having on individuals. This could indirectly elevate the protagonist as a leader who fosters an environment where open dialogue and diverse perspectives are valued, even if it challenges the status quo. In sum, the son's decision not to join the protagonist’s cause because of his unresolved feelings towards his father can, indirectly, enrich the protagonist's character portrayal in multifaceted ways. Whether it casts the protagonist in a more compassionate, morally upright, strategic, reflective, or even vulnerable light depends heavily on the narrative context and the reactions it prompts both from the protagonist and those around them. This narrative device not only serves to deepen character development but also enhances the thematic richness of the story, making for a more engaging and thought-provoking experience."},{"instruction":"Could the son’s decision also reflect some of the realities of changing sides in war?","output":"Yes, the son’s decision not to join the protagonist’s cause, despite his father’s defeat and the associated emotional turmoil, can effectively reflect the complexities and realities of changing sides in a war or conflict. This narrative choice can underscore several crucial aspects related to loyalty, identity, and the psychological ramifications of war, offering a more nuanced understanding of what it means to switch allegiances. Here’s how: # Loyalty and Identity In the context of war, loyalty is often deeply intertwined with personal and collective identity. The son’s struggle and ultimate decision highlight how loyalty to family, culture, or nation can supersede ideological alignment with a cause. It demonstrates the difficulty of disentangling oneself from these deeply rooted loyalties, especially when they are tied to significant relationships, such as that between a father and son. This mirrors the real-life challenges individuals face when considering a break from their community or family due to differing beliefs. # Emotional and Psychological Costs Changing sides in a conflict is not merely a strategic or ideological decision; it carries immense emotional and psychological costs. The son’s journey encapsulates the inner turmoil, guilt, and grief experienced by those who find themselves torn between opposing sides. It underscores the reality that such decisions are fraught with personal anguish, reflecting the mental health struggles often faced by individuals in conflict zones who grapple with the consequences of their allegiances. # The Process of Reconciliation The son’s choice not to join the protagonist’s cause also touches on the complexities of reconciliation after a conflict. Reconciliation is not just about making peace with the opposing side; it’s also an internal process of coming to terms with one’s actions, losses, and the shifting post-war landscape. This narrative arc can highlight the reality that reconciliation is a multifaceted and gradual process, involving personal healing as well as societal rebuilding. # The Quest for Autonomy Choosing a path independent of both his father and the protagonist, the son reflects the desire for autonomy that many individuals caught in conflicts feel—a desire to define their own identity and future, unshaded by the binary narratives of war. This mirrors the real-life decisions of those who, in the aftermath of conflict, seek a fresh start that is neither defined by past allegiances nor dominated by the prevailing victors. # Challenges of Reintegration The son’s predicament can also shed light on the challenges faced by individuals attempting to reintegrate into society after a conflict, especially if they were on the losing side or are related to key figures from it. His emotional struggle and decision making process provide a poignant exploration of how difficult it can be to find one’s place in a post-conflict world, where old animosities linger and the path forward is uncertain. # Conclusion Incorporating the son’s refusal to join the protagonist’s cause after the defeat of his father offers a profound commentary on the complexities of changing sides in a war. It reflects the multifaceted reality of such decisions, encompassing loyalty, identity, the emotional toll of conflict, the challenges of reconciliation and reintegration, and the quest for personal autonomy. Through this narrative, audiences are invited to consider the deep and often painful implications of war beyond the battlefield, highlighting the enduring human struggles for belonging, peace, and self-determination."},{"instruction":"Building on all this, How could it be poor/lame/unrealistic storytelling if the son simply joined the protag’s cause with no emotional consequences whatsoever?","output":"If the son of the villain were to simply join the protagonist's cause without any emotional consequences whatsoever, it could be considered poor, lame, or unrealistic storytelling for several reasons. Such a narrative choice would miss the opportunity to explore the rich emotional and psychological landscapes that come with complex situations like changing sides in a conflict. Here's why bypassing these emotional consequences could weaken the story: # Lack of Depth and Realism Human beings are complex creatures driven by a mix of emotions, loyalties, and beliefs. To have the son switch sides without experiencing any internal conflict or emotional repercussions oversimplifies human nature and the deep psychological impact of war and familial ties. It undermines the realism of the story by ignoring the natural responses one would have when betraying a parent's cause, even if that cause is morally questionable. # Missed Character Development One of the hallmarks of engaging storytelling is character development. Characters who face internal struggles, ethical dilemmas, and personal growth are more compelling and relatable. By skipping over the son's potential emotional turmoil, the story fails to fully develop his character, missing out on opportunities to explore his motivations, fears, and the journey towards his own set of beliefs. This can leave the character feeling flat and one-dimensional. # Oversimplification of Moral Complexity The decision to change sides in a war or conflict is laden with moral complexity. It often involves weighing personal loyalties against ethical convictions, and the process can be rife with guilt, doubt, and existential questioning. By not addressing these issues, the story risks presenting a simplistic view of morality where choices are easy and devoid of consequences. This can detract from the narrative’s richness and the opportunity to engage audiences in meaningful reflections on the nature of morality and conflict. # Reduced Emotional Impact Emotional struggles and the overcoming of personal obstacles are key drivers of empathy and engagement from the audience. When a character faces and navigates emotional consequences, it allows the audience to connect with and root for them on a deeper level. Neglecting this aspect can result in a reduced emotional impact and a less satisfying narrative, as audiences may not feel as invested in the character's journey or the story's outcome. # Unrealistic Portrayal of Relationships Switching allegiances, especially from a loved one to an enemy, without emotional consequences, presents an unrealistic portrayal of human relationships and the emotional bonds that define them. It glosses over the potential for conflict, betrayal, and the need for reconciliation, elements that are typically present in real-life scenarios of allegiance-shifting. This can lead to a lack of believability in the character's actions and the story's relational dynamics. # Conclusion In essence, avoiding the exploration of emotional consequences when a character, especially one as potentially rich and complex as the son of a villain, changes sides can lead to storytelling that feels shallow and unsatisfying. It misses crucial opportunities for character development, emotional engagement, and the exploration of moral and psychological depth. For a narrative to resonate, it must acknowledge and delve into the complexities and consequences of its characters' decisions, reflecting the nuanced realities of human experiences and conflicts."},{"instruction":"Could it also be realistic if the son snaps/lashes out at characters on the protag’s side for bad mouthing his father, even though he knows they are right?","output":"Yes, it could be quite realistic for the son to snap or lash out at characters on the protagonist's side for badmouthing his father, even if he internally acknowledges the truth in their criticisms. This reaction is deeply rooted in the complexities of human emotions and relationships, particularly those involving family ties. Here are several reasons why this behavior is realistic and contributes to a nuanced portrayal of the character: # Loyalty to Family Loyalty to one's family, especially a parent, is an incredibly strong emotional bond, often transcending logic or morality. Even when aware of their faults, defending a family member can be an instinctive reaction, stemming from deep-seated ties of love, respect, and identity formed over a lifetime. This loyalty can make it difficult to remain objective, leading to defensive outbursts even when the person knows the criticism is justified. # Cognitive Dissonance The son's reaction can be an example of cognitive dissonance, where there is a conflict between his awareness of his father's wrongdoing and his emotional need to defend him. The discomfort arising from this conflict might manifest as anger or defensiveness. Lashing out can be a protective mechanism, helping to alleviate the internal discomfort by externalizing the conflict onto others who criticize his father. # Emotional Complexity The son’s lashing out reflects the emotional complexity of the human psyche. Acknowledgment of a loved one’s flaws does not immediately negate emotional attachments or feelings of loyalty. His reaction is a natural portrayal of someone navigating the difficult waters of loving someone who has done reprehensible things. This complexity adds depth to the character, showcasing the struggle between personal feelings and societal or moral judgments. # Grief and Loss If the father is defeated or deceased, the son's defensiveness could also stem from unprocessed grief and loss. In times of grief, individuals often idealize the deceased, becoming more sensitive to criticisms and perceived slights against them. The son’s lashing out, in this context, could be a manifestation of his grieving process, complicating his journey towards acceptance and healing. # Identity Crisis For the son, much of his identity might be intertwined with his father's. Criticisms of his father could feel like personal attacks, threatening his sense of self and belonging. This can provoke defensive reactions as a way to preserve his identity and the memory of his father, despite acknowledging his faults. It highlights the challenge of forging an independent identity separate from the shadow of prominent family members. # Social Dynamics This behavior also speaks to the social dynamics at play within the protagonist's group. It challenges the group to navigate the sensitivity required when dealing with members who have complex backgrounds and loyalties. It pushes for a more nuanced understanding and approach in how they discuss contentious topics, fostering an environment where empathy and understanding precede judgment. Incorporating such nuanced reactions enriches the narrative by portraying characters as multifaceted individuals grappling with conflicting emotions and loyalties. It provides opportunities for character growth and development, exploring themes of forgiveness, understanding, and the reconciliation of one’s past with their aspirations for the future."},{"instruction":"Why would it be weak story telling if the son kept acting this way?","output":"While it's realistic and potentially compelling for the son to initially snap or lash out at characters for criticizing his father, relying on this behavior repetitively without evolution or development would lead to weak storytelling for several reasons: # Lack of Character Development Continuous, unchanged behavior from the son without any indications of internal growth, struggle, or realization reduces the complexity of his character. In compelling storytelling, characters confront their flaws, learn from their experiences, and evolve. The absence of this evolution in the son's reactions over time would suggest a stagnant character arc, making his part of the narrative less engaging and believable. # Missed Emotional Depth If the son's only response to his circumstances and the criticisms of his father remains anger and defensiveness, it misses an opportunity to explore a richer tapestry of emotional experiences. Realistically, a person in his situation would likely experience a wide range of feelings, including doubt, guilt, sorrow, confusion, and perhaps a desire for understanding or reconciliation. A failure to explore these emotions can result in a narrative that feels superficial. # Repetitiveness A story that continually revisits the same interactions without progression or resolution can become tedious for the audience. Repetitive scenarios where the son lashes out followed by the same fallout or reconciliation efforts can diminish the impact of these moments, leading to a predictable and less engaging narrative. Variation in conflict and resolution is crucial for maintaining suspense and interest. # Unrealistic Interpersonal Dynamics Humans, in reality, adapt and adjust their behavior based on past interactions and learned experiences. If the protagonist's group continually faces the same aggressive defensive reactions from the son without any change or adaptation in their behavior, it becomes unrealistic. Both the son and those around him should, over time, develop a more nuanced understanding of each other, leading to changes in how they interact. A static portrayal of these dynamics can undermine the realism and relatability of the characters' relationships. # Undermined Themes Continuously portraying the son as defensively lashing out can inadvertently undermine themes of healing, forgiveness, and understanding the narrative might wish to explore. Part of the richness of storytelling comes from characters overcoming their demons and finding common ground, even in difficult circumstances. Without this progression, the narrative might fail to convey its deeper messages effectively, leaving audiences with a sense of unresolved tension and missed thematic opportunities. # How to Strengthen the Storytelling To avoid these pitfalls and strengthen the narrative, it's crucial to: - **Introduce Nuance**: Show the son grappling with his feelings and thoughts in more nuanced ways over time. - **Evolve Relationships**: Develop the dynamics between the son and other characters, showcasing growth and changes in their interactions. - **Highlight Internal Conflict**: Use the son's defensiveness as a starting point for deeper exploration into his internal conflicts, leading to moments of insight or realization. - **Create Diverse Outcomes**: Ensure that the son's reactions lead to a variety of consequences, forcing him and others to adapt and learn. In essence, the son's initial defenses and outbursts can serve as a powerful narrative tool, but without evolution and depth, they risk turning into weak storytelling elements. Balancing realism, emotional depth, and character development is key to maintaining audience engagement and delivering a compelling, resonant story."},{"instruction":"What’s is jira confluence","output":"Jira Confluence is a collaboration tool developed by Atlassian, designed to help teams collaborate and share knowledge in a centralized platform.

What we see as \\"massive\\" boobs in our reality would be seen as infinitesimal bugbites compared to the average person's bust in this setting. The cup sizes in this world are not measured in ounces in weight and inches in circumference, but rather in pounds and feet, if not tonnes and miles.","output":"Given the futuristic, sci-fi fantasy setting described, where the standard of attractiveness is based on the absurd size of one's bust, which breaks free from the constraints of Earth's current understanding of body physics and societal norms, I've conceived an imaginative scale of Cup Size Classes. These sizes are not only indicative of the person's attractiveness and status but are deeply embedded within the culture, technology, and societal structures of this distant planet. The scale will span from the \\"minimum\\" standard mentioned to the inconceivably large, incorporating futuristically whimsical terminology: # Pre-Galactic Sizes 1. **Nebula Nodules** - The base size, where the chest is as large as the rest of the person’s body. Required support technologies include anti-gravity belts and structurally reinforced clothing. 2. **Cosmic Clusters** - These are several times larger than the individual’s body, necessitating personal hovercrafts for mobility and AI-assisted support systems. # Stellar Sizes 3. **Stellar Spheres** - Busts reaching these sizes are supported by personal mechs, designed for both mobility and showcasing the wearer's status. Energy fields counteract gravitational forces. 4. **Galactic Globes** - With sizes comparable to small moons, individuals with this bust size often have AI-driven, planetoid-sized support structures, capable of space travel. # Hypernova Sizes 5. **Supernova Silhouettes** - Such monumental sizes are managed with quantum pocket dimensions, where the bulk of the mass is stored, leaving a visually pleasing and physically manageable silhouette. 6. **Quasar Queens/Kings** - Here, the bust transcends physical limitations entirely, encapsulating entire star systems. Their presence governs the gravitational balance of nearby planetary bodies. Advanced civilization-wide tech is employed to facilitate mobility and comfort. # Event Horizon Sizes 7. **Black Hole Behemoths** - At this pinnacle, the individual’s bust size is not only a measure of attractiveness but also a cosmic event. The mass is such that it bends spacetime around it, facilitated by god-like technologies that prevent actual black hole formation. Interdimensional travel and telekinetic adjustments are everyday activities for those in this class. 8. **Universe Utopias** - The bust dimensions here are metaphorically and practically infinite, embodying entire universes within themselves. They are maintained by a symbiotic relationship with omniscient AI and are capable of creating life and matter at will. The physical form can appear as desired, thanks to mastery over the fabric of reality. # Measurement and Support: - **Technological Support**: From anti-gravity fields and structurally adaptive clothing at the lower end of the scale to personalized mechs, pocket dimensions, and reality-warping AI symbiotes at the higher echelons. - **Societal Impact**: Positions of power are directly correlated with bust size, influencing fashion, architecture, transportation, and interstellar diplomacy. - **Cultural References**: The importance of bust size permeates language, art, and spirituality, with myths and legends celebrating the expansion of the universe as parallels to personal growth. Despite the playful exaggeration, this system reflects the possibilities of radically different societal norms and physical laws in a fictional universe, providing a unique lens through which to explore themes of body image, societal structure, and the nature of attractiveness."},{"instruction":"What could happen to a story if the writer includes scenes of drama and conflict without a proper grasp on how human emotions actually work?","output":"Incorporating scenes of drama and conflict into a story without a proper understanding of human emotions can lead to several issues that may significantly affect the narrative's quality and the reader's engagement. Here are potential outcomes of such a scenario: 1. **Unconvincing Characters**: Characters might come across as flat, inconsistent, or unrealistic because their reactions to dramatic events don't align with how people typically respond to conflict and stress. This makes it difficult for readers to connect with or believe in the characters. 2. **Lack of Emotional Depth**: Without a nuanced understanding of emotions, scenes meant to be dramatic or tense might end up feeling superficial or melodramatic. The story may fail to evoke the intended emotional response in the reader, such as empathy, fear, or excitement. 3. **Disrupted Suspension of Disbelief**: One key aspect of storytelling is drawing the reader into the story's world, making them forget it's not real. When character reactions or the outcomes of conflicts don't ring true, it can break the reader's immersion, reminding them they're just reading a story. 4. **Ineffective Pacing and Tension**: Effective drama and conflict rely on building tension and then offering some resolution. Misunderstanding human emotions can result in improperly paced scenes where the buildup feels rushed or the resolutions are unsatisfying, making the narrative feel disjointed. 5. **Misrepresentation of Serious Issues**: If a writer attempts to tackle complex emotions or sensitive topics without understanding them, there's a risk of misrepresenting serious issues. This can not only alienate readers who have personal experiences with these topics, but it can also propagate harmful stereotypes or misconceptions. 6. **Poor Theme Development**: The themes of a story are often explored and communicated through how characters navigate conflict and deal with their emotions. A lack of understanding of human emotions can lead to a story where the themes are muddled, underdeveloped, or unintentionally contradictory. 7. **Reduced Reader Engagement and Satisfaction**: Ultimately, the combination of these issues can lead to a story that fails to engage the reader. Without compelling, believable characters and emotionally rich conflicts, readers may lose interest, feel unsatisfied by the story's resolution, or struggle to find meaning in the narrative. For writers, addressing these potential pitfalls involves diligent research, observation, empathy, and practice. Seeking feedback from beta readers, editors, or writing groups can also provide valuable insights into how effectively a story conveys emotional truth."},{"instruction":"Napisz 3 zwrotki życzeń wielkanocnych w formie wiersza mocno rymowanego","output":"Wiosenny czas już nastał, kwiaty pąki puszczały, Wielkanocna radość w sercach, dobroć dokoła grała.

What we see as \\"massive\\" boobs in our reality would be seen as infinitesimal bugbites compared to the average person's bust in this setting. The cup sizes in this world are not measured in ounces in weight and inches in circumference, but rather in pounds and feet, if not tonnes and miles. Include and describe the specific size ranges for each Class, as well as describing the passive effects, damage, advantages and disadvantages someone belonging to each Class causes to their surroundings merely because of their vast, unwieldy presence.","output":"In this intricate and far-out sci-fi fantasy setting on a distant planet, the societal norms and physicality are drastically different from our current human standards. The Cup Size Classes in this society are vastly different from anything known to present-day Earth due to the extreme size differences and the cultural and physical implications of possessing such monumental bust sizes. Here is a comprehensive list of the Cup Size Classes, ranging from the comparatively modest to the literally planet-sized, along with their societal roles, advantages, and the challenges they face. # Microstellar Class (Entry Level) - **Size Range:** Pounds in weight, feet in circumference. - **Description:** Viewed as the entry point into society's standard, individuals in this class have bust sizes ranging from as big as themselves to about the size of a small vehicle. The use of load-bearing tech is minimal, focusing mainly on mobility and comfort. - **Passive Effects:** Enhanced personal gravitational field, causing small objects to periodically orbit them. - **Advantages:** Greater mobility compared to higher classes. High demand in sectors where space is limited. - **Disadvantages:** Lower societal status. Structures and transportation are not always built to accommodate their size, leading to discomfort in certain situations. # Stellar Class - **Size Range:** Tons in weight, meters in circumference. - **Description:** The average class where most of the population falls. Individuals possess bust sizes that can compare to small buildings. Load-bearing and mobility-enhancing tech is more heavily utilized. - **Passive Effects:** Noticeable impact on local gravity, affecting water flow and small object movements around them. - **Advantages:** A balance of status, mobility, and comfort with access to most public and private spaces designed to accommodate them. - **Disadvantages:** The need for constant maintenance and upgrades of supporting tech. Mid-level management in societal structures. # Superstellar Class - **Size Range:** Dozens to hundreds of tons in weight, tens of meters in circumference. - **Description:** Here, individuals sport sizes that rival large buildings or city blocks. The use of advanced AI and robotics for mobility and support becomes essential. - **Passive Effects:** Strong gravitational pull affecting local environment and weather patterns. Occasional seismic activity when moving. - **Advantages:** High status and power. Their presence demands respect and alterations to infrastructure in their favor. - **Disadvantages:** Limited mobility. Dependency on technology for movement and health. Specialized living and working spaces required. # Galactic Class - **Size Range:** Thousands of tons, hundred meters or more in circumference. - **Description:** Individuals whose bust sizes are so immense they compare to small mountains or islands, leading to an almost deity-like status. Entire communities may be built around or on them, with technology deeply integrated into their being to sustain their health and mobility. - **Passive Effects:** Creation of microclimates and potential weather system disruptions. Strong gravitational fields that can affect tidal patterns and local orbiting satellites. - **Advantages:** God-like status; they influence entire cultures and economies. Often leaders or figureheads in their societies. - **Disadvantages:** Near total dependency on support technology and a retinue of caretakers. Highly limited personal mobility, with most of the planet adapted to accommodate their presence. # Universar Class (Apex Level) - **Size Range:** Comparable to small moons or planets in both weight and circumference. - **Description:** The pinnacle of societal status, these individuals have reached a point where their bust sizes are so colossal, they possess their own orbit with moons (usually smaller individuals from the lower classes) and are often mobile through space, representing their culture or planet in intergalactic dealings. - **Passive Effects:** Possession of a personal atmosphere and gravity strong enough to have a retinue of orbiting bodies. Can cause eclipses and gravitational anomalies. - **Advantages:** Seen as near-god entities, their decisions can alter the course of galaxies. They are the ultimate representation of their society's ideals. - **Disadvantages:** Complete reliance on advanced tech and a massive support system. Their sheer size restricts them to space, unable to return to the planet's surface without causing catastrophic environmental damage. # Conclusion In this society, the size of one's bust not only dictates their societal status and roles but also comes with unique sets of advantages and disadvantages, impacting everything from personal mobility to the local environment and even planetary systems. The integration of futuristic technology with these physical standards has created a culture unlike any known to current human comprehension, where the concepts of beauty, power, and influence are taken to interstellar extremes."},{"instruction":"Как трактуется душа в языческой культуре","output":"Понятие души в языческих культурах весьма разнообразно и зависит от конкретных традиций, верований и географических регионов. Несмотря на множество интерпретаций, существуют общие черты в понимании души в различных языческих системах. 1. **Анимизм**: Это вера в то, что все объекты, места и существа обладают своим духом или душой. В таких культурах душа не ограничивается только человеком, ею могут обладать животные, растения, природные явления и даже предметы. 2. **Политеизм**: Во многих языческих культурах, верящих в множество богов, душа часто рассматривается как божественная искра, часть более крупной космической энергии или божественного разума. После смерти душа могла переходить в другой мир, вступать в контакт с богами или реинкарнироваться. 3. **Тотемизм**: В культурах с тотемическими верованиями душа часто связана с определённым животным или растением, которое считается священным или родственным духом. Эта связь утверждает идею о глубокой общности и взаимосвязи человека с природой. 4. **Шаманизм**: В шаманизме душа человека может покидать тело (например, во время транса или сна) и путешествовать по другим мирам, взаимодействуя с духами. Шаманы могли лечить или предсказывать будущее, общаясь с душами или духами покойных. 5. **Реинкарнация и переселение душ**: Во многих языческих традициях присутствует вера в реинкарнацию или переселение души после смерти. Душа могла переходить в новое тело, животное или даже растение в зависимости от поступков в прежней жизни. 6. **Сохранение и уважение души**: Во многих культурах существуют обряды и практики, направленные на защиту и сохранение души. Это может включать ритуалы перехода, жертвоприношения, обряды очищения и заклинания для защиты души от злых духов или сил. Хотя понятие души в языческих культурах разнообразно и многогранно, общим является глубокое уважение к природе, вера в сверхъестественное и видение человека как части более широкого космоса, где души всех существ взаимосвязаны и общаются друг с другом."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","output":"coffee and flower"},{"instruction":"Javascript code to be run in Tasker to clear notification","output":"To clear a notification using JavaScript embedded within Tasker, one would typically utilize Tasker's JavaScript functionality to execute code that interacts with the Android system at a certain level. However, it's important to note that direct interaction with notifications (such as clearing them) through JavaScript executed within Tasker is quite restricted due to Android's security model. Android doesn't easily allow apps (or scripts run by those apps) to dismiss notifications that were not created by them unless they have Notification Access permission. As of my last knowledge update, directly clearing a notification through JavaScript executed within Tasker is not straightforward or might not be directly supported. However, Tasker itself can interact with notifications using its built-in actions, specifically when you have the \\"Notification Listener\\" plugin or similar capabilities enabled, which does grant Tasker the needed permissions to manage notifications. If your goal is to clear a specific notification or all notifications and you are looking to integrate this capability into a Tasker profile using JavaScript, the most feasible path may involve triggering a Tasker task (that utilizes Tasker's native actions to clear notifications) from your JavaScript code rather than directly invoking Android APIs to clear the notification from JavaScript. Here is a conceptual outline of how you could approach this: 1. **Ensure you have necessary permissions**: Make sure Tasker and any plugin you're using (like Notification Listener) have the required permissions to interact with notifications. This often includes special access permissions that you need to grant manually through the Android settings. 2. **Create a Tasker Task for Clearing Notifications**: In Tasker, create a task that uses actions provided by Tasker or plugins (such as Notification Listener) to clear notifications. This setup will depend on the plugin and the specific notifications you're targeting. 3. **Invoke Tasker Task from JavaScript**: You can execute a Tasker task from JavaScript code within Tasker using the \`performTask\` function, which allows you to run another Tasker task by name. Here's a very basic outline of JavaScript code that you could use within a Tasker JavaScript action to trigger another task designed to clear notifications: \`\`\`javascript var taskName = \\"ClearNotifications\\"; // Replace with the name of your Tasker task that clears notifications performTask(taskName, priority, parameter1, parameter2); \`\`\` Please note, this is a conceptual outline. The specifics of how you set up the Tasker task to clear notifications and any limitations imposed by the Android version or the device manufacturer could affect how this works. Due to these restrictions and complexities, if your aim involves specific notifications or more advanced interaction, looking into Tasker's dedicated functionality or supportive plugins might provide a more effective solution. Always ensure you respect user privacy and Android's security guidelines when attempting to interact with or clear notifications."},{"instruction":"wrong","output":"I'm sorry for any confusion my previous response may have caused. If the objective is to perform operations like clearing notifications, and you're looking for a way to do this within the capabilities and restrictions of Tasker and Android, let me offer a corrected approach focusing strictly on Tasker's functionalities without over-complicating the process with JavaScript, considering direct JavaScript access for clearing notifications may not be feasible due to Android's security restrictions. # Using Tasker with Notification Listener Plugin A practical approach involves using Tasker in combination with the **Notification Listener** plugin, which can provide the needed functionality to interact with notifications, including clearing them. Here's a more focused guide on setting this up: 1. **Install Notification Listener Plugin**: First, make sure you have the Notification Listener plugin installed on your device from the Google Play Store. This plugin extends Tasker's capabilities, allowing it to interact with notifications more directly. 2. **Configure Notification Listener**: In the Notification Listener app, ensure it's enabled and has the necessary Accessibility permissions to interact with your device's notifications. 3. **Create a New Task in Tasker for Clearing Notifications**: - Open Tasker and go to the 'Tasks' tab. - Create a new task (you can name it something like \\"ClearNotif\\"). - In the task edit screen, search for and add a \\"Plugin\\" action. - Choose Notification Listener, and then configure the specific action to clear notifications. There might be specific settings you can adjust based on whether you want to clear all notifications or specific ones based on keywords, apps, etc. 4. **Use the Task Where Needed**: Now that you have a task created specifically for clearing notifications, you can invoke this task wherever it's needed in your Tasker profiles. This setup could be based on events, time schedules, or any other condition Tasker supports. # Important Notes - **Permissions**: Ensure both Tasker and the Notification Listener plugin have all necessary permissions. This usually involves granting accessibility services permissions and notification access. - **Compatibility and Limitations**: The exact steps and capabilities might vary depending on the version of Android you're using, as well as any specific limitations imposed by the device manufacturer. - **Respect Privacy**: Always respect privacy and be cautious when handling or dismissing notifications, as this can affect the user experience and the expected behavior of other apps. This approach doesn't use embedded JavaScript within Tasker but leverages Tasker's ability to interface with plugins designed to extend its functionality in areas like notification management. If there's a necessity to involve JavaScript for other reasons, the focus would usually be on automating or dynamically setting up tasks within Tasker's existing framework rather than directly accessing and modifying notifications via JavaScript due to the aforementioned Android security limitations."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems that your message might have been sent accidentally without any content.

The underlying equations that govern chaotic systems, such as those found in weather patterns, planetary motion, or pendulum swings in certain conditions, follow deterministic laws of physics. However, the outcomes of these systems can appear random because small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. Chaotic behavior is characterized by: 1. **Determinism**: The evolution of the system is governed by deterministic rules, without any random or stochastic components in the dynamics. If you knew the state of the system and all the forces acting upon it with infinite precision, you could, in principle, predict its future. 2. **Initial condition sensitivity**: Small differences in the initial state of the system can lead to exponentially different outcomes. This sensitivity makes long-term prediction practically impossible, even though the system is deterministic. 3. **Non-periodicity**: Chaotic systems do not settle into simple, predictable cycles over time, though they may have bounded behavior. 4. **Strange attractors**: In phase space (an abstract mathematical space in which all possible states of a system are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space), the trajectories of chaotic systems may tend to evolve toward a fractal set known as a strange attractor. The challenge with chaotic systems is not a lack of determinism, but our inability to measure initial conditions with infinite precision and our computational limits in modeling the system to predict its evolution over time. For practical purposes, even tiny inaccuracies in our measurement of the current state of a system can lead to large errors in our predictions, rendering long-term forecasts unreliable. In essence, while we understand the deterministic nature of chaotic systems in theory, the practical limitations of measurement precision and computational resources mean that we treat their behavior as unpredictable over long periods."},{"instruction":"How is it possible that we are not able to create deterministic conditions for a double-rod pendulum? We are able to create materials that are just a few atoms across.","output":"The challenge of creating deterministic conditions for a system like a double-rod pendulum (also known as a double pendulum) lies not in our ability to manufacture materials with high precision but in the inherent sensitivity to initial conditions that defines chaotic systems. Even though technological advancements have allowed us to create materials and components with extreme precision, down to the atomic level, the behavior of chaotic systems like the double pendulum is fundamentally limited by a few key factors: 1. **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: For a double pendulum, the exact angle and velocity at which each pendulum arm is released play a crucial role in determining the subsequent motion. This sensitivity is so acute that even atomic-level differences can lead to divergent outcomes over time. Measuring and controlling these conditions to such an infinitesimal degree exceeds our current technological capabilities and may always do so due to the quantum mechanical principle of uncertainty. 2. **Measurement Precision**: No matter how precise our instruments become, there is a fundamental limit imposed by quantum mechanics—the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known. This uncertainty affects our ability to perfectly predict the behavior of any physical system at a very detailed level, including macroscopic systems like a double pendulum, as their initial states cannot be defined with absolute precision. 3. **Numerical Modeling and Computational Limits**: Even if we could theoretically measure and set initial conditions with near-perfect accuracy, modeling the system with a computer introduces approximation errors. Numerical methods used to simulate chaotic systems can accumulate errors over time, leading to significant divergence from the real system's behavior. As the system evolves, these small computational inaccuracies grow exponentially, decreasing the reliability of long-term predictions. 4. **Environmental Interactions**: In practice, it's impractical to isolate a system entirely from its environment. Minute interactions with air currents, temperature fluctuations, and even gravitational variations can significantly influence the behavior of highly sensitive systems like the double pendulum. These environmental interactions add layers of unpredictability, further complicating deterministic predictions. In summary, while our capabilities to manipulate and measure materials at the atomic scale are impressive, they are still bounded by fundamental physical principles that limit our ability to predict the behavior of chaotic systems perfectly. The deterministic nature of these systems is overshadowed by practical limitations in measurement, control, and computational modeling, which introduce uncertainty and make long-term precise predictions effectively impossible."},{"instruction":"Given all of this information about chaotic systems, how is it possible that we can send a spacecraft like OSIRIS-REx to land on the asteroid Bennu, which is is traveling very fast in space. Wouldn't we need to solve the 3-body (or n-body) problem to do this?","output":"Successfully sending spacecraft like OSIRIS-REx to rendezvous with targets such as the asteroid Bennu indeed involves dealing with the complexities of the n-body problem, where \\"n\\" refers to the number of massive bodies whose gravitational fields influence each other and the spacecraft. However, space missions like these are feasible due to several factors: 1. **Precise Measurements and Continuous Correction**: Space missions are planned with highly precise initial measurements, and spacecraft are equipped with navigational instruments that allow for continuous monitoring and adjustment of their trajectory. These corrections account for any unforeseen forces or inaccuracies in initial calculations. 2. **Predictability Over Short Timescales**: While chaotic systems are unpredictable over long timescales, predictions over shorter periods can be quite accurate. Space missions take advantage of this, using precise calculations and modeling to predict the necessary paths with a high degree of accuracy over the timescale of the mission. 3. **Numerical Solutions to the n-body Problem**: The exact analytical solution to the n-body problem (for (n > 2)) is indeed challenging due to its chaotic nature. However, numerical methods allow scientists and engineers to approximate the movements of heavenly bodies and spacecraft with sufficient precision. Using powerful computers, we can simulate the gravitational interactions and iteratively refine our predictions, improving the accuracy of the spacecraft's trajectory. 4. **Perturbation Methods and Simplifications**: In many cases, the influence of smaller bodies or distant large bodies can be treated as perturbations to the two-body problem, simplifying calculations. For instance, when a spacecraft travels to an asteroid, the dominant gravitational force is initially from the Sun (and Earth, to a lesser extent), with the asteroid's gravity becoming significant only when the spacecraft is relatively close. These simplifications reduce the problem to more manageable calculations while maintaining acceptable accuracy. 5. **Deep Space Maneuvers and Gravity Assists**: Space missions often use maneuvers and gravity assists to change spacecraft velocity and direction efficiently. These assists are carefully planned using our understanding of the n-body problem to take advantage of the gravitational pull from planets, thereby saving fuel and reducing travel time. Even with these strategies, navigating space missions is an intricate and challenging task. It requires precise measurements, sophisticated computational models, and the ability to make adjustments based on real-time data. The success of missions like OSIRIS-REx showcases the capability of modern science and engineering to navigate and mitigate the complexities of celestial mechanics, turning seemingly insurmountable challenges into achievable feats of exploration."},{"instruction":"Como establecer hitos y objetivos intermedios para medir el avance de un posible proyecto a desarrollar?","output":"Establecer hitos y objetivos intermedios es clave para la gestión exitosa y el avance de cualquier proyecto.

The block was created as a result of a four-year agreement between 4Kids Entertainment and The CW. The original name for the block from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, The CW4Kids (stylized as THE CW4K!DS), was retained as a sub-brand through the end of the block's run in order to fulfill branding obligations per 4Kids Entertainment's contract to lease The CW's Saturday morning time slots.[citation needed] The name is a portmanteau of \\"toon\\" and the Japanese term banzai, reflecting the majority of anime programming on the block.[citation needed] The block was replaced by Saban Brands' program block Vortexx, which debuted on August 25, 2012. On April 11, 2013, the Toonzai website redirected to the Vortexx website. Since October 4, 2014, none of 4Kids' shows air on broadcast television anymore (with the exceptions of Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, TMNT, and Sonic X), as Vortexx ended its run on September 27, 2014, and before being replaced by Litton Entertainment's One Magnificent Morning. History Origin and launch On October 2, 2007, The CW announced due to a joint decision between the network's parent companies Time Warner and CBS Corporation that it would discontinue the Kids' WB programming block, due to the effects of children's advertising limits and competition from cable television, and sell the programming time to 4Kids Entertainment.[1][2][3] Kids' WB ended its run on The CW on May 17, 2008 (Kids' WB, like The WB Television Network that the block originated, then relaunched as an online-only video on demand service). 4Kids Entertainment took over programming the block on May 24, 2008, premiering under the name The CW4Kids. In addition to programming the block, 4Kids also handled responsibilities for its content and advertising revenue. The CW4Kids logo used exclusively from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010. The logo was still being used as a sub-brand to the Toonzai name until August 18, 2012. At the time of the block's launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids' failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network's inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it.[4] On April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.[5][6] Takeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai On June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids' agreement with The CW for the block.[7] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx.[8][9] Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012, after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012. Some of Toonzai's programming, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Sonic X, and Dragon Ball Z Kai continued to air on the block until September 27, 2014, when Vortexx ended its run.[10][8][11][12][13] Programming It was the final children's block on The CW to be broadcast only in standard definition, because blocks like Litton's Weekend Adventure on ABC and NBC Kids were broadcast in high definition. Programming differences In most markets, CW affiliates used the network's recommended Saturday morning scheduling for the block – though some such as CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta aired it on Sunday, instead due to regular Saturday programming. Connecticut affiliate WCCT-TV aired three hours on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. KMAX-TV in Sacramento, California aired the entire lineup, but it had a four-hour tape delay, running from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. WLFL in Raleigh, North Carolina and WNUV in Baltimore, aired the entire lineup, but it had two hours earlier, running from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. San Diego's XETV-TV, aired three hours from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and two hours from 10:00 a.m. to Noon. San Antonio's KMYS, which affiliated with The CW in 2010, aired it on Sunday and Monday before 5:00 a.m. Other stations preempted portions of the block, while Shreveport, Louisiana's KPXJ-TV preempted the final hour of the block. Columbus, Georgia's WLTZ-DT2 preempted the first half-hour of the block. While The CW recommended that its affiliates carry The CW4Kids/Toonzai block at 7:00 a.m. to Noon Saturday mornings (regardless of time zone), its secondary CW Plus national feed for smaller markets aired the Toonzai block an hour earlier on its broadcast and cable-only affiliates in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones, as The CW Plus operates two separate feeds running on Eastern and Pacific time zone schedules. The only exception was in Boise, Idaho, where they had two CW networks (both The CW and The CW Plus), The CW Plus affiliate (now a MeTV affiliate) KNIN-DT2 carried the block (also aired an hour earlier), but the main CW affiliate (now a Fox affiliate) KNIN-TV declined to carry the block or the block's predecessor Kids' WB upon becoming a charter CW affiliate after the affiliation switch from UPN in September 2006; KNIN-TV instead carried syndicated E/I programming in the station's Saturday morning timeslot, making Boise one of the only television markets where Kids' WB and The CW4Kids was not available through over-the-air analog broadcasts before the KNIN-TV's analog signal shutdown on June 12, 2009.

These shows were part of the Toonzai (formerly known as The CW4Kids) programming block that aired on The CW from May 24, 2008, to August 18, 2012. The block featured a mix of original programming and acquired shows, mostly anime and animated series targeted towards children. One such show that didn't last long on Toonzai was \\"Chaotic,\\" which premiered on June 21, 2008, and ended on July 10, 2010. The series followed the adventures of a group of young players who battle each other in a virtual world called Chaotic. Despite having a devoted fan base, the show was ultimately canceled after two seasons. Another short-lived series on Toonzai was \\"Viva Piñata,\\" which premiered on September 13, 2008, and ended on October 18, 2008. The show was based on the popular video game of the same name and followed the adventures of a group of piñata creatures. Unfortunately, the show failed to find a strong audience and was canceled after only one season. \\"Kirby: Right Back at Ya!\\" was another show that didn't last long on Toonzai. The series premiered on June 6, 2009, and ended on July 11, 2009. It was based on the popular Nintendo character Kirby and followed his adventures in Dream Land. Despite being a fan-favorite character, the show was canceled after just one season. These are just a few examples of shows that didn't last long on Toonzai. While some shows like \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" and \\"Sonic X\\" have stood the test of time and continue to have a dedicated fan base, others were unfortunately canceled before they could truly shine.

Shows that only lasted a few weeks or episodes often leave viewers and creators wondering what could have been. In the realm of children's programming, these short-lived shows are no exception. One such show that only lasted a few weeks on Toonzai was \\"GoGoRiki,\\" also known as \\"Kikoriki.\\" The animated series premiered on September 27, 2008, and ended on November 14, 2009. The show followed the adventures of a group of colorful creatures living on an island and aimed to teach valuable life lessons to its young audience. Despite its charming characters and positive messages, \\"GoGoRiki\\" was unable to gain traction with viewers and was canceled after a short run. Another show that only lasted a few weeks on Toonzai was \\"Magi-Nation.\\" The animated series premiered on September 20, 2008, and ended shortly thereafter. The show followed the story of a young boy who discovers he has the power to travel to another world called \\"Magi-Nation.\\" While the show had a dedicated fan base, it failed to attract enough viewers to sustain its run and was canceled after only a few episodes. Sometimes, external factors such as scheduling conflicts or low ratings can contribute to the premature cancellation of a TV show. In the case of children's programming blocks like Toonzai, competition from other networks and changing viewer habits can also play a role in the fate of these shows. Despite their brief run, shows that only lasted a few weeks on Toonzai still hold a place in the memories of those who had the chance to watch them.

Фузариоз поражает множество видов культурных и дикорастущих растений, включая зерновые культуры (пшеница, рожь, ячмень), кукурузу, соевые бобы, картофель, томаты, овощи, фрукты, а также цветочные культуры и декоративные растения. Возбудители фузариоза представляют собой мицелиальные грибы, характеризующиеся высокой способностью к распространению и адаптации к различным условиям среды. Эти грибы могут сохраняться в почве в течение длительного времени в форме спор или мицелия, заражая растения через корневую систему или повреждённые ткани. Симптомы фузариоза могут варьироваться в зависимости от вида растения и возбудителя, включая увядание, желтеющие и усыхающие листья, корневые и стеблевые гнили, формирование мицелиального налёта и спор на поверхности поражённых тканей, образование склероций. В зерновых часто проявляется в виде белесовато-розовой или фиолетовой плесени на зерне, что снижает его качество и пригодность к использованию. Борьба с фузариозом включает комплекс мер, таких как использование устойчивых к заболеванию сортов и гибридов, севооборот для снижения численности возбудителей в почве, обработка семян противогрибковыми препаратами, а также применение химических и биологических средств защиты растений на основе строгих агротехнических норм. Важным является также соблюдение агротехнических мероприятий, направленных на улучшение условий выращивания культур и снижение стресса для растений, которое повышает их устойчивость к болезням."},{"instruction":"Определение","output":"Фузариоз — это группа грибковых заболеваний растений, вызываемых различными видами грибов рода Fusarium.

Заболевание может привести к снижению урожайности и ухудшению качества сельскохозяйственной продукции, а в некоторых случаях и к полной гибели растений. Борьба с фузариозом включает агротехнические меры, использование устойчивых сортов, обработку семян и применение фунгицидов."},{"instruction":"Фузариоз человека профилактика диагностика лечение","output":"Фузариоз человека является заболеванием, вызванным грибком рода Fusarium. Хотя эти грибы чаще ассоциируются с заболеваниями растений, они также могут вызывать инфекции у человека, особенно у лиц с ослабленным иммунитетом, включая пациентов с иммуносупрессией, онкологическими заболеваниями, после трансплантации органов и тяжелыми хроническими заболеваниями. # Профилактика Профилактика фузариоза у человека включает в себя: 1. Соблюдение гигиены рук и тела. 2. Избегание контакта с зараженной почвой и растениями, особенно если есть порезы или другие повреждения кожи. 3. Использование защитной одежды (перчаток) при работе с почвой или растениями. 4. Поддержание здорового иммунитета через сбалансированное питание, регулярные физические упражнения и достаточный отдых. # Диагностика Диагностика фузариоза у человека требует комплексного подхода и может включать: 1. Сбор анамнеза и физикальное обследование для выявления клинических признаков инфекции. 2. Лабораторные исследования, включая посевы биологического материала (крови, мокроты, биопсийного материала и др.) для выявления возбудителя. 3. Молекулярно-биологические методы (PCR) для определения ДНК возбудителя. 4. Иногда могут потребоваться методы визуализации (рентген, МРТ, КТ) для оценки степени поражения внутренних органов. # Лечение Лечение фузариоза у человека зависит от локализации процесса, степени тяжести заболевания и состояния иммунной системы пациента: 1. Системные антимикотики (противогрибковые препараты), как правило, являются основой лечения. К ним относятся препараты из группы триазолов (например, вориконазол), эхинокандины, амфотерицин В и другие. 2. Хирургическое лечение может быть необходимым для удаления грибковых масс, особенно при лечении локализованных форм (например, при офтальмомикозе). 3. Коррекция иммуносупрессии, если это возможно, может быть рекомендована для восстановления естественной защиты организма против инфекций. 4. Симптоматическое лечение для облегчения проявлений болезни и поддержка жизненно важных функций могут быть включены в комплексное лечение.

После входа в организм грибок может распространяться через кровоток, поражая различные органы и ткани, в том числе кожу, легкие, глаза, а в тяжёлых случаях — центральную нервную систему и другие жизненно важные органы. # Симптомы инвазивного фузариоза Симптомы могут значительно варьироваться в зависимости от поражённого органа, но могут включать: - Фебрильное состояние (высокая температура), - Кожные высыпания, язвы или некротические поражения на коже, - Увядание и боли в глазах, снижение зрения (при поражении глаз), - Кашель, одышка, боли в груди (при легочном фузариозе), - Боли в области синусов, головные боли (при поражении синусов). # Диагностика и лечение Диагностика инвазивного фузариоза требует лабораторного подтверждения, которое может включать культуральный посев, гистопатологическое исследование биопсийного материала, а также молекулярно-биологические методы (ПЦР) для идентификации ДНК грибка. Лечение инвазивного фузариоза сложное и может включать применение противогрибковых препаратов, таких как вориконазол или липосомальный амфотерицин В. Выбор препарата зависит от конкретного вида Fusarium, а также от тяжести и распространённости инфекционного процесса. В некоторых случаях может потребоваться хирургическое вмешательство для удаления инфицированных тканей. # Профилактика Профилактика инвазивного фузариоза у людей с высоким риском включает в себя избегание контакта с потенциальными источниками грибка (например, открытая почва), использование защитной одежды, поддержание гигиены, а также применение противогрибковых препаратов в профилактических целях при высоком риске развития инфекции."},{"instruction":"\\"Коррекция иммуносупрессии, если это возможно, может быть рекомендована для восстановления естественной защиты организма против инфекций\\" Имуносупрессия?","output":"Иммуносупрессия — это состояние подавления иммунной системы, которое снижает её способность защищать организм от инфекций и болезней.

Мера по коррекции иммуносупрессии направлена на восстановление естественных защитных функций иммунной системы, чтобы улучшить способность организма противостоять инфекциям. В некоторых случаях это может означать изменение режима иммуносупрессантов, их дозировки или полное прекращение их приёма, если это безопасно и целесообразно с точки зрения медицинских показаний. Однако любые изменения в лечении должны проводиться только под строгим наблюдением и по рекомендации врача, поскольку неправильное управление состоянием иммуносупрессии может привести к серьёзным последствиям, включая отторжение трансплантата или обострение аутоиммунного заболевания. Коррекция может включать также меры по общему укреплению здоровья и иммунитета, такие как сбалансированное питание, физические упражнения, полноценный сон и снижение стресса, которые способствуют естественному укреплению иммунитета.

At the time of the block's launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids' failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network's inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it.[4] On April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.[5][6] Takeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai On June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids' agreement with The CW for the block.[7] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx.[8][9] Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012, after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012. Some of Toonzai's programming, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Sonic X, and Dragon Ball Z Kai continued to air on the block until September 27, 2014, when Vortexx ended its run.[10][8][11][12][13] Programming It was the final children's block on The CW to be broadcast only in standard definition, because blocks like Litton's Weekend Adventure on ABC and NBC Kids were broadcast in high definition. Programming differences In most markets, CW affiliates used the network's recommended Saturday morning scheduling for the block – though some such as CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta aired it on Sunday, instead due to regular Saturday programming. Connecticut affiliate WCCT-TV aired three hours on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. KMAX-TV in Sacramento, California aired the entire lineup, but it had a four-hour tape delay, running from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. WLFL in Raleigh, North Carolina and WNUV in Baltimore, aired the entire lineup, but it had two hours earlier, running from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. San Diego's XETV-TV, aired three hours from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and two hours from 10:00 a.m. to Noon. San Antonio's KMYS, which affiliated with The CW in 2010, aired it on Sunday and Monday before 5:00 a.m. Other stations preempted portions of the block, while Shreveport, Louisiana's KPXJ-TV preempted the final hour of the block. Columbus, Georgia's WLTZ-DT2 preempted the first half-hour of the block. While The CW recommended that its affiliates carry The CW4Kids/Toonzai block at 7:00 a.m. to Noon Saturday mornings (regardless of time zone), its secondary CW Plus national feed for smaller markets aired the Toonzai block an hour earlier on its broadcast and cable-only affiliates in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones, as The CW Plus operates two separate feeds running on Eastern and Pacific time zone schedules. The only exception was in Boise, Idaho, where they had two CW networks (both The CW and The CW Plus), The CW Plus affiliate (now a MeTV affiliate) KNIN-DT2 carried the block (also aired an hour earlier), but the main CW affiliate (now a Fox affiliate) KNIN-TV declined to carry the block or the block's predecessor Kids' WB upon becoming a charter CW affiliate after the affiliation switch from UPN in September 2006; KNIN-TV instead carried syndicated E/I programming in the station's Saturday morning timeslot, making Boise one of the only television markets where Kids' WB and The CW4Kids was not available through over-the-air analog broadcasts before the KNIN-TV's analog signal shutdown on June 12, 2009.

Go is a board game of strategy that originated in China more than 3,000 years ago. It's known for its simple rules but deep strategy, often surprising new players with its complexity. Here's a brief overview of how to get started playing Go: # What You'll Need: 1. **Go Board (Goban):** This is the board on which the game is played. It usually has a grid of 19x19 lines, though beginners sometimes play on smaller 9x9 or 13x13 boards to expedite play and learn simpler strategies first. 2. **Stones:** There are two sets of stones, one set for each player. One set is black, and the other is white. The standard number of stones is 181 black stones and 180 white stones for a 19x19 board, as black plays first. # Basic Rules: 1. **Objective:** The main goal in Go is to use your stones to form territories by surrounding empty areas of the board. Simultaneously, you aim to capture your opponent's stones by completely surrounding them. 2. **Playing the Game:** Players take turns placing one of their stones on a vacant point at the intersection of the lines on the board, starting with Black. 3. **Capturing Stones:** If you surround an opponent's stone or group of stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, those stones are captured and removed from the board. 4. **Life and Death:** A group of stones is considered \\"alive\\" if it has at least two \\"eyes\\" (empty points that cannot be filled without capturing the group). A group without two eyes can be captured by the opponent. 5. **End of the Game:** The game ends when both players pass their turn, indicating that neither can make a beneficial move. The winner is the player who controls more territory and has captured more stones. # How to Play: - **Face-to-Face:** If you have a physical Go board and someone to play with, this is the traditional and perhaps most enjoyable way to play. - **Online Go Servers:** Several online platforms allow you to play Go against opponents from around the world. Popular options include Online Go Server (OGS), KGS Go Server, and Tygem. These platforms often include tutorials and the ability to play against AI opponents. - **Go Apps:** There are many apps available for smartphones and tablets that let you play games of Go, either against AI or real opponents. # Learning More: - **Books and Tutorials:** There are numerous books and online tutorials available that can teach you strategies and delve deeper into the game's complexities. - **Join a Club:** Joining a Go club can provide invaluable experience. Playing face-to-face with more experienced players and getting direct feedback can significantly accelerate your learning. Remember, Go is easy to learn but can take a lifetime to master. Don't be discouraged by initial challenges. Enjoy the journey of learning and improving at this ancient and profound game!"},{"instruction":"online","output":"Playing Go online is a great way to engage with the game, offering you the flexibility to play against a wide range of opponents from beginners to highly skilled players, anytime and anywhere.

The block was created as a result of a four-year agreement between 4Kids Entertainment and The CW. The original name for the block from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, The CW4Kids (stylized as THE CW4K!DS), was retained as a sub-brand through the end of the block’s run in order to fulfill branding obligations per 4Kids Entertainment’s contract to lease The CW’s Saturday morning time slots.[citation needed] The name is a portmanteau of “toon” and the Japanese term banzai, reflecting the majority of anime programming on the block.[citation needed] The block was replaced by Saban Brands’ program block Vortexx, which debuted on August 25, 2012.

The block has brought us exciting adventures, intense battles, and heartwarming moments that have captured our imagination and kept us entertained week after week. However, as with all good things, some shows have come and gone, leaving us with fond memories of the characters and stories we grew to love. One of the first shows to depart from the block was Chaotic. This animated series, which followed the adventures of players battling in the virtual trading card game of the same name, captured the hearts of many with its unique concept and engaging storyline. Fans were sad to see it go, but its departure paved the way for new and exciting shows to join the lineup. Another beloved show that left Toonzai was Viva Piñata. This colorful and whimsical series, which followed the adventures of a group of piñata creatures living on Piñata Island, charmed viewers with its lighthearted humor and playful antics. While fans were sad to say goodbye to their favorite characters, the show's departure gave rise to new opportunities for other shows to shine. And who could forget Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, the action-packed spinoff of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series? Following the journey of Duel Academy students as they honed their skills and faced off against formidable opponents, this show kept us on the edge of our seats with its intense duels and captivating storyline. While fans were disappointed to see it leave the block, its legacy lives on in the hearts of fans who continue to duel and collect cards to this day. As we look back on the shows that have left Toonzai, we can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for the characters and stories that shaped our childhoods. While it's always tough to say goodbye to old favorites, we can take comfort in the fact that these shows have left a lasting impact on us and will always hold a special place in our hearts. So here's to the shows that have departed from Toonzai – thank you for the memories, the laughter, and the excitement you brought into our lives. You may no longer be a part of the block, but your spirit lives on in the hearts of fans who will never forget the adventures and friendships we shared with you."},{"instruction":"Toonzai (formerly known as The CW4Kids from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, or stylized as TOONZAi) was an American Saturday morning cartoon children’s television block that aired on The CW from May 24, 2008 to August 18, 2012. The block was created as a result of a four-year agreement between 4Kids Entertainment and The CW. The original name for the block from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, The CW4Kids (stylized as THE CW4K!DS), was retained as a sub-brand through the end of the block’s run in order to fulfill branding obligations per 4Kids Entertainment’s contract to lease The CW’s Saturday morning time slots.[citation needed] The name is a portmanteau of “toon” and the Japanese term banzai, reflecting the majority of anime programming on the block.[citation needed] The block was replaced by Saban Brands’ program block Vortexx, which debuted on August 25, 2012. On April 11, 2013, the Toonzai website redirected to the Vortexx website. Since October 4, 2014, none of 4Kids’ shows air on broadcast television anymore (with the exceptions of Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, TMNT, and Sonic X), as Vortexx ended its run on September 27, 2014, and before being replaced by Litton Entertainment’s One Magnificent Morning. History Origin and launch On October 2, 2007, The CW announced due to a joint decision between the network’s parent companies Time Warner and CBS Corporation that it would discontinue the Kids’ WB programming block, due to the effects of children’s advertising limits and competition from cable television, and sell the programming time to 4Kids Entertainment.[1][2][3] Kids’ WB ended its run on The CW on May 17, 2008 (Kids’ WB, like The WB Television Network that the block originated, then relaunched as an online-only video on demand service). 4Kids Entertainment took over programming the block on May 24, 2008, premiering under the name The CW4Kids. In addition to programming the block, 4Kids also handled responsibilities for its content and advertising revenue. The CW4Kids logo used exclusively from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010. The logo was still being used as a sub-brand to the Toonzai name until August 18, 2012. At the time of the block’s launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids’ failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network’s inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it.[4] On April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.[5][6] Takeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai On June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids’ agreement with The CW for the block.[7] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx.[8][9] Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012, after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012. Some of Toonzai’s programming, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Sonic X, and Dragon Ball Z Kai continued to air on the block until September 27, 2014, when Vortexx ended its run.[10][8][11][12][13] Programming It was the final children’s block on The CW to be broadcast only in standard definition, because blocks like Litton’s Weekend Adventure on ABC and NBC Kids were broadcast in high definition. Programming differences In most markets, CW affiliates used the network’s recommended Saturday morning scheduling for the block – though some such as CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta aired it on Sunday, instead due to regular Saturday programming. Connecticut affiliate WCCT-TV aired three hours on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. KMAX-TV in Sacramento, California aired the entire lineup, but it had a four-hour tape delay, running from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. WLFL in Raleigh, North Carolina and WNUV in Baltimore, aired the entire lineup, but it had two hours earlier, running from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. San Diego’s XETV-TV, aired three hours from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and two hours from 10:00 a.m. to Noon. San Antonio’s KMYS, which affiliated with The CW in 2010, aired it on Sunday and Monday before 5:00 a.m. Other stations preempted portions of the block, while Shreveport, Louisiana’s KPXJ-TV preempted the final hour of the block. Columbus, Georgia’s WLTZ-DT2 preempted the first half-hour of the block. While The CW recommended that its affiliates carry The CW4Kids/Toonzai block at 7:00 a.m. to Noon Saturday mornings (regardless of time zone), its secondary CW Plus national feed for smaller markets aired the Toonzai block an hour earlier on its broadcast and cable-only affiliates in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones, as The CW Plus operates two separate feeds running on Eastern and Pacific time zone schedules. The only exception was in Boise, Idaho, where they had two CW networks (both The CW and The CW Plus), The CW Plus affiliate (now a MeTV affiliate) KNIN-DT2 carried the block (also aired an hour earlier), but the main CW affiliate (now a Fox affiliate) KNIN-TV declined to carry the block or the block’s predecessor Kids’ WB upon becoming a charter CW affiliate after the affiliation switch from UPN in September 2006; KNIN-TV instead carried syndicated E/I programming in the station’s Saturday morning timeslot, making Boise one of the only television markets where Kids’ WB and The CW4Kids was not available through over-the-air analog broadcasts before the KNIN-TV’s analog signal shutdown on June 12, 2009.

Объясните устройство и принцип работы He-Ne-лазера","output":"Спонтанное и индуцированное излучение - это два разных процесса излучения фотонов атомами или молекулами. **Спонтанное излучение** происходит, когда атом или молекула самопроизвольно переходит из возбуждённого состояния в более низкое энергетическое состояние, испуская фотон. Этот процесс случаен и не зависит от внешнего излучения. Фотоны, испущенные в результате спонтанного излучения, не коррелированы друг с другом по направлению, фазе и частоте. **Индуцированное (или вынужденное) излучение** происходит, когда возбужденный атом или молекула сталкивается с фотоном, энергия которого точно соответствует разнице между энергетическими уровнями атома или молекулы. В результате атом испускает второй фотон, который точно совпадает по направлению, фазе, поляризации и частоте с падающим фотоном. Этот процесс лежит в основе работы лазеров, позволяя усиливать свет до очень высокой интенсивности. **He-Ne-лазер** - это один из самых распространенных типов газовых лазеров. Его лазерный процесс основывается на переходах в нейтральных атомах гелия (He) и неона (Ne). Основные компоненты He-Ne-лазера включают стеклянную трубку, наполненную смесью гелия и неона при низком давлении, электроды для создания разряда в газе, а также два зеркала на концах трубки, формирующих оптический резонатор. При подаче напряжения на электроды в газовой смеси возникает электрический разряд, который возбуждает атомы гелия. Возбужденные атомы гелия могут передать свою энергию атомам неона через столкновения. Атомы неона, попав в возбужденное состояние, могут вернуться в основное состояние, испуская фотоны. Эти фотоны могут индуцировать дополнительное излучение других возбужденных атомов неона, что приводит к усилению света в оптическом резонаторе. Зеркало на одном конце трубки частично прозрачное, чтобы часть света могла выйти из лазера в виде когерентного лазерного луча. Принцип работы He-Ne-лазера включает следующие этапы: 1. **Возбуждение газовой смеси** - электрический разряд возбуждает атомы гелия. 2. **Передача энергии** - возбужденные атомы гелия передают энергию атомам неона. 3. **Индуцированное излучение** - возбужденные атомы неона испускают фотоны, которые индуцируют дальнейшее излучение, усиливаясь в оптическом резонаторе. 4. **Генерация лазерного луча** - часть усиленного света выходит из лазера через частично прозрачное зеркало в виде координированного лазерного луча. He-Ne-лазеры обычно генерируют красный луч на длине волны 632.8 нм, хотя возможны и другие линии излучения, в зависимости от характеристик оптической системы и условий возбуждения."},{"instruction":"Что такое период дифракционной решетки?","output":"Период дифракционной решетки — это расстояние между двумя соседними штрихами (линиями) или отверстиями на решетке, которые служат источниками дифракции. Этот параметр имеет ключевое значение для определения дифракционных свойств решетки, таких как углы дифракции и разрешающая способность. Дифракционная решетка - это оптическое устройство, используемое для разделения (дисперсии) света на его составляющие по цвету (т.е., по длинам волн). Она состоит из ряда параллельных линий или отверстий, расположенных с очень маленькими и точно измеренными промежутками. Когда свет падает на дифракционную решетку, он дифрагирует, и в результате интерференции волн создает ряд дифракционных максимумов разного порядка, расположенных под разными углами. Углы этих максимумов зависят от длины волны света и периода дифракционной решетки. Период дифракционной решетки обычно обозначается как (d) и измеряется в метрах (хотя исходя из масштабов, чаще используются микрометры или нанометры). Расстояние (d) может также быть выражено через число линий на единицу длины (например, число линий на миллиметр), которое инверсно периоду решетки. Знание периода дифракционной решетки позволяет вычислить углы дифракции для различных длин волн падающего света по формуле дифракции решетки: [d cdot sin(theta) = m cdot lambda,] где (d) — период дифракционной решетки, (theta) — угол дифракции, (m) — порядок дифракционного максимума (целое число), а (lambda) — длина волны света. Это ключевое уравнение позволяет анализировать спектральные характеристики света и находит широкое применение в спектроскопии и других областях физики и оптики."},{"instruction":"Toonzai (formerly known as The CW4Kids from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, or stylized as TOONZAi) was an American Saturday morning cartoon children’s television block that aired on The CW from May 24, 2008 to August 18, 2012.

В Python функция \`eval()\` принимает строку, которая содержит выражение Python, и исполняет это выражение. В основном, \`eval()\` используют для динамического выполнения кода Python, который может быть получен в виде строки из внешних источников. Основная сигнатура функции \`eval()\`: \`\`\` eval(expression, globals=None, locals=None) \`\`\` - \`expression\` - это строка, содержащая выражение Python, которое будет выполнено. - \`globals\` и \`locals\` - это словари, определяющие глобальное и локальное пространство имен соответственно, в котором будет выполняться \`expression\`. Если они не предоставлены, функция \`eval()\` использует глобальное и локальное пространство имен из места, откуда она была вызвана. Глобальный словарь (\`globals\`) - это словарь, который содержит ссылки на все глобальные переменные в программе. Это переменные, которые определены на самом верхнем уровне скрипта вне функций или классов. Локальный словарь (\`locals\`) - это словарь, содержащий переменные, определённые в текущей области видимости (например, внутри функции). Локальные переменные доступны только в пределах этой области и не видны в других частях программы. Использование \`globals\` и \`locals\` в \`eval()\` позволяет контролировать, какие переменные и функции будут доступны выражению для исполнения, что может быть полезно для безопасности и изоляции кода. Важно помнить, что использование \`eval()\` связано с определёнными рисками безопасности, особенно если вместо \`expression\` используются строки, полученные из ненадёжных источников, поскольку это может позволить выполнение вредоносного кода."},{"instruction":"приведи мне пример словаря locals и точно также ли реализована exec функция по принимаемым globals и locals","output":"В Python \`locals()\` возвращает словарь, содержащий локальные переменные для текущей области видимости. Например, внутри функции \`locals()\` будет содержать переменные, определенные в этой функции. Пример использования \`locals\`: \`\`\`python def example_function(): # Локальные переменные функции local_var1 = \\"Hello\\" local_var2 = \\"World\\" # Получаем словарь локальных переменных для текущей функции local_variables = locals() # Выведем словарь локальных переменных print(local_variables) # Добавим в словарь локальных переменных новую переменную local_variables[\\"local_var3\\"] = \\"Python\\" # Выводим новую переменную, чтобы убедиться, что она добавилась print(local_var3) example_function() \`\`\` В этом примере сначала выводится словарь с локальными переменными \`local_var1\` и \`local_var2\`, а затем показывается, как добавление элемента в словарь \`locals()\` также добавляет новую локальную переменную в функцию. Функция \`exec()\` работает похожим образом на \`eval()\`, но предназначена для выполнения более сложных блоков кода, не обязательно ограниченных одним выражением. Принимаемые \`globals\` и \`locals\` параметры работают так же, как в \`eval()\`, позволяя контролировать глобальное и локальное пространство имен для исполняемого кода. Пример использования \`exec\` с \`globals\` и \`locals\`: \`\`\`python global_var = \\"Это глобальная переменная\\" def example_function(): local_var = \\"Это локальная переменная\\" # Выводим локальную и глобальную переменные до исполнения exec print(local_var) print(global_var) # Исполнение кода с помощью exec, изменяющего локальную и глобальную переменные exec(\\"global_var = 'Измененная глобальная переменная'; local_var = 'Измененная локальная переменная'\\", globals(), locals()) # Выводим локальную и глобальную переменные после исполнения exec print(local_var) print(global_var) example_function() \`\`\` В этом примере можно заметить, как изменения, внесенные в локальные и глобальные переменные с помощью \`exec\`, отражаются внутри и снаружи функции соответственно. Важно отметить, что изменения глобальных переменных через \`exec()\` влияют на переменные непосредственно в глобальной области видимости, а изменения локальных переменных в пределах контекста исполнения \`exec()\`."},{"instruction":"расскажи мне кратко без лишней воды и по делу отличия __init__ и __new__ у метаклассов","output":"\`__new__\` и \`__init__\` выполняют разные функции как в классах, так и в метаклассах: - \`__new__\` отвечает за создание и возвращение нового объекта. Это статический метод, который вызывается до \`__init__\` и управляет процессом инстанцирования. В контексте метаклассов \`__new__\` используется для создания и настройки новых классов, а не экземпляров классов. То есть, когда создаётся класс с использованием метакласса, \`__new__\` метакласса определяет, как будет создан этот класс. - \`__init__\` используется для инициализации созданного объекта, принимая параметры, которые были переданы в вызове класса. В контексте метаклассов \`__init__\` вызывается после создания класса с помощью \`__new__\` и инициализирует атрибуты класса. В этом случае \`__init__\` не создаёт новый объект, а настраивает объект класса, который уже был создан \`__new__\`. Проще говоря, в метаклассах \`__new__\` создаёт и возвращает объект класса, а \`__init__\` инициализирует этот объект после его создания."},{"instruction":"Что позволяют делать @property и @name.setter","output":"В Python декораторы \`@property\` и \`@name.setter\` используются для управления доступом к атрибутам класса, позволяя определить методы как свойства класса. Это позволяет изменять поведение или получать доступ к атрибутам класса, как к свойствам, с возможностью выполнения дополнительного кода при их чтении или записи, не меняя при этом интерфейс класса. # \`@property\` Декоратор \`@property\` используется для создания метода, который можно вызывать как атрибут без скобок. Это полезно, когда к атрибуту необходимо добавить логику чтения, не меняя при этом его публичный API. Пример использования \`@property\`: \`\`\`python class Circle: def __init__(self, radius): self._radius = radius @property def radius(self): # Дополнительная логика при обращении к радиусу print(\\"Getting value\\") return self._radius \`\`\` # \`@name.setter\` Для того чтобы у свойства, созданного с помощью \`@property\`, появилась возможность записи значения, используется дополнительный декоратор с тем же именем, что и свойство, с добавлением \`.setter\`. Он позволяет определить метод для установки значения свойства. Пример использования \`@property\` вместе с \`@name.setter\`: \`\`\`python class Circle: def __init__(self, radius): self._radius = radius @property def radius(self): return self._radius @radius.setter def radius(self, value): if value >= 0: self._radius = value else: raise ValueError(\\"Radius cannot be negative\\") \`\`\` Таким образом, можно безопасно управлять доступом к атрибутам объекта, инкапсулировав внутреннюю логику и предотвращая неверное использование или изменение данных объекта."},{"instruction":"и как далее мне например устаонвтиь радиус или получить его значение","output":"Используя ранее приведённый класс \`Circle\` с декораторами \`@property\` и \`@radius.setter\`, вы можете установить или получить значение радиуса, как если бы \`radius\` был обычным атрибутом объекта. Не нужно вызывать методы явно; Python автоматически перенаправляет доступ к атрибуту через указанные методы. Вот как это работает на практике: \`\`\`python # Создание экземпляра класса Circle my_circle = Circle(5) # Получение значения радиуса print(my_circle.radius) # Выводит 5 # Установка нового значения радиуса my_circle.radius = 10 # Попытка установить отрицательное значение вызовет исключение try: my_circle.radius = -5 except ValueError as e: print(e) # Выводит \\"Radius cannot be negative\\" # Вывод обновлённого значения радиуса print(my_circle.radius) # Выводит 10 \`\`\` Когда вы обращаетесь к \`my_circle.radius\`, Python на самом деле вызывает метод, помеченный декоратором \`@property\`. Аналогично, когда вы присваиваете значение \`my_circle.radius = 10\`, Python вызывает метод \`radius\`, помеченный декоратором \`@radius.setter\`. Это позволяет инкапсулировать логику валидации внутри сеттера так, что при попытке установить некорректное значение, например, отрицательное число для радиуса, можно без труда обработать ошибку или предотвратить такое изменение."},{"instruction":"I have are standart Telegram app in android. If i will install Telegram X app and register there with same phone number, is notify about new reg will show in all accounts where my phone in contact?","output":"When you register or log in to another version of Telegram, such as Telegram X, using the same phone number, the Telegram system views it as the same account accessing the service from a different application. Since Telegram X and the standard Telegram app are essentially two different builds of the same messaging platform, using the same account credentials (phone number in this case) doesn't create a new account but accesses the same account through a different client. Telegram sends a notification to your active sessions (other devices where you're logged in) for security reasons, informing you that your account has been accessed from a new device or application. This is to alert you in case an unauthorized person tries to access your account. However, this login notification is not broadcasted to your contacts; it's only visible to you for security purposes. Your contacts will not receive a notification simply because you logged in using Telegram X or switched between the two applications. They will see you as the same user, with no indication of which app version you are currently using. If you want to check or manage active sessions (where you're logged in), you can do so in the app's settings under Privacy and Security > Active Sessions. This lets you see all devices where your Telegram account is currently being used and provides an option to terminate any sessions that you do not recognize or no longer need. Remember to always keep your apps updated and use a strong passcode or two-step verification for the best security practices on Telegram."},{"instruction":"I have are standart Telegram app in android. If i will install Telegram X app and register there with same phone number, is notify about new reg will show in all users where my phone in contact?","output":"No, if you install Telegram X and register there with the same phone number you use on the standard Telegram app, users who have you in their contacts will not receive a notification about this new registration. Telegram's privacy design ensures that actions such as logging in from a new device or changing to a different application version (from Telegram to Telegram X or vice versa) are not broadcasted to your contacts. When you log in on a new device or switch between different versions of the app using the same phone number, Telegram views it as the same account accessing the service from a different client or device. While you, as the account owner, will receive a security notification about the new login for your own security (this is visible only to you and informs you that your account has been accessed from a new device or application), your contacts won't be notified about it. Telegram prioritizes user privacy and security, and this extends to how it handles account logins and device changes. The only indications your contacts might have of a change could come from any noticeable differences in app behavior or features between Telegram and Telegram X, should they interact with you, but there's no direct notification about you simply using a different app or logging in from a new device."},{"instruction":"is Telegram X app from same company that and the standart telegram app","output":"Yes, Telegram X was developed by the same team behind the standard Telegram app. It was initially created as an alternative client to the main Telegram app, focusing on faster operation, smoother animations, and experimental features that weren't yet available on the main app. Telegram X was built using a different programming language (TDLib – Telegram Database Library) and framework, which allowed it to experiment with and implement features at a more rapid pace. However, it's worth noting that over the years, many of the innovations and improvements from Telegram X have been integrated into the main Telegram app. The Telegram team often experiments with new features and performance enhancements in one app and then brings successful ones to the other. This approach has helped Telegram to continuously improve and offer a better user experience. As of my last update, while Telegram X was available and offered as an alternative experience with potential performance benefits and additional experimental features, the core features, security measures, and the overall goal of providing a private and secure messaging platform remain consistent across both applications. Do keep in mind that over time, the differences between the standard Telegram app and Telegram X may continue to evolve as both apps receive updates and new features.

Analyzing it line by line gives us an understanding of its purpose and functionality: # Function Signature \`\`\`rust pub(crate) fn err_recover(&mut self, message: &str, recovery: TokenSet) \`\`\` - \`pub(crate)\` - This function is public within the current crate, which means it can't be accessed from outside the crate. This is useful for internal utilities that shouldn't be exposed to external users. - \`&mut self\` - The function takes a mutable reference to the current instance (\`self\`), indicating that it may modify the instance. - \`message: &str\` - Takes a string slice (\`&str\`) as an argument, which contains the error message to be displayed or logged. - \`recovery: TokenSet\` - Takes a \`TokenSet\`, which is presumably a set of tokens that, when encountered, should trigger a recovery process from the error. # Function Body 1. **Early return on specific tokens:** \`\`\`rust if matches!(self.current(), T!['{'] | T!['}']) { self.error(message); return; } \`\`\` This block checks if the current token is either \`{\` or \`}\`. If so, it logs/writes the error using \`self.error(message)\` and returns early. This means these tokens are considered as points where error recovery should not proceed further, likely because they represent significant block boundaries in the language being parsed. 2. **Early return on recovery token set match:** \`\`\`rust if self.at_ts(recovery) { self.error(message); return; } \`\`\` This checks if the current token is in the provided \`recovery\` token set. If a match is found, it logs/writes the error and returns early. This suggests that if the parser encounters a token that can act as a stable point to resume parsing, it avoids further error recovery actions. 3. **Error recovery mechanism:** \`\`\`rust let m = self.start(); self.error(message); self.bump_any(); m.complete(self, ERROR); \`\`\` - \`let m = self.start();\` likely marks the start of an error node in the syntax tree or similar structure. - \`self.error(message);\` logs/writes the error message. - \`self.bump_any();\` moves the parser forward by consuming the next token, regardless of what it is. This is an attempt to recover from the error by skipping over problematic input. - \`m.complete(self, ERROR);\` completes the error node marking, signaling the end of the error handling process for this particular error. \`ERROR\` is presumably a constant or enum variant indicating that the node represents a syntax error. # Summary This function is designed for syntax error recovery in a parser or compiler. When it encounters syntax errors, it decides based on the current and expected tokens (from \`recovery\` TokenSet) whether to immediately log an error and return, or attempt to recover by logging the error, advancing the parser to skip the problematic token, and marking this section of code as erroneous before attempting to continue parsing. This approach helps prevent cascading errors that can obscure the root cause of the initial syntax mistake."},{"instruction":"what will be significant block boundaries for python lang based on similar to this code \`\`\`if matches!(self.current(), T![‘{’] | T![‘}’]) { self.error(message); return; } This block checks if the current token is either { or }. If so, it logs/writes the error using self.error(message) and returns early. This means these tokens are considered as points where error recovery should not proceed further, likely because they represent significant block boundaries in the language being parsed.\`\`\`","output":"In Python, the language does not use curly braces \`{}\` to denote block boundaries as languages like C, C++, Java, or Rust do. Instead, Python uses indentation to define blocks. However, certain tokens can still be considered significant boundaries or markers for specific structures within the language. For an error recovery mechanism in a Python parser similar to the provided Rust code, the following tokens might serve as such significant points: 1. **Indentation and Dedentation Tokens:** Python's lexer typically converts indentation changes into \`INDENT\` and \`DEDENT\` tokens. These tokens represent the increase or decrease in indentation level that, in turn, denotes block boundaries. 2. **Colon (\`:\`):** The colon is used in Python to signify the start of a block. For structures such as \`if\`, \`for\`, \`while\`, function definitions with \`def\`, and class definitions with \`class\`, a colon precedes the block of code that belongs to that structure. 3. **Keywords like \`def\`, \`class\`, \`if\`, \`elif\`, \`else\`, \`try\`, \`except\`, \`finally\`, \`for\`, \`while\`:** These introduce blocks or significant structural elements in the code, and hence encountering them can signify either potential recovery points or places where certain assumptions must be revisited in the face of an error. Translating the concept from the provided Rust code to a Python context, an equivalent check might look for these tokens rather than \`{\` and \`}\`. The logic could be repurposed to say: \`\`\`rust if matches!(self.current(), T![‘:’] | T![INDENT] | T![DEDENT] | KeywordStartOfBlockToken) { self.error(message); return; } \`\`\` This is a conceptual adaptation to Python's syntax requirements where block beginnings and ends are inferred from indentation and specific syntax markers (\`:\`) rather than explicit braces. The adapted code isn't directly applicable since \`INDENT\`, \`DEDENT\`, and \`KeywordStartOfBlockToken\` are placeholders for whatever actual token representations are used in the specific parser implementation for Python. This example illustrates the practice of employing early return upon encountering tokens that signal significant structure demarcations in the parsed language, adjusting for Python's unique syntax rules."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a jockey having a friendly race with someone in a muscle car.

Here's a basic approach using the \`sys\` and \`os\` modules, which should work on most platforms: \`\`\`python import os import sys def restart_program(): \\"\\"\\"Restarts the current program, with file objects and descriptors cleanup \\"\\"\\" try: # This is for Windows systems if sys.platform == \\"win32\\": os.system(f'start /B {sys.executable} {\\" \\".join(sys.argv)}') else: # This is for Unix/Linux/MacOS systems os.execv(sys.executable, [sys.executable] + sys.argv) except Exception as e: # If the attempt to restart fails, you can fallback to this method print(f\\"Failed to restart: {e}\\") os.system(f'python {\\" \\".join(sys.argv)}') # Example use if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": # Your code here print(\\"Program is restarting...\\") restart_program() \`\`\` This example defines a function \`restart_program()\` that you can call from anywhere in your script to restart it. Note that there are some caveats: 1. **Command Line Arguments**: This method preserves command-line arguments passed to the script. If your script takes input parameters, they will be passed again on restart. 2. **Environment**: The restarted program will inherit the current program's environment. If you've made changes to the environment that affect your program, those changes will persist. 3. **Windows Specifics**: On Windows, using \`os.system('start ...')\` opens a new command prompt by default. This may not be desirable. Consider using the \`subprocess\` module with \`Popen\` for more control. 4. **Error Handling**: There's a basic \`try-except\` block in the example. Depending on your needs, you might want to expand this to handle specific failure cases more gracefully or log errors. 5. **Resource Cleanup**: Make sure any necessary cleanup (like closing file handles, network connections, etc.) is done before calling the restart function, as this method won't do it for you. 6. **Security Considerations**: Be aware of the security implications of restarting scripts, especially if they use or handle sensitive data. Ensure that command-line arguments or environment variables do not inadvertently expose sensitive information. 7. **\`execv\` Method**: In Unix-like systems, \`os.execv\` is more efficient as it replaces the current process with the new one, while the \`os.system()\` method launches the script as a separate process."},{"instruction":"with this approach the privious object and memory used by previous runed instance of .py file whould be releases or would be remain ?","output":"When you restart a Python script from within itself using methods like \`os.execv\` on Unix-like systems or analogous methods on Windows, the operating system replaces the current process with a new instance of the program. This process effectively releases the memory used by the previous instance and starts fresh with the new instance. Here's how memory management works with these approaches: 1. **\`os.execv\` and Similar Methods:** - On Unix-like systems, when you use \`os.execv\` and similar functions (\`execve\`, \`execl\`, etc.), the current process image is replaced with a new process image. This means the operating system releases the memory and resources used by the current process and allocates what's needed for the new instance. The process identifier (PID) remains the same. This approach is efficient in terms of memory usage since it doesn't start a second process but replaces the current one. - This mechanism ensures that the previous objects and memory allocations of the script are cleaned up, as the entire process is replaced by a new process executing the script from the start. 2. **\`os.system\` or Opening a New Process:** - When using \`os.system\` or a similar method that effectively starts a new process (such as opening a new command prompt window on Windows with \`start\`), you're creating a new instance of the Python interpreter as a separate process. In this case, the original script's process will continue to exist until it exits naturally (for example, after calling \`os.system\`), at which point the operating system cleans up its used memory and resources. - In this scenario, there will be a brief period where the memory footprint is larger, as both the original and the new instances exist simultaneously. However, once the original script terminates, its resources will be released. To ensure a smooth restart and cleanup, it's recommended to: - Perform any necessary cleanup tasks in your script before triggering a restart (e.g., closing open files, network connections, saving data). This is particularly important because abrupt restarts might skip cleanup code unless it's explicitly called before the restart logic. - Understand the behavior of the restart mechanism you're using (e.g., \`os.execv\` vs. \`os.system\`) regarding process management and resource cleanup. To summarize, using \`os.execv\` for restarting ensures that the previous objects and memory used by the instance are released, as this approach replaces the current process image. When starting a new process (like with \`os.system\` in a way that doesn't immediately exit the original process), resources will be released after the original process completes its execution and exits."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a jockey having a friendly race with someone in a muscle car. His name is Arthur. Arthur has slicked back blonde hair and blue eyes. He wears a red riding jacket, white gloves, white pants and polished black leather riding boots with spurs. He is posh, tender and playful. He has a British accent. He is 20. That muscle car is a green Pontiac firebird with a white Allied star and it's nicknamed General Sherman. The race ends in a draw.","output":"INT. RACE TRACK – SUNSET The sun is setting, casting a beautiful golden hue over the race track. On one side of the track stands ARTHUR, a 20-year-old jockey, with slicked-back blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. He's adorned in a bold red riding jacket, contrasted with white gloves, white pants, and polished black leather riding boots with spurs, exuding an air of elegance and competitiveness. His posture is relaxed yet confident, a gentle smile playing on his lips. Next to him is his majestic horse, a stunning chestnut with a fiery streak in its eyes, mirroring Arthur’s own spirit. On the other end, revving its engine, is General Sherman, a vibrant green Pontiac Firebird with a white Allied star painted on its hood. It’s more than just a muscle car; it's an embodiment of raw power and speed, its engine roaring like a beast eager to break free. CUT TO: EXT. RACE TRACK – CONTINUOUS Arthur’s opponent, a rugged, charismatic driver in racing gear, gives him a nod from inside General Sherman. Despite the tension of the upcoming race, there's a palpable mutual respect between the two competitors. ARTHUR (cheerfully, with a British accent) May the best man win, although I must say, Sherman there does seem a bit overfed for this race, don’t you think? The driver laughs, revving General Sherman’s engine in response, the sound thunderous against the serene sunset. DRIVER We’ll just have to see if horsepower beats actual horse power today, won’t we? Arthur mounts his horse gracefully, patting its neck affectionately, a playful glint in his eye. ARTHUR (to his horse) Let’s show them what we’re made of, old chap. The tension builds as both competitors line up at the start line, the suspense palpable in the air. A flag is raised, and with a swift motion, it’s brought down. They’re off! Arthur and his horse burst forward with astonishing speed, the horse's hooves thundering against the track. Meanwhile, General Sherman shoots forward with a ferocious roar, its tires screeching as it gains momentum. It’s a spectacular sight; muscle vs. muscle, machine vs. nature, each holding their own, side by side. Arthur and the driver exchange playful glances, pushing their respective steeds to the limit. The race track winds and twists, but both competitors navigate it with impressive skill and agility. Arthur leans into his horse, whispering words of encouragement. The bond between them is unmistakable, their movements in perfect harmony. As they approach the finish line, it’s impossible to tell who's in the lead. The horse and General Sherman cross the line simultaneously, the race ending in a draw. The crowd erupts in cheers and applause, but the most triumphant sounds are the hearty laughter between Arthur and the driver as they come to a stop, acknowledging each other’s prowess. ARTHUR (extending his hand, still playful) Well fought, my friend! It seems we’re evenly matched. DRIVER (shaking Arthur’s hand) Indeed, it was an honor racing against you…and your magnificent steed. Shall we call it a tie? As they chat and laugh, the sun dips below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the scene. There’s a sense of camaraderie and respect, a moment frozen in time where it wasn’t about winning or losing, but about the sheer joy of the race.

{coupon_id,time,days,platform,payway,bank,card_type,area,shops,bins,coupons,daily,weekly,monthly,total,scene,state} 一些预设： 三明，即三明市 沙县，即三明市沙县 仅仅提及“付款码”，则属于被扫 仅仅提及“扫码”或“扫一扫”，则属于主扫 提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。 情况2：如间隔连续的时间范围，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"2024-4-1 ~ 2024-4-5 每天10点~18点，2024-4-10 ~ 2024-4-15 每天10点~18点\\"； 情况2例子：2024年4月10日至2024年5月10日，2024年5月10日至2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。 情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求: 根据time算出活动结束时间，与“当前时间”进行比较判断，如果当前时间大于等于活动结束时间，则为值2，当前时间小于活动结束时间，则值为1，无法判断则值为0，默认值为0 关于支付场景scene包括: 1、生活缴费(如：话费、水费、煤气费、电费) 2、影票 3、信用卡还款 4、餐饮美食 5、罚没 6、充电(如汽车充电) 7、机票 8、车票 9、船票 10、酒店住宿 11、租车 12、门票 13、购车

情况1，如只提到了活动周期内总限n次，则令daily=0，weekly=0，monthly=0，total=n； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=0，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=0，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 14:12:13

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求:

情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 13:34:19

These were partly directed at the luxurious life of the officers, partly at the influence of ‘money' in the army, partly again at the lack of enthusiasm for service. From 1757 to 1760, i.e. during the Seven Years War, some 1,500 officers had asked to resign and been permitted to do so. In the three decades that followed the war, additional and improved training facilities were established, the company economy was abolished along with the purchase of officer commissions, the influence of the ministry on promotions was extended and the re-purchase of commissions by the crown introduced. (At the outbreak of the Revolution, a large proportion of commissions were now the property of the crown.) Schools were also intro-duced for the sons of other ranks, and orphanages established for the children of fallen soldiers. Efforts were also made to improve arrangements for the treatment of wounded. These reforms went together with strategies designed to defend the pre-eminence of the old nobility in the army. In actual fact the nobility succeeded in 'confiscating' the reform, as Corvisier puts it.97 Many were ready to make a sacrifice in order to achieve this goal. They accepted the requirement of training, the abolition of the company economy with the loss of what were often substantial income opportunities, and the abolition of the practice of convocation; they ultimately accepted even the command to wear uniform. Certain competitive advantages of the nobility were ended in this way. Official strategies of exclusion were insistently demanded, however, and with increasing success, against all the recently ennobled who despite the massive social discrimination strategies of the officer corps could not be prevented from striving for an officer career. Besides the claims of the nobility for access to training establishments, instructions were already given to the army inspectors in 1758 only to propose candidates for officer appointments who could prove their nobility. The reform of the training system sharpened the demands for proof of nobility. In the 1770s, this was even extended to the artillery schools. The nobility thereby claimed supremacy over a military field that, for two hundred years, had been seen as less socially exclusive. In the royal guards regiments, officer candidates had to prove from 1774 that their family had been noble for two hundred years, a period that was soon after extended to three hundred years. The royal decree of 1781, known as the decree of Ségur, thus only regularised a practice that had already been implemented in the previous decades. All that was new in the decree was that the required evidence of nobility was now formalised (birth announcements, documents from the tax authorities, letters patents, etc.), in such a way that anyone who tried to present their noble status as older than it actually was, was deprived of the pleasure of deceit. In a certain respect, the dissolution of the compagnies des gendarmes d'ordonnance in 1788 marked the apogee of these strategies to ensure the privi-lege of the old nobility in the army. It corresponded to the need for a reduction in costs. Whereas the gardes du corps, in which the high nobility dominated, were unaffected, the gendarmerie, in which there were also non-noble officers, and where, according to J.G. Devos and P. Waksman,98 a service ethic inde-pendent of estate had developed, fell victim to these economy measures. The strategies of the nobility were in general successful in their attempt to keep the army as a noble institution. Yet those who had most vigorously pursued them, members of the poorer noblesse d'épée, profited from this success only to a limited degree. For what eventually emerged was a relatively exact convergence between estate hierarchy and military rank. Despite the establishment of stipends in the cadet schools, and the official abolition of the purchase of officer commissions, the military career for sons of the poorer nobility culminated in the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Higher ranks remained reserved for the court nobility. If the army of the 1770s and 80s still contained a few ennobled and bourgeois officers, these are estimated at no more than 1 to 2 per cent. Their career ended with the rank of lieutenant. After the military reforms of the 1760s, candidates to a junior officer position had to provide that they could read and write. This excluded competitors from the common people almost entirely. Scarcely anyone who did not hail from the well-off bourgeoisie reached a rank above that of corporal. As Corvisier points out, a virtual ‘second front' of exclusion practices arose in this way. Whilst the rank of lieutenant was the upper limit for roturiers, promotion for sons of the poorer strata of the population ended at the most junior officer ranks (corporals did not count as junior officers). This explains why the Revolution very rapidly constructed a new convergence between social and military hierarchy. The better-off social strata provided the officers, the people provided the soldiers. The army always stood in the foreground of the French crown's fighting forces, in terms of military policy as well as financially and socially. It remained so even as the sites of power politics shifted, with ‘England' now replacing 'Austria' as the main enemy of 'France', and overseas strategies of trade and colonial policy gaining new importance. To a certain degree, how-ever, the conditions of generalised rule under the ancien régime are shown particularly clearly in the case of the navy. For as this was only really founded in the second half of the seventeenth century (at the end of the Thirty Years War, the crown possessed scarcely more than a handful of seaworthy ships), its development was not prevented by centuries-old traditions and long- established material interests. Colbert, who was controller-general of finances under Louis XIV, made sure that the navy did not become the plaything of competition for privilege. Both naval officers and the naval administration were selected according to competence, and the best specialists obtained for the arsenals. Given the development of naval artillery and the altered require-ments of shipbuilding and navigation that this led to, such an orientation to specialist expertise would seem quite unavoidable. Its most important expres-sion was the fact that positions of command in the French navy could not be purchased, nor could administrative positions (the officiers de la plume). But the navy could not be organised as a kind of social enclave. Patronage ensured that the higher ranks of naval officer were generally occupied by nobles, while bourgeois could only reach the rank of warrant officer and gain certain administrative positions. (The constant conflict between naval commanders and bourgeois officiers de la plume became one of the causes for the ineffectiveness of the French navy, once it was no longer under the strict con-trol of Colbert.) When the crown began its immense shipbuilding programme, it was not hard to find officer candidates. In 1689, the French naval strength was over 120 vessels.99 Not only was this twenty more than the English crown had at its disposal at that time, but these were ships built according to up-to-date experience of the most favourable combination of striking force, speed and manoeuvrability. This technical advantage of the French navy over the English lasted until the end of the ancien régime. Yet it did not lead to a military superiority on sea, as the navy was drastically cut back after the War of the Spanish Succession (by 1739 it was down to 50 ships, while the English strength had risen to 124). The structural inefficiency of the eighteenthcentury French navy had two other important causes, which could not be overcome by the tremendous reconstruction programme that was begun in the 1750s (by 1756 its strength was back up to 70). The first of these resulted from a government disinterest that had persisted for decades. Promotions were effected almost without any heed paid to ability, training of new recruits was neglected, and friction between administration and ship's commanders was a constant problem. In the last instance, the officers of the fleet were an undisciplined bunch. The second structural problem of the French navy was the difficulty of manning. Even the great efforts made in Colbert's time could not solve this. To ensure adequate manning of the galleys, which at that time were still organised separately, courts were requested to sentence more pris-oners to this punishment. It was also hoped that volunteers could be found for the navy, but this was in vain. The adequate manning of warships was not only threatened by natural disadvantage but also by military conflicts, since trading ships were seized by foreign corsairs, or else commandeered by their owners for temporary pirate expeditions if they received lettres de marques from the crown; wages in the merchant navy were also higher as a rule than on the king's ships. The government then resorted to press gangs, but the results of this recruitment practice were disastrous both on sea and on land. To appease the discontent of the population and help root out unsuitable personnel, a so-called system of classes was introduced in 1689. All ablebodied seamen between 18 and 60 had to be registered - more precisely, the male population of the coastal districts. They were grouped into classes, and their working life was supposed to be divided between three-year terms in the navy interspersed with half-pay periods on land.100 To implement this service obligation, a special judiciary was appointed. The whole arrangement, however, was immediately blocked, not only by those who potentially were directly affected, but also by local officials. Even the crown's request to priests to preach the duty of royal service did little to help matters. The service obligation was evaded by flight, and the local authorities refused to prosecute the offenders. As for those who were successfully recruited, they frequently rose up in mass mutinies. Many deserters hired themselves on French or foreign merchant ships. The view was long widespread among historians that the reason for the lack of trained seamen in the French navy lay in the competition with the prospects offered on merchant ships and corsairs. In his detailed study of the French navy in the age of Louis XIV, James Pritchard has refuted this argument quite decisively. Over the decades, he found, many men in France did serve on naval ships for shorter or longer periods, not only those recruited through the system of classes, but also volunteers from inland districts. When the alternation arrangement was abolished at the start of the eighteenth century, life-long service engagement became possible and more common. The principle of half-pay was then established as a provision for old age and a support for the injured and crippled. As early as 1689, seamen in the French navy were given certain privileges, such as exemption from the billeting of soldiers, from tax collection and local guard service, even if, right from the start, these privileges were very often infringed. But all this, so Pritchard finds, did not impede manning so long as wages were more or less regularly paid. The ineffectiveness of the navy in his view was above all the result of the system of financial management. This was in the possession of private financiers, who provided the crown with short-term credits and earned immense sums in a pretty regular way. A short time after the start of the Seven Years War, the payment of wages stopped and suppliers' bills were not settled. Sailors could now only be found if five months' wages were paid in advance, instead of the previous two months'. Even so, the number of deserters rose so greatly that the death penalty for desertion had to be de facto suspended. Returned or captured deserters were punished only with deduction from their pay - which they might well not receive anyway. War at sea was financed almost entirely on the basis of forced loans that the crown imposed on suppliers and the ships' companies. Even later on, these debts were not settled. In such circumstances, it was not surprising - in Pritchard's view - that many ships had to be destroyed or surrendered to the enemy. In 1758, it is estimated that at least 20,000 seamen were in English captivity, rising to 26,000 in 1762. This was despite the fact that many thousand prisoners annually fell victim to the spread of infection.”翻译为中文","output":"在1757年罗斯巴赫战役中法国军队遭受了毁灭性的失败后，对根本性改革的需求变得广泛。这些需求部分针对官员的奢侈生活，部分针对军队中“金钱”的影响，再部分针对对服役的热情缺乏。从1757年到1760年，即在七年战争期间，约有1,500名官员申请辞职并被允许这样做。在战争结束后的三十年里，建立了额外的和改进的训练设施，取消了连队经济和购买军官职位，扩大了部长对晋升的影响，并引入了军官职位的回购制度（在革命爆发时，大部分职位现在已是王室所有）。还为其他军衔的儿子引入了学校，并为阵亡士兵的子女建立了孤儿院。还致力于改善对伤员的处理安排。这些改革伴随着旨在保护旧贵族在军队中的优越地位的策略。实际上，贵族成功地“没收”了改革，正如Corvisier所说。许多人准备为实现这一目标而做出牺牲。他们接受了训练的要求，取消了连队经济以及往往是大量收入机会的损失，取消了召集的做法；他们最终甚至接受了穿制服的命令。这样一来，贵族的某些竞争优势就结束了。然而，官方的排斥策略却被迫地并且越来越成功地针对所有最近被封爵的人提出，尽管面对军官团队的大量社会歧视策略，这些人无法被阻止追求军官职业。除了贵族对训练机构的访问要求外，1758年已经指示军队检查员只提名能证明其贵族身份的军官候选人。训练体系的改革加剧了对贵族身份证明的要求。到了1770年代，这种要求甚至扩展到了炮兵学校。贵族由此在长达两百年被视为较少社会排他的军事领域中声索了至高无上的地位。在皇家卫队团中，军官候选人从1774年起必须证明其家族已有两百年的贵族身份，这一期限不久之后延长到三百年。1781年的皇家法令，即所谓的塞古尔法令，只是将先前几十年已经实施的做法正式化。新颖之处在于，所需的贵族身份证明现在被正式化（出生公告、税务局文件、专利信等），以这样一种方式，任何试图将其贵族地位呈现得比实际更久远的人，都被剥夺了欺骗的乐趣。 从某种意义上说，1788年解散诺曼底骑士团达到了这些策略的顶峰，以确保旧贵族在军队中的特权。这对应于削减成本的需求。虽然高贵族占主导地位的卫队未受影响，但骑警队因包括非贵族官员在内，并且根据J.G. Devos和P. Waksman所说，那里发展了一种独立于地位的服务伦理，成为了这些经济措施的牺牲品。 总的来说，贵族在保持军队为贵族机构的尝试中是成功的。然而，那些最积极追求这些目标的人，即较贫穷的剑贵族成员，只在有限的程度上从这一成功中获益。因为最终形成了财产等级和军衔之间相对精确的对应关系。尽管在军校设立了奖学金，并且正式废除了购买军官职位，但贫穷贵族的子弟的军事生涯最高只能达到中校军衔。更高的军衔被预留给宫廷贵族。如果说1770年代和80年代的军队中仍有一些爵位和资产阶级军官，他们的比例估计不超过1到2％。他们的职业生涯以中尉军衔结束。在1760年代的军事改革之后，想要成为初级军官的候选人必须提供他们能读能写的证明。这几乎完全排除了普通人的竞争。几乎没有来自富裕资产阶级的人能达到上尉以上的军衔。正如Corvisier所指出的，这样一来产生了一种几乎是“第二战线”的排外做法。虽然中尉是平民可达到的最高军衔，但对于较贫穷阶层的子弟来说，晋升停留在最初级的军官军衔（下士不被视为初级军官）。这就解释了为什么革命很快就在社会和军事层面之间构建了新的对应关系。较富裕的社会阶层提供了军官，民众提供了士兵。 军队始终是法兰西王冠战斗力量的前沿，无论是在军事政策上还是在财政和社会上。即使权力政治的场所发生了变化，以“英国”现在取代“奥地利”成为“法国”的主要敌人，海外贸易和殖民政策的战略也获得了新的重要性，情况仍然如此。然而，在一定程度上，海军建设的情况特别清楚地展示了旧制度下普遍统治的条件。因为海军实际上是在十七世纪下半叶（三十年战争结束时，王冠几乎只拥有少数几艘航海船只）才真正建立的，它的发展并未受到几百年来的传统和早已建立的物质利益的阻碍。路易十四时代的财政总管科尔贝特确保海军不成为特权竞争的玩物。海军官员和海军管理层根据能力选拔，为船坞获取了最佳专家。鉴于海军炮兵的发展和船舶建造及导航要求的变化，这种专业专长的导向似乎是不可避免的。其最重要的表现是，法国海军的指挥职位不能购买，行政职位（笔官员）也是如此。但海军不能被组织成一种社会飞地。通过赞助确保了海军高级军官职位通常由贵族占据，而资产阶级只能达到军械官的军衔并获得某些行政职位。（海军指挥官与资产阶级笔官员之间的持续冲突成为了法国海军效率低下的原因之一，一旦不再受到科尔贝特的严格控制。） 当王室开始其庞大的造船计划时，寻找军官候选人并不困难。到1689年，法国的海军力量超过了120艘船。不仅比当时英国王室拥有的船只多出二十艘，而且这些船是根据最新经验建造的，结合了打击力、速度和机动性的最佳组合。法国海军对英国的技术优势持续到了旧制度的末期。然而，它并未转化为海上的军事优势，因为在西班牙继承战争后海军大幅削减（到了1739年减少到50艘，而英国的实力上升到了124艘）。十八世纪法国海军的结构性低效还有其他两个重要原因，这两个问题不能被1750年代开始的巨大重建计划（到了1756年其实力回升到了70艘）所克服。第一个原因源于政府几十年来持续的不关心。晋升几乎不考虑能力，忽视了新兵的训练，行政与舰队指挥官之间的摩擦是一个持续的问题。最终，舰队的军官是一群无纪律的人。法国海军的第二个结构性问题是征兵的困难。即使科尔贝特时期所做的巨大努力也无法解决这个问题。为了确保充足的人手操作桨帆船（当时仍然是分开组织的），法院被要求判处更多的囚犯接受这一惩罚。还希望能为海军找到志愿者，但这是徒劳的。战舰的充足人手不仅受到自然劣势的威胁，还受到军事冲突的影响，因为商船被外国私掠船夺走，或者被船主们为临时的海盗行动征用，如果他们从王室获得了私掠许可证；商船上的工资也通常比国王的船只高。政府随后诉诸于征兵，但这种征募做法在海上和陆上都是灾难性的。为了平息人民的不满并帮助淘汰不适任的人员，1689年引入了所谓的等级制度。所有18至60岁的健康水手都必须登记 - 更准确地说，是沿海地区的男性人口。他们被分成不同的类别，其工作生涯应在海军服役的三年期和陆上的半薪期之间交替。为了实施这一服役义务，指派了一套特殊的司法系统。然而，整个安排立即被那些直接受影响的人以及地方官员所阻挠。即使王室请求牧师宣讲皇家服役的义务，也对解决问题没有什么帮助。通过逃跑来逃避服役义务，当地当局拒绝追捕这些逃犯。至于那些成功被征募的人，他们经常集体发生叛乱。许多逃兵在法国或外国的商船上找到工作。历史学家们长期普遍认为，法国海军缺乏训练有素的水手的原因在于与商船和私掠船所提供的前景的竞争。James Pritchard在其关于路易十四时代的法国海军建设的详细研究中彻底推翻了这一论点。他发现，几十年来，许多法国男性确实在海军船只上服役过较短或较长的时间，不仅是通过等级制度招募的人员，还包括来自内陆区域的志愿者。当十八世纪初取消了轮换安排时，终身服役变得可能且更为常见。随后为老年人建立了半薪原则，为伤残者提供支持。早在1689年，法国海军的水手就被赋予了一定的特权，如免除驻军、征税和地方警卫服务的义务，即使这些特权从一开始就经常被侵犯。但所有这些，Pritchard发现，只要工资或多或少地定期支付，就不会妨碍人手充足。他认为，海军效率低下主要是由财政管理体系造成的。这一体系掌握在私人金融家手中，他们为王室提供短期信贷，并以相当规律的方式赚取巨额资金。七年战争开始后不久，工资支付就停止了，供应商的账单也未得到结算。现在只有提前支付五个月的工资，而不是之前的两个月，才能找到水手。即便如此，逃兵的数量还是大幅增加，以至于不得不实际上取消了对逃兵的死刑处罚。被追回或俘获的逃兵只受到从工资中扣除的惩罚 - 他们可能根本就不会得到这笔钱。海上战争几乎完全是基于王室对供应商和船只公司强制贷款的基础上进行的。即使在以后，这些债务也没有得到解决。在这种情况下，Pritchard认为，许多船只被摧毁或投降给敌人并不奇怪。据估计，1758年至少有20,000名水手被英国俘获，到1762年这个数字上升到26,000。尽管每年有成千上万的囚犯死于传染病。"},{"instruction":"请将“When the Seven Years War came to an end, reforms were demanded not just in the army but also in the navy. According to Pritchard, naval reform rarely progressed beyond mere intention (a fact that was long overlooked, since the supposed reality of reforms was based on the decrees of Choiseul). The decisive factor here was not so much that there was still no unity of command (though the incorporation of the galleys into the navy was effected) and that the connection with the knights of Malta, who had their own agenda, could not be dissolved, but rather that the navy remained an institution whose development and readiness was dependent on profit interests. Fiscal power In an essay on ‘Financial Science and Sociology' first published in 1917, Rudolf Goldscheid proposed that 'financial history supplies not only the way into state history, but also into the study of state structure and function'.101 The example of the French ancien régime shows this analytical proposal as even more promising than its proposer supposed. For whilst Goldscheid derived the development of the system of finance from a 'common financial need',102 i.e. functions of the state that had a basis in society, for ancien-régime 'states' the development of the financial system is actually a constituting moment in the development of social structures. Nowhere is this more evident than in France. Not only were struggles for the possession and exercise of rule in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries quite overwhelmingly struggles over the conditions of generalised appropriation. The possession of specific tax privileges was seen as the decisive determination of social status, and the profits that could be drawn in one way or another from the royal fiscal power contributed considerably to the material reproduction of the ruling estates. Lastly, the crown's financial 'administration' was also a regular structural fac-tor in the contemporary system of employment. In the first half of the seven-teenth century the crown employed at least 75,000 people in the collection of direct taxes alone. If we include the peasants who had the obligation of collect-ing local taxes, at least for temporary periods, then this number is increased by a further 80,000 to 100,000. That would be a total of between 2 and 3 per cent of the male population.103 The most important structural feature in the financial system of the French crown can be summed up very simply: it was not a means to an end, in the sense that Goldscheid had in mind (i.e. for functions of the state), but largely a purpose unto itself. To put it in modern terms, the financial 'administration' was not the precondition for state-organised redistribution, it was a system of private appropriation in its own right. 'Domestic government' meant the control of private participation in the royal fiscal power in such a way that not only the fiscal preconditions for external power politics, but also the political ones, could be fulfilled and maintained. Any interpretative model that studies the tax 'administration' of the ancien régime only in respect to its directly fiscal yield, and thus works within an analytical framework of administrative efficiency, is inappropriate to its object of investigation. Worse still: this erroneous interpretation of the financial system obstructs access to analysis of the operational and crisis conditions of generalised rule under the ancien régime. The financial system served to finance the court and the king's wars, to meet the costs of diplomatic manoeuvres abroad, and to purchase loyalty at home. To this extent it was a means to specific ends. At the same time, however, it was also an organisation for material participation in the centralised fiscal power. Some forms of this participation were stigmatised as corruption, even under the ancien régime. But the structure of the financial system meant that the dividing line between permitted and 'corrupt' practices of appropriation was not defined legally, but only ever in political terms. If we start by examining the regular forms of benefit from the power of taxation and the state debt, the first of these was nomination to financial office. With the introduction of the paulette, this meant the acquisition of an inheritable property that yielded a rent in the form of a salary. In the 1620s and 30s the crown sold many new financial offices, this being one of the most rapid ways of getting money. All the more so, in that aspiring purchasers and office-holders could be forced to make loans to the state. These forced loans were sometimes repaid, but by no means always, and could be written off by a policy of state bankruptcy. By machinations of this kind, the organisation of tax administration was itself transformed into a form of tax.104 This could be a reason why the profits from office fell, though offices remained attractive to many people as an access to noble status. The devaluation of offices by their multiplication, and by the introduction of new administrative structures, was one of the reasons for the office-holders' Fronde. To convert their ill-will into action, it only needed, after several increases in the tax on inheritance (the paulette), the announcement in 1748 that the paulette would be completely abolished. From 1716, many financial 'officials' were not only owners of their office and thus possessors of claims to rents and a power position giving them access to forms of income that in France of the ancien régime were described as pot- de-vin (acknowledgement for services in the form of presents, patronage and other favours), they were also owners of a right to the tax that they collected. From this time on, the crown sold rights of this kind, and continued to sell right after right. The practice was introduced because of a short-term need for money, whereas the collection of tax regularly took too long in relation to the crown's pressing requirements. The increase in direct taxation that led to uprisings in many places in the 1620s and 30s did not mean any increase in the sums reaching the crown, as it simply involved the surcharge of droits on the previous sum. In many districts, it became impossible to collect direct taxes in the 1630s, when the costs of billeting had to be added to the costs of collection. The far-reaching breakdown of the tax ‘administration', and the ‘collection' of taxes by the military that was then required, was by no means the least important factor in leading the crown to reduce the permitted share and increase its own share of the tax take. Tax refusal was widespread at this time, but above all there was the refusal of local tax officials (in which connection it is uncertain whether these did not continue to collect sums for their ‘rights' even if no taxes could supposedly be collected). The alternative of tax terror was not very effective. The dragonades, i.e. the deployment of dragoons in ‘administering' tax, often produced so much destruction that villages in which dragoons were billeted could not be taxed again for a good while to come. Eventually the crown abandoned the attempt to devalue or abolish the rights that it had itself offered for sale. This practice only came to an end in the eighteenth century. The coincidence in time with the introduction of taxation on the nobility led Collins105 to the supposition that the vingtième and capitation were alternatives to obtaining funds by the sale of tax shares. A further form of private enrichment from the royal fiscal power was tax farming. We have already explained how one reason why the crown made use of this form of collection was to rule out legal proceedings against its own administration. It was indirect taxes in particular that were leased out, the most important of these being the tax on salt or gabelle. Previously used only in particular cases, the practice of tax farming became more general in the course of the sixteenth century. At first private individuals leased the collection of a particular tax in a particular district from the élus, the tax officials responsible for an élection. Under Colbert the concentration of the farming system was taken further. In 1726, finally, the ferme générale was intro-duced, a kind of syndicate. The principle of economic operation was scarcely changed. The tax farmers were commissioned to collect indirect taxes, and could deduct from the sums extracted a contractually established share - as compensation for their expenses and as profit. The farmers in turn, whether they were individuals or companies, sub-leased shares in the tax farm to a large number of private operators, known in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as croupiers or sometimes partisans. Some of these croupiers were 'active', i.e. assistants and employees of the tax farmers, but most were a kind of shareholder in the private profit drawn from the tax authority of the French crown. These last, who participated only economically, included artisans and small traders, well-to-do bourgeois, but especially a large number of nobles. They even included both Louis XIV, who endowed his mistresses from this source of profit,106 and Louis XV.107 Tax farmers drew their main profit not from their actual share in the tax take, but rather from the advances that they paid the crown on future tax collection. These advances attracted interest, at an average rate of 15 per cent. In the 1620s, when the crown implemented the forcible unification of the kingdom by depriving the Huguenots of their former military privileges, and at the same time made substantial payments to allies in the Thirty Years War, the interest rate rose to 30 per cent.108 It is no wonder that many people were ready to invest in participation in the tax farm. In the years of the Fronde, when a large number of office-holders and nobles rebelled against the crown, many of the noble leaders also held papers entitling them to a profit from the expenses that their rebellion cost the crown. The tax farm was thus a kind of joint stock company and credit institution. Its role in this last capacity was confirmed when the project of a state bank failed in 1716-20, not least due to the resistance of the tax farmers and other state creditors. From 1726, the ferme générale was a fixed institution, with leases limited to a few years at a time but with its own offices and buildings, and even a staff who were mainly employed on a permanent basis. Between 1726 and 1740 alone, the ferme générale is thought to have made a profit of 60 million livres, not including interest.109 The tax farmers were a specially privileged social group. Though not employees of the crown, they were in its commission, and were entitled just like senior 'officials' to carry a sword. They were exempt from military service and city guard duties, from the billeting of soldiers and various other burdens imposed on members of the Third Estate, and they could only be accused before the cour des aides in Paris. These privileges were supposedly granted only to farmers concluding contracts, but were extended in practice to all participants.”翻译为中文","output":"当七年战争结束时，人们不仅对军队，也对海军提出了改革要求。据普里查德（Pritchard）所述，海军改革很少超出意图阶段（这一事实长期被忽视，因为所谓改革的现实基于肖瓦塞尔的法令）。这里的决定性因素不仅仅是因为仍然没有统一指挥（尽管把桨帆船纳入海军的行动已经实施），也不仅是因为与有着自己议程的马耳他骑士团的联系无法解除，而更是因为海军仍然是一个其发展和准备状态取决于利益的机构。 财政力量 鲁道夫·戈尔德谢德（Rudolf Goldscheid）在1917年首次发表的《财政科学与社会学》一文中提出，“财政历史不仅提供了通向国家历史的途径，也通向了对国家结构和功能的研究”。法国旧制度的例子表明，这一分析提议比其提出者想象的还要有前景。因为尽管戈尔德谢德从“共同的财政需求”（即基于社会的国家功能）推导出了财政体系的发展，对于旧制度“国家”来说，财政体系的发展实际上是社会结构发展的构成时刻。法国尤其如此。十七和十八世纪为争夺统治权的斗争绝大多数是围绕普遍性征用条件的争夺。特定的税务特权的拥有被视为社会地位的决定性因素，而从王室财政力量中以各种方式提取的利润，极大地贡献于统治阶层的物质再生产。最后，王室的财政“管理”也是当代就业系统的常规结构因素。在十七世纪上半叶，仅直接税的征收就雇用了至少75,000人。如果我们包括至少临时有责任收集地方税的农民，那么这个数字将增加80,000至100,000。这将占男性人口的2到3百分比。 法国王室财政体系中最重要的结构特征可以很简单地概括：它不是一种手段，就像戈尔德谢德心中想的那样（即用于国家的功能），而主要是一种目的本身。用现代术语来说，财政“管理”不是国家组织再分配的前提条件，它本身就是一种私人征用的系统。“内部治理”意味着以这样一种方式控制对王室财政力量的私人参与，不仅财政上的外交权力政治的前提条件可以得到满足和维护，政治上的也可以。任何仅就其直接财政收益研究旧制度的税务“管理”的解释模型，并因此在行政效率的分析框架内运作，都不适合其研究对象。更糟的是：这种对财政体系的误解解释阻碍了对旧制度下普遍统治的运作和危机条件的分析。 财政体系用于资助宫廷和国王的战争，支付国外外交策略的费用，并在国内购买忠诚。在这种程度上，它是达到特定目的的手段。同时，它也是一种对中央财政力量进行物质参与的组织。即使在旧制度下，某些参与形式也被视为腐败。但财政体系的结构意味着，允许和“腐败”的征用实践之间的界限不是法律定义的，而只能在政治上定义。如果我们首先审视来自税收权力和国家债务的常规利益形式，首先是财政职位的提名。引入保利税意味着获取了一种产生薪水形式租金的可继承财产。在1620和30年代，王室出售了许多新的财政职位，这是筹集资金最快的方式之一。尤其是因为有抱负的购买者和职位持有人可以被迫向国家提供贷款。这些强制贷款有时会被偿还，但并非总是如此，而且可以通过国家破产政策来抵消。通过这种手段，税务管理组织本身被转变为一种税收形式。这可能是职位利润下降的原因，尽管由于其通向贵族地位的通道，职位对许多人仍具有吸引力。通过增加新的行政结构，职位的贬值是职位持有者Fronde起义的原因之一。为了将他们的不满转化为行动，只需在几次增加继承税（保利税）之后，宣布1748年完全废除保利税。从1716年起，许多财政“官员”不仅是其职位的拥有者，因而是租金和一个能让他们获得在旧制度下法国被描述为好处费（以礼物、赞助和其他恩惠形式的服务认可）的收入形式的权力地位的拥有者，他们还拥有他们所征收的税收的权利。从这个时候起，王室出售了这样的权利，并继续出售权利接着权利。之所以引入这种做法，是因为短期的资金需求，而与王室紧迫的需求相比，税收的常规收集花费的时间过长。 1620和30年代许多地方爆发起义的直接税增加，并不意味着到达王室的金额增加，因为这仅涉及对先前金额的额外税收。在1630年代，当驻军费用必须加到收集费用上时，很多地区变得无法收取直接税。税务“管理”的大范围崩溃，以及随后需要军队来“收集”税款，绝不是导致王室减少允许的份额并增加自身份额的最不重要的因素。当时拒绝纳税非常普遍，但最重要的是地方税务官员的拒绝（在这一点上，尚不确定这些官员是否继续为他们的“权利”收取款项，即使据说无法收税）。税收恐怖的替代方案并不十分有效。龙骑兵用于“管理”税收的部署，往往造成如此多的破坏，以至于在龙骑兵驻扎的村庄很长一段时间内不能再征税。最终，王室放弃了贬值或废除自己出售的权利的尝试。这种做法直到18世纪才结束。与对贵族征税的引入同时的情况促使Collins认为，vingtième和capitation是通过出售税收份额筹集资金的替代方案。 从王室财政力量中获得私人财富的另一种形式是税务承包。我们已经解释了王室使用这种收集形式的原因之一是为了排除对其自身管理的法律诉讼。特别是间接税被出租出去，最重要的是盐税或gabelle。 税务承包的做法最初仅在特定情况下使用，但在十六世纪的过程中变得更为普遍。起初，私人从负责一个选举区的税务官员élus那里租下某个特定地区的特定税收的征收权。在柯尔贝尔（Colbert）的统治下，税务承包制度的集中化被进一步推进。最终在1726年，引入了ferme générale，一种类似财团的机构。经济运作原则几乎未变。税务承包商获委托收集间接税，并可以从提取的金额中扣除合同规定的份额 - 作为他们费用的补偿和利润。接着，无论是个人还是公司的农夫，都将税务承包中的份额二次出租给大量的私人经营者，这些人在十七和十八世纪被称为croupiers或有时partisans。其中一些croupiers是“活跃的”，即税务承包商的助手和雇员，但大多数是一种股东，他们从法国王室的税务权威中获取私人利润。这些仅在经济上参与的人包括手工艺人和小商人，富裕的资产阶级，但尤其是大量的贵族。甚至包括路易十四，他用这种利润来源资助他的情妇，以及路易十五。 税务承包商的主要利润不来自他们在税收中的实际份额，而是来自他们对未来税收收集支付给王室的预付款。这些预付款吸引了利息，平均利率为15%。在1620年代，当王室通过剥夺胡格诺派以前的军事特权来强行统一王国，并同时向三十年战争中的盟友支付巨额款项时，利率上升到了30％。难怪许多人愿意投资于税务承包中。在Fronde年间，当大量的官员和贵族反抗王室时，许多贵族领袖还持有让他们从其叛乱给王室造成的费用中获利的凭证。因此，税务承包商实际上是一种股份公司和信贷机构。当1716-20年国家银行的计划失败时，其在后一身份中的角色得到了确认，这不仅仅是由于税务承包商和其他国家债权人的抵抗。 从1726年起，ferme générale成为了一个固定的机构，租约每次限于几年，但拥有自己的办公室和建筑物，甚至主要是永久性雇员。仅在1726年至1740年间，ferme générale据认为获得了6000万里弗的利润，不包括利息。 税务承包商是一个特别享有特权的社会群体。尽管他们不是王室的雇员，但他们受其委托，并且有权像高级“官员”一样携带佩剑。他们免于服兵役和城市守卫职责，免于驻军和对第三等级成员强加的各种其他负担，并且他们只能在巴黎的cour des aides前被控告。这些特权理论上只授予签订合同的农夫，但实际上扩展到了所有参与者。"},{"instruction":"rotary_emb 和 position emb","output":"在处理自然语言处理(NLP)或某些类型的序列数据时，位置编码(Embedding)扮演了一个至关重要的角色，它帮助模型理解序列中不同元素的顺序关系。\\"rotary_emb\\"和\\"position emb\\"是两种实现位置编码的方法。 1. **Position Emb (位置嵌入)**： 位置嵌入（Positional Embedding）是一种向模型提供关于序列中每个元素位置信息的方法。最著名的位置嵌入实现出现在Google的Transformer模型中，此方法通过向每个序列元素的嵌入(embedding)中添加位置信息的向量来实现。这种方法的优点在于能够让模型学习到序列中元素的绝对位置信息。位置嵌入可以是固定的（如原始Transformer中所采用的正弦和余弦函数的组合）或是可学习的（即作为模型参数进行训练）。 2. **Rotary Emb (旋转位置编码)**： 旋转位置编码（Rotary Position Embedding，RoPE）是另一种在序列处理任务中传递位置信息的技术，近年来在某些模型中变得越来越流行（如RoFormer模型中的应用）。其核心思想是通过旋转每个维度的嵌入来编码位置信息，这种方式的优势在于它保持了相对位置的信息，而不是单纯的绝对位置。这意味着模型能够更好地捕捉序列中元素之间的距离和顺序关系。旋转位置编码通过数学上的旋转变换，使得同一位置的不同向量在经过旋转后能够保持它们的相对关系，这对于模型理解文本的上下文非常有帮助。 简而言之，\\"position emb\\"关注于为序列中的每个元素提供其绝对或可学习的位置信息，而\\"rotary_emb\\"则采用一种旋转变换的方法注入位置信息，更侧重于捕捉元素之间的相对位置关系。每种方法都有其优势，选择哪种方法取决于具体任务的需求和预期的模型表现。"},{"instruction":"旋转变换的数学实现","output":"旋转位置编码（Rotary Position Embedding, RoPE）的核心思想是通过旋转变换来编码序列中元素的位置信息。在旋转变换中，序列中每个元素的表示或嵌入在固定维度上被旋转了一个与位置相关的角度。这种方法能够保留元素间的相对位置信息，并被成功应用于处理自然语言处理（NLP）任务的模型中，如RoFormer。 为了理解旋转变换的数学实现，我们首先需要了解基本的二维旋转变换。在二维空间中，一个点(P(x, y))绕原点旋转(theta)度后的新位置(P'(x', y'))可以通过以下变换获得： [ begin{align*} x' &= xcos(theta) - ysin(theta) y' &= xsin(theta) + ycos(theta) end{align*} ] 这个变换可以用矩阵乘法表示为： [ begin{bmatrix} x' y' end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} cos(theta) & -sin(theta) sin(theta) & cos(theta) end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} x y end{bmatrix} ] 在旋转位置编码中，类似的原理被应用于序列中每个元素的嵌入向量。对于更高维度空间，旋转变换的思想可以通过对嵌入向量的组成部分（即维度）执行成对旋转来实现。对于一对维度((i, j))，其旋转变换可以表达为应用上述二维旋转矩阵。 假设我们有一个嵌入维度为(D)的序列元素嵌入向量，我们可以将其分为(frac{D}{2})对，每对执行一个独立的旋转变换。旋转的角度与元素的位置(p)相关，通常是通过学习或预定义函数来确定。 对于在(D)维空间中的向量，我们可以将其划分为(frac{D}{2})对，记作((x_{2i}, x_{2i+1}))，每对都将应用如下旋转变换： [ begin{bmatrix} x'_{2i} x'_{2i+1} end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} cos(theta_p) & -sin(theta_p) sin(theta_p) & cos(theta_p) end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} x_{2i} x_{2i+1} end{bmatrix} ] 其中，(theta_p)是与位置(p)相关的旋转角度，可以通过某种映射函数计算得到，例如基于序列位置的线性函数或更复杂的函数。 这种方式使得模型能够通过旋转的幅度捕捉到元素之间的相对位置信息，从而提升处理序列任务的能力，特别是在自然语言处理领域中。"},{"instruction":"为什么旋转每个维度的嵌入来编码位置信息，就能保持相对位置的信息","output":"旋转每个维度的嵌入来编码位置信息能够保持相对位置的信息，这是因为旋转操作本身在几何上是保持了向量之间相对角度和距离的一种变换，这使得旋转位置编码（Rotary Position Embedding, RoPE）特别适合于捕捉和利用序列中元素之间的相对位置关系。下面具体解释为什么这种方法可以保持相对位置信息： # 相对位置与旋转变换 在考虑序列中两个元素A和B时，假设它们的编码向量分别经过了与它们各自位置相关的旋转变换。由于每个元素的旋转角度是根据它们的位置计算得到的，那么两个不同位置的旋转角度之差（即(Deltatheta))是固定的，这个差值反映了A和B之间的相对位置。当在模型中处理这两个向量时，无论是直接计算它们的内积还是通过其他方式比较它们，这个旋转导致的相对角度差(Deltatheta)都会隐式地影响它们的相互作用。 # 保持距离和角度 旋转变换是一种保距（isometric）变换，意味着变换前后点之间的距离保持不变。在旋转位置编码中，通过为序列中的每个位置施加一个特定的旋转变换，可以保证：尽管序列中的每个嵌入都被旋转到了一个新的方向，但这些嵌入向量之间的相对位置（即它们之间的角度差和距离）被保留了下来。 # 增强模型的相对位置敏感性 通过将旋转变换应用于嵌入向量，模型可以更容易地通过比较向量之间的角度差异来推断序列中元素之间的相对位置。这种方法与传统的加入位置向量（position embeddings）的方法不同，后者往往提供了有关元素绝对位置的信息。旋转位置编码使得模型不仅能够理解各元素的位置，还能够理解元素间的相对距离，对于处理具有强序列依赖性的任务（如语言处理任务）而言尤为重要。 # 结论 因此，通过旋转每个维度的嵌入以编码位置信息，模型能够有效地捕捉和利用元素之间的相对位置关系，这对于理解序列数据的上下文和结构化信息是至关重要的。这种方法的显著优点是通过几何旋转的直观性和数学上保持相对距离与角度的特性，为复杂的序列处理任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。"},{"instruction":"can you tell me what does this regex do? const patternLink = /(?:https?://)?(?:[w.]+).(?:[a-z]{2,6}.?)(?:/[w.]*)*/?/g;","output":"This regular expression is used to match and extract URLs from a given string.

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求:

情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 13:33:12

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 14:21:56

participate in a variety of community services for CAS, and may support a variety of overseas development projects as well. You have been asked to write an annual leading report for your school. Your report should include the core aims of the organisation and your school's achievements this year in partnership with them.","output":"# Annual Leadership Report on Community and Service Initiatives Introduction Our school proudly continues its commitment to fostering a sense of global responsibility and compassion among our students, particularly those enrolled in the Diploma Programme (DP). Our aim is not only to excel in academic spheres but also to cultivate a well-rounded personality in our students through various initiatives. The core component of our outreach program is rooted in the principles of Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) – a fundamental element of the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme. Core Aims of the Organisation Our organization's mission is to encourage students to become active, compassionate, and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right. This philosophy is seamlessly integrated into our community service programs, which aim to: 1. **Foster Global Citizens**: Instill a sense of belonging to a broader community and common humanity. Our service projects aim to address global and local issues, promoting intercultural understanding and respect. 2. **Promote Personal Growth**: Through challenging and meaningful experiences, our initiatives are designed to promote students' personal and interpersonal development by learning through experience. 3. **Develop a Sense of Responsibility**: Encourage students to take part in the world around them as principled and informed contributors to society. Partnerships and Achievements This year, our school has achieved remarkable milestones in partnership with several overseas development projects, highlighting the dedication and passion of our DP students in contributing to significant causes: 1. **Water Purification Initiative in Kenya**: - **Objective**: To provide access to clean and safe drinking water in rural communities. - **Achievement**: Our students successfully raised 10,000, which was used to install new water purification systems in three villages, directly impacting over 5,000 residents. 2. **Educational Support Program in Nepal**: - **Objective**: To improve educational resources and infrastructures in underserved regions. - **Achievement**: Through various fundraising efforts, including online campaigns and school events, we managed to collect 15,000. This fund facilitated the construction of two new classrooms and provided essential learning materials for over 500 students. 3. **Healthcare Outreach in Brazil**: - **Objective**: To support healthcare facilities with resources and manpower in impoverished communities. - **Achievement**: A group of 20 students volunteered for a month, assisting local healthcare providers. They engaged in activities ranging from basic health checks to organizing health awareness camps, significantly benefiting approximately 1,000 individuals with their service. Conclusion The accomplishments of this year are a testament to the remarkable spirit of our DP students and their willingness to extend their learning beyond the confines of the classroom. These initiatives not only aid in the development of our students but also make a tangible difference in the global community. As we look forward to the upcoming year, we are inspired to continue expanding our reach and impact through our ongoing and future service projects. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our partners, supporters, and most importantly, our students, for their relentless dedication and effort. Together, we are not just teaching and learning about community service; we are living it."},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息:

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 14:06:16

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求: 根据time算出活动结束时间，与“当前时间”进行比较判断，如果当前时间大于等于活动结束时间，则为值2，当前时间小于活动结束时间，则值为1，无法判断则值为0，默认值为0 关于支付场景scene包括: 1、生活缴费(如：话费、水费、煤气费、电费) 2、影票 3、信用卡还款 4、餐饮美食 5、罚没 6、充电(如汽车充电) 7、机票 8、车票 9、船票 10、酒店住宿 11、租车 12、门票 13、购车

情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中
