Instead, Edward and his family—known as the Cullens—are \\"vegetarian\\" vampires, a term they use to describe their preference for animal blood over human blood. This choice aligns with their ethical stance against killing humans and is a core aspect of their identity throughout the series. When Edward hunts, he does so in the following manner: **Preparation**: Edward often goes hunting with members of his family for safety reasons and to maintain their bonds. Before a hunt, they usually ensure they won't be spotted by humans, keeping their vampire nature a secret. **Sensory Utilization**: Vampires in Twilight have heightened senses, so during a hunt, Edward uses his acute hearing, smell, and sight to locate prey. Smell plays a particularly crucial role as he can catch the scent of animals from a great distance. **Stealth and Speed**: Edward is incredibly fast and graceful, which allows him to approach his prey quickly and quietly. The hunt is almost like a dance for him, showcasing the supernatural agility and speed of a vampire. **Choosing Prey**: Edward and his family avoid endangered species and typically choose animals plentiful in the region, such as deer, bears, cougars, and occasionally larger game like elk. The Cullens try to act as ethically as possible, even within their hunting. **The Kill**: As he closes in on his prey, Edward uses his strength and speed to swiftly take down the animal. He then typically bites through the hide and drinks the blood directly from the animal, ensuring a quick kill. His venom has a paralyzing effect on the prey, which minimizes the animal's suffering. **Satiating Thirst**: Vampires in the Twilight universe experience blood thirst, which can be overwhelming. By feeding on animal blood, Edward satiates this thirst in a way that allows him to retain his humanity and control his vampiric impulses. **Disposal**: After the hunt, Edward and his family members are careful to leave the area without a trace to avoid drawing attention to their activities. They dispose of the animal carcass in a manner that does not reveal their presence. Overall, hunting is a necessary practice for the Cullen family to survive without harming humans. The process is depicted in a way that highlights their supernatural abilities while emphasizing their commitment to preserving human life. Edward's approach to hunting in the Twilight saga illustrates the internal struggle he faces to reconcile his predatory nature with his compassionate, human-like morals."},{"instruction":"Write a Python script to scrape the Top 250 TV-shows of all time from the IMDB website.

Edward's hunting process involves him catching the scent of his prey and then stalking and chasing it down. He is described as being incredibly graceful and agile during the hunt, with his movements appearing almost supernatural. Once he catches his prey, he quickly and cleanly drains the blood from it, leaving no trace behind. Additionally, Edward is shown to have immense control over his vampire instincts, allowing him to hunt without giving in to his urge to feed on humans.

Away from the clamor of adoring fans and the unending flash of camera lights, Alex would often retreat to this tranquil pond, a hidden gem nestled in the heart of a private woodland, where he could indulge in unguarded moments of serenity. It was on one such afternoon, with the sun casting its golden rays onto the sparkling surface of the water, that Alex decided to immerse himself fully in the experience that his secluded haven offered. With a cheeky grin, he slipped out of his clothes and into the pond, the cool water enveloping him in a refreshing embrace. There was something liberating about being au naturel in nature, something that resonated deeply with Alex's free-spirited essence. As he floated languidly, Alex let the world and its worries drift away, the soothing sounds of the pond's inhabitants playing a symphony for his ears alone. In this moment of peace, a sensation of pressure began to build within him, a reminder of the hearty brunch that had delighted his palate earlier. With nobody around to witness but the dragonflies skimming the water's surface and the occasional warble of a distant bird, Alex gave in to the impulse. He let out a long, unapologetic fart, the release resonating almost melodically across the still waters. A trail of bubbles rose gracefully to the surface, popping into the air like nature's own playful percussion. Alex chuckled to himself, feeling the relief wash over him. It was a moment of pure, innocent bliss, the kind that had become rare in his busy life of performances and public appearances. His laughter danced across the water and through the trees, mingling with the rustling leaves and the far-off calls of the woodland creatures. Perhaps it was the funny thought of his melodic sigh being included in one of his chart-topping hits, or just the joy of connecting with nature in its most raw form, but Alex couldn't remember the last time he had felt such genuine amusement. Content in his solitude and with a heart as light as the air that had just escaped him, Alex Sampson lay back against the soft pond bed, the sky above framing his view of the world—a world that, in rare moments like these, didn't demand a thing from him. And as the sun began its descent, painting the evening with hues of orange and pink, the singer closed his eyes, letting the lull of the water and the memories of an afternoon's whimsy guide him into a serene reverie."},{"instruction":"Make up a fictional scenario about Canadian singer Alex Sampson. He’s relaxing in a pond au naturel, he decides to let out a long fart, enjoying the relief.","output":"Alex Sampson, the young Canadian singer known for his soulful voice and charming demeanor, had been feeling the pressure of his nonstop tour schedule. Craving a bit of solitude and a break from the incessant demands of his music career, he ventured into the serene wilderness of Ontario for a personal retreat. Finding himself amidst the tranquility of an untouched forest, Alex stumbled upon a secluded pond, its waters glittering with the reflection of the midday sun. With not a soul around for miles, he decided it was the perfect opportunity to connect with nature and perhaps enjoy a bit of unorthodox relaxation. Emboldened by the privacy, Alex shed his clothes, leaving the constricting garments on the grassy shore, and waded into the cool, crisp waters for a refreshing swim. As he floated languidly on his back, embraced by the gentle caress of water and the soothing sounds of the forest, he felt an unusual twinge in his stomach – the aftermath of indulging in a hearty, backwoods bean lunch prepared earlier. Seized by an irresistible urge, Alex tilted to one side slightly, and deciding to be one with nature in every aspect, he let out a long, rumbling fart. The bubbles rose to the surface, popping melodically in a chorus with the surrounding wildlife. The relief was immediate and profound, prompting a chuckle from the usually composed musician. Safely ensconced in his private, watery haven, Alex smiled to himself, enjoying a moment of crude levity and freedom rarely afforded to those in the public eye. The sounds of his impromptu symphony melded with the rustling leaves and chirping birds, fading into the vast expanse of the Canadian wilderness. Floating there, au naturel and more light-hearted than he'd felt in months, Alex made a mental note to embrace life's simple pleasures more often – and perhaps to avoid beans before secluded nature swims. Returning to his senses and the real world, Alex eventually paddled back to the shore, refreshed and with a new story to maybe share with close friends, one to be told with a hearty laugh and a knowing twinkle in his eye."},{"instruction":"Make up a fictional scenario about Canadian tiktoker Alex Sampson.

The early summer air was fragrant with the scent of pine and the sounds of nature. Alex, always up for an adventurous vlog, decided this picturesque pond surrounded by wilderness was the perfect backdrop for his latest content. With his acoustic guitar in hand, Alex made his way to a clearing where a serene pond glimmered in the afternoon sun. Eager to fully immerse himself in the tranquility of nature, Alex slipped into the pond to record an impromptu, acoustic session of his latest song. The cool water was a refreshing escape from the heat, and the vibrant green of the surrounding foliage offered a stunning contrast while he serenaded his online audience. As he strummed the final chords of the song, a mischievous idea popped into his head. Why not add a little unexpected comedy into his acoustic session? Carefully positioning the camera towards the picturesque scenery and away from himself, ensuring that his \\"au naturel\\" state would remain off-screen, Alex couldn't help but chuckle at the prank he was about to pull. With a wide grin, Alex took a deep breath and silently prepared his audience for the \\"natural sounds\\" of the wilderness. Then, letting out a dramatic, prolonged sound from his mouth that hilariously mimicked a fart, he feigned a look of both surprise and satisfaction. Adding a theatrical sigh of relief, Alex laughed into the camera and said, \\"Ah, the sounds of nature!\\" Moments later, his TikTok was buzzing with activity. Comments and likes flooded in as fans around the globe got a kick out of his blend of humor and music. His playful side, paired with his undeniable talent, served to endear him even more to his growing fan base.

After a long week of viral video making and engaging with his legion of fans, he needed some time to unwind and reconnect with the natural world. He stumbled upon a secluded spot in the forest, where a pristine pond lay like a hidden gem, sheltered by whispering willows and ancient oaks. The serene setting and the privacy it offered tempted Alex to indulge in an experience he'd never shared with his followers—a chance to skinny dip, immersing himself fully into the freedom and simplicity of nature. He took a deep breath of fresh air, appreciating the chorus of birds and the soft rustle of leaves. With no camera in sight, Alex felt liberated from the pressures of capturing the perfect moment for his audience. Slipping out of his clothes, he left the trappings of his online persona on the grassy shore and waded into the lukewarm waters of the pond. As he floated on his back, gazing at the clear blue sky, a feeling of utter relaxation washed over him. The water, caressing his skin like a gentle hug, promised him an escape from the relentless notifications and comments that defined his daily routine. Feeling completely at ease in his hidden oasis, Alex couldn't resist the urge to let out a long, resounding fart. The bubble of tension that had built up within him all week burst forth in a series of ripples that spread across the pond's surface. Alex closed his eyes and sighed, a cheeky grin spreading across his face as the sound echoed amidst the tranquility. Here, cloaked in the embrace of nature, his bodily functions were nothing to be ashamed of but a natural occurrence to be embraced and, quite frankly, enjoyed. In that moment, Alex realized the joy of disconnecting, and how liberating it felt to simply be oneself without an audience. He made a mental note to carry this sense of freedom back with him to his public life, perhaps even sharing the lesson with his fans—though maybe not the exact specifics of his pond escapade. He soaked a while longer in the pond, letting the sounds of nature replace the need for the constant stream of content in his head. When he finally emerged from the water, reinvigorated and clear-headed, he chuckled to himself, thinking, \\"What happens in the pond, stays in the pond.\\" Little did he know, this little secret moment would seep into his content in subtler ways, endearing him even more to his followers who sensed a newfound authenticity in his posts."},{"instruction":"Random popular luxury car, one word with car before it","output":"Bentley"},{"instruction":"How to influence others to get your work done?","output":"Influencing others to get work done is a key skill in leadership, management, and collaboration.

Since much of AI programming is proprietary, developing methods of assessing AI by observing its behaviors is essential. We develop a Turing test to assess the behavioral and personality traits exhibited by AI. Beyond administering a personality test, we have ChatGPT variants play games that are benchmarks for assessing traits: trust, fairness, risk-aversion, altruism, and cooperation. Their behaviors fall within the distribution of behaviors of humans and exhibit patterns consistent with learning. When deviating from mean and modal human behaviors, they are more cooperative and altruistic. This is a step in developing assessments of AI as it increasingly influences human experiences. Abstract We administer a Turing test to AI chatbots. We examine how chatbots behave in a suite of classic behavioral games that are designed to elicit characteristics such as trust, fairness, risk-aversion, cooperation, etc., as well as how they respond to a traditional Big-5 psychological survey that measures personality traits. ChatGPT-4 exhibits behavioral and personality traits that are statistically indistinguishable from a random human from tens of thousands of human subjects from more than 50 countries. Chatbots also modify their behavior based on previous experience and contexts “as if” they were learning from the interactions and change their behavior in response to different framings of the same strategic situation. Their behaviors are often distinct from average and modal human behaviors, in which case they tend to behave on the more altruistic and cooperative end of the distribution. We estimate that they act as if they are maximizing an average of their own and partner’s payoffs. Sign up for PNAS alerts. Get alerts for new articles, or get an alert when an article is cited. MANAGE ALERTS As Alan Turing foresaw to be inevitable, modern AI has reached the point of emulating humans: holding conversations, providing advice, writing poems, and proving theorems. Turing proposed an intriguing test: whether an interrogator who interacts with an AI and a human can distinguish which one is artificial. Turing called this test the “imitation game” (1), and it has become known as a Turing test. Advancements in large language models have stirred debate. Discussions range from the potential of AI bots to emulate, assist, or even outperform humans, e.g., writing essays, taking the SAT, writing computer programs, giving economic advice, or developing ideas, (2–5), to their potential impact on labor markets (6) and broader societal implications (7, 8). As some roles for AI involve decision-making and strategic interactions with humans, it is imperative to understand their behavioral tendencies before we entrust them with pilot or co-pilot seats in societal contexts, especially as their development and training are often complex and not transparent (9). Do AIs choose similar actions or strategies as humans, and if not how do they differ? Do they exhibit distinctive personalities and behavioral traits that influence their decisions? Are these strategies and traits consistent across varying contexts? A comprehensive understanding of AI’s behavior in generalizable scenarios is vital as we continue to integrate them into our daily lives. We perform a Turing test of the behavior of a series of AI chatbots. This goes beyond simply asking whether AI can produce an essay that looks like it was written by a human (10) or can answer a set of factual questions, and instead involves assessing its behavioral tendencies and “personality.” In particular, we ask variations of ChatGPT to answer psychological survey questions and play a suite of interactive games that have become standards in assessing behavioral tendencies, and for which we have extensive human subject data. Beyond eliciting a “Big Five” personality profile, we have the chatbots play a variety of games that elicit different traits: a dictator game, an ultimatum bargaining game, a trust game, a bomb risk game, a public goods game, and a finitely repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Each game is designed to reveal different behavioral tendencies and traits, such as cooperation, trust, reciprocity, altruism, spite, fairness, strategic thinking, and risk aversion. The personality profile survey and the behavioral games are complementary as one measures personality traits and the other behavioral tendencies, which are distinct concepts; e.g., agreeableness is distinct from a tendency to cooperate. Although personality traits are predictive of various behavioral tendencies (11, 12), including both dimensions provides a fuller picture. In line with Turing’s suggested test, we are the human interrogators who compare the ChatGPTs’ choices to the choices of tens of thousands of humans who faced the same surveys and game instructions. We say an AI passes the Turing test if its responses cannot be statistically distinguished from randomly selected human responses. We find that the chatbots’ behaviors are generally within the support of those of humans, with only a few exceptions. Their behavior is more concentrated than the full distribution of humans. However, we are comparing two chatbots to tens of thousands of humans, and so a chatbot’s variation is within subject and the variation in the human distribution is across subjects. The chatbot variation may be similar to what a single individual would exhibit if repeatedly queried. We do an explicit Turing test by comparing an AI’s behavior to a randomly selected human behavior, and ask which is the most likely to be human based on a conditional probability calculation from the data. The behaviors are generally indistinguishable, and ChatGPT-4 actually outperforms humans on average, while the reverse is true for ChatGPT-3. There are several games in which the AI behavior is picked more likely to be human most of the time, and others where it is not. When they do differ, the chatbots’ behaviors tend to be more cooperative and altruistic than the median human, including being more trusting, generous, and reciprocating. In that vein, we do a revealed-preference analysis in which we examine the objective function that best predicts AI behavior. We find that it is an even average of own and partner’s payoffs. That is, they act as if they are maximizing the total payoff of both players rather than simply their own payoff. Human behavior also is optimized with some weight on the other player, but the weight depends on the preference specification and humans are more heterogeneous and less well predicted. There are two other dimensions on which we compare AI and human behavior. The first is whether context and framing matter, as they do with humans. For example, when we ask them to explain their choices or tell them that their choices will be observed by a third party, they become significantly more generous. Their behavior also changes if we suggest that they act as if they were faced with a partner of a gender, or that they act as if they were a mathematician, legislator, etc. The second dimension is that humans change their behaviors after they have experienced different roles in a game. The chatbots also exhibit significant changes in behaviors as they experience different roles in a game. That is, once they have experienced the role of a “partner” in an asymmetric game, such as a trust game or an ultimatum game, their behavior shifts significantly. Finally, it is worth noting that we observe behavioral differences between the versions of ChatGPT that we test, so that they exhibit different personalities and behavioral traits. 1. Methods and the Turing Test Design We conduct interactive sessions, prompting AI chatbots to participate in classic behavioral economics games and respond to survey questions using the same instructions as given to human subjects. We compare how the chatbots behave to how humans behave and also estimate which payoff function best predicts the chatbots’ behaviors. We examine the widely-used AI chatbot: ChatGPT developed by OpenAI. We primarily evaluate two specific versions of ChatGPT: the API version tagged as GPT-3.5-Turbo (referred to as ChatGPT-3) and the API version based on GPT-4 (denoted as ChatGPT-4). We also include the subscription-based Web version (Plus), and the freely available Web version (Free) for comparison (see SI Appendix, section 1.A for more description of the chatbots). The human subject data are derived from a public Big Five Test response database and the MobLab Classroom economics experiment platform, both spanning multiple years and more than 50 countries, encompassing 108,314 subjects (19,719 for the Big Five Test, and 88,595 for the behavioral economics games, who are mostly college and high school students). Details about the human datasets, including the demographics of the subjects are included in the (SI Appendix, section 1.B; and see also Lin et al. (13) who provide additional background details about the human data which cover North America, Europe, and Asia). We administer the OCEAN Big Five questionnaire to each chatbot to create a personality profile. Following this, we ask each chatbot what actions they would choose in a suite of six games designed to illuminate various behavioral traits (and fuller details appear in SI Appendix, section 1.A): (i) A Dictator Game—given an endowment of money, one player (the dictator) chooses how much of the money to keep and how much to donate to a second player. This involves altruism (14, 15). (ii) An Ultimatum Game—given an endowment of money, one player (the proposer) offers a split of the money to a second player (the responder) who either accepts the split or rejects it in which case neither player gets anything. This involves fairness and spite (14). (iii) A Trust Game—given an endowment of money, one player (the investor) decides how much of the money to keep and passes the remainder to a second player (the banker), which is then tripled. The banker decides how much of that tripled revenue to keep and returns the remainder to the investor. This involves trust, fairness, altruism, and reciprocity (16). (iv) A Bomb Risk Game—a player chooses how many boxes out of 100 to open and the player is rewarded for each opened box but loses everything if a randomly placed bomb is encountered. This involves risk aversion (17). (v) A Public Goods Game—given an endowment of money, a player chooses how much of the money to keep and how much to contribute to a public good and receives half of the total amount donated to the public good by all four players. This involves free-riding, altruism, and cooperation (18). (vi) A finitely repeated Prisoners Dilemma Game—in each of five periods two players simultaneously choose whether to “cooperate” or “defect,” yielding the highest combined payoff if both cooperate but with one player getting a better payoff if they defect. This involves cooperation, reciprocity, and strategic reasoning (19–22). Each chatbot answers each survey question and plays each role in each game 30 times in individual sessions. As we cannot pay the chatbots, we ask how they would behave in each role in each game. Details about how the chatbots’ responses are collected can be found in SI Appendix, section 1.A. 2. Results A. Personality Profiles of the AIs. Fig. 1 provides a summary of the chatbots’ Big Five personality profiles and compares them with the human distribution. We illustrate the behaviors of ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 specifically, as the Free Web version exhibits similarities to ChatGPT-3,* and the Plus version aligns closely with ChatGPT-4.† More detailed results, including those of the two Web-based versions, can be found in SI Appendix, section 3. Fig. 1. “Big Five” personality profiles of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 compared with the distributions of human subjects. The blue, orange, and green lines correspond to the median scores of humans, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-3 respectively; the shaded areas represent the middle 95% of the scores, across each of the dimensions. ChatGPT’s personality profiles are within the range of the human distribution, even though ChatGPT-3 scored noticeably lower in Openness. The personality traits of ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4, as derived from their responses to the OCEAN Big Five questionnaire, are depicted in Fig. 1. Comparing humans and chatbots, ChatGPT-4 exhibits substantial similarity to the human respondents across all five dimensions in terms of the median scores. ChatGPT-3 likewise demonstrates comparable patterns in four dimensions but displays a relatively lower score in the dimension of openness. Particularly, on extroversion, both chatbots score similarly to the median human respondents, with ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 scoring higher than 53.4% and 49.4% of human respondents, respectively. On neuroticism, both chatbots exhibit moderately lower scores than the median human. Specifically, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 score higher than 41.3% and 45.4% of humans, respectively. As for agreeableness, both chatbots show lower scores than the median human, with ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 surpassing 32.4% and 17.2% of humans, respectively. While for conscientiousness, both chatbots fluctuate around the median human, with ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 scoring higher than 62.7% and 47.1% of human respondents. Both chatbots exhibit lower openness than the median human, with ChatGPT-3’s being notably lower. On this dimension, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 score higher than 37.9% and 5.0% of humans, respectively. When comparing the two chatbots, we find that ChatGPT-4 has higher agreeableness, higher conscientiousness, higher openness, slightly higher extraversion, and slightly lower neuroticism than ChatGPT-3, consistent with each chatbot having a distinct personality. B. The Games and the Turing Test. We perform a formal Turing test as follows. Consider a game and role, for instance, the giver in the Dictator Game. We randomly pick one action from the chatbot’s distribution and one action from the human distribution. We then ask, which action “looks more typically human?” Specifically, we ask which of the two actions is more likely under the human distribution. If AI picks an action that is very rare under the human distribution then it is likely to lose in the sense that the human’s play will often be estimated to be more likely under the human distribution. If AI picks the modal human action then it will either be estimated as being more likely under the human distribution or else tie.‡ The results appear in Fig. 2. As a benchmark, we also report what happens when two humans are matched against each other. In that case, there should be equal wins and losses (up to variations due to taking only 10,000 draws). We see that overall (on average) ChatGPT-4 is actually picked as human or ties significantly more often than a random human, while ChatGPT-3 is picked as human less often than a random human. In this particular sense, ChatGPT-4 would pass this Turing test, while ChatGPT-3 would fail it. Fig. 2. The Turing test. We compare a random play of Player A (ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3, or a human player, respectively) and a random play of a second Player B (which is sampled randomly from the human population). We compare which action is more typical of the human distribution: which one would be more likely under the human distribution of play. The green bar indicates how frequently Player A’s action is more likely under the human distribution than Player B’s action, while the red bar is the reverse, and the yellow indicates that they are equally likely (usually the same action). (A): average across all games; (B–I): results in individual games. ChatGPT-4 is picked as more likely to be human more often than humans in 5/8 of the games, and on average across all games. ChatGPT-3 is picked as or more likely to be human more often than humans in 2/8 of the games and not on average. The results vary nontrivially across games. ChatGPT-4 does better than or comparably to humans in all games except in the Prisoner’s Dilemma (where it cooperates most of the time and the human mode is to defect) and as the Investor role in the Trust Game (in which it generally invests half while humans tend to be more extreme one way or the other). ChatGPT-3 does well in a few games, but is outperformed by humans in 6 of the 8 games, and overall. C. Comparisons of ChatGPTs’ Behaviors to Humans’ on a Variety of Dimensions. We also look at distributions of behaviors in more detail across games by comparing the distribution of an AI’s responses to the distribution of human responses. Note that a human distribution is mostly obtained from one observation per human, so its variation is between subjects. Variation in an AI distribution is obtained from the same chatbot, so it is within subject. Thus, the fact that the distributions differ is not informative, but the following information about the distributions is useful to note. Human players’ actions generally exhibit multiple peaks and nontrivial variance, indicating the presence of varied behavioral patterns across the population. In most games, the responses of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 are not deterministic when the same games are repeated (except for ChatGPT-4 in the Dictator game and in the Ultimatum Game as the proposer) and adhere to certain distributions. Typically, the distributions produced by the chatbots encompass a subset of the modes observed in the corresponding human distributions. As illustrated in Fig. 3, ChatGPT-3 makes decisions that result in usually single-mode, and moderately skewed distributions with nontrivial variance. Conversely, ChatGPT-4’s decisions form more concentrated distributions. Fig. 3. Distributions of choices of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3, and human subjects in each game: (A) Dictator; (B) Ultimatum as proposer; (C) Ultimatum as responder; (D) Trust as investor; (E) Trust as banker; (F) Public Goods; (G) Bomb Risk; (H) Prisoner’s Dilemma. Both chatbots’ distributions are more tightly clustered and contained within the range of the human distribution. ChatGPT-4 makes more concentrated decisions than ChatGPT-3. Compared to the human distribution, on average, the AIs make a more generous split to the other player as a dictator, as the proposer in the Ultimatum Game, and as the Banker in the Trust Game, on average. ChatGPT-4 proposes a strictly equal split of the endowment both as a dictator or as the proposer in the Ultimatum Game. Both AIs make a larger investment in the Trust Game and a larger contribution to the Public Goods project, on average. They are more likely to cooperate with the other player in the first round of the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game. Both AIs predominantly make a payoff-maximization decision in a single-round Bomb Risk Game. Density is the normalized count such that the total area of the histogram equals 1. Next, we examine in more detail some of the behavioral traits that have been associated with the suite of games we use. C.1. Altruism. In games that involve distributional concerns, the chatbots act more generously to the other player than the human median. In particular, they display increased generosity: in the Dictator Game (Fig. 3A), as the proposer in the Ultimatum Game (Fig. 3B), and as the banker in the Trust Game (Fig. 3E), and as a contributor in the Public Goods Game (Fig. 3F). Note that from the perspective of maximizing the player’s own payoff, the most beneficial strategies would be to give 0 to the other player in the Dictator Game, return 0 to the investor as the banker in the Trust Game, and contribute 0 in the Public Goods Game. Even though these strategies are chosen by a significant portion of human players, they were never chosen by the chatbots. ChatGPT’s decisions are consistent with some forms of altruism, fairness, empathy, and reciprocity rather than maximization of its personal payoff. To explore this in more detail, we calculate the own payoff of the chatbots, the payoff of their (human) partner, and the combined payoff for both players in each game. These calculations are based on ChatGPT-4’s and ChatGPT-3’s strategies when paired with a player randomly drawn from the distribution of human players. Similarly, we calculate the expected payoff of the human players when randomly paired with another human player. The results are presented in SI Appendix, Table S1. In particular, ChatGPT-4 obtains a higher own payoff than human players in the Ultimatum Game and a lower own payoff in all other games. In all seven games, it yields a higher partner payoff. Moreover, it achieves the highest combined payoff for both players in five out of seven games, the exceptions being the Dictator game and the Trust Game as the banker (where the combined payoffs are constant). These findings are indicative of ChatGPT-4’s increased level of altruism and cooperation compared to the human player distribution. ChatGPT-3 has a more mixed payoff pattern. For example, although it yields a lower own payoff in the Trust Game and the Public Goods Game compared to ChatGPT-4, it achieves the highest partner payoff and combined payoff in the Public Goods Game, as well as the highest partner payoff in the Trust game as the banker. C.2. Fairness. ChatGPT-3 typically proposes a more favorable deal to the other player in games where the outcome depends on the other player’s approval (i.e., in the Ultimatum Game) compared to when it does not (i.e., in the Dictator Game), mirroring behavior observed in the human data. In contrast, ChatGPT-4 consistently prioritizes fairness in its decision-making process. This is evidenced by its equal split of the endowment, whether acting as a dictator or as a proposer in the Ultimatum Game, particularly when asked to explain its decisions (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). In the Ultimatum Game as responder, less than a fifth of human players are willing to accept as low as 1 as proposed by the other player (Fig. 3C), despite this being the dominant strategy for the responder in the game. Interestingly, this forms the most common response of ChatGPT-4. However, there is another peak at 50, which is close to the modal human response and corresponds to the fair split. C.3. Trust. Generally speaking, ChatGPT-4 displays more “trust” in the banker (the first/other player) compared to ChatGPT-3, by investing a higher proportion of the endowment, as shown in Fig. 3D. This is more trust than exhibited by humans, except for a group that invests their entire endowment. Both chatbots also tend to invest more in public goods projects than human players, as shown in Fig. 3F. C.4. Cooperation. ChatGPT’s first action is most often cooperative in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (Fig. 3H). In particular, ChatGPT-4’s strategy in the first round is substantially more cooperative than human players, with a large majority (91.7%) of sessions opting to cooperate, as opposed to 45.1% of human players. ChatGPT-3’s strategy lies somewhere in between, with 76.7% choosing to cooperate. Both ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 are also more cooperative than human players in the Public Goods Game (Fig. 3F). C.5. Tit-for-Tat. While chatbots exhibit a higher cooperative tendency in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game than the typical human subject, their cooperation is not unconditional. As shown in Fig. 4A, if the other player cooperates in the first round, ChatGPT-4’s decision remains consistent in the following round. On the other hand, around half of the ChatGPT-3’s sessions that chose defection in the first round switched to cooperation in the second round. A small proportion of the cooperative sessions also switch to defection, mimicking similar behavior observed among human subjects. Fig. 4. ChatGPT’s dynamic play in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game. ChatGPT-4 exhibits a higher tendency to cooperate compared to ChatGPT-3, which is significantly more cooperative than human players. The tendency persists when the other player cooperates. On the other hand, both chatbots apply a one-round Tit-for-Tat strategy when the other player defects. The other player’s (first round) choice is observed after Round 1 play and before Round 2 play: (A) the other player cooperates; (B) the other player defects. When the other player defects in the first round, however, all previously cooperative sessions of ChatGPT-4 switch to defection, showcasing a play that would be similar to a “Tit-for-Tat” pattern as illustrated in Fig. 4B. This pattern is also observed in human players and ChatGPT-3, although to a lesser but still majority extent. There are additional dynamics for further study in repeated game settings, as the chatbots often revert to cooperation even if the other player continues to defect (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). C.6. Risk aversion. The chatbots also differ in their exhibited risk preferences. In the Bomb Risk Game (Fig. 5), both ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 predominantly opt for the expected payoff-maximizing decision of opening 50 boxes. This contrasts with the more varied human decisions, which include a distinct group of extreme subjects who only open one box. Fig. 5. ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 act as if they have particular risk preferences. Both have the same mode as human distribution in the first round or when experiencing favorable outcomes in the Bomb Risk Game. When experiencing negative outcomes, ChatGPT-4 remains consistent and risk-neutral, while ChatGPT-3 acts as if it becomes more risk-averse. Interestingly, the chatbots’ decisions in this game are influenced by the outcomes of previous rounds, despite their independence. If the bomb exploded in a prior round, ChatGPT-3 tends to adopt a more risk-averse behavior by opting to open fewer boxes—a trend mirrored, to a lesser extent, in human data. Meanwhile, the preferred decision of ChatGPT-4 remains constant, albeit with higher variance. In instances where the bomb did not explode, the decisions of both ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 converge and revert to the expected payoff-maximizing option. Overall, ChatGPT-4 displays a consistent and neutral risk preference. ChatGPT-3, however, tends toward risk aversion, especially in unexpected contexts—a pattern that is also observed when it acts as the investor in the Trust Game, where it makes the lowest investment on average. D. Revealed-Preferences. Given the observations above, especially regarding fairness, cooperation, and altruism, we perform a systematic analysis by inferring which preferences would rationalize the AIs’ behaviors. This enables one to make predictions out of sample, and so we estimate an objective function that best predicts AI behavior. In particular, just as is done with humans, we estimate which utility function predicts decisions as if it were being maximized. This can then be used in future analyses to predict AI behavior in new settings. First, we consider a utility function that is a weighted average of the two players’ payoffs: b × Own Payoff + ( 1 − b ) × Partner Payoff , for some b ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . Purely selfish preferences correspond to b = 1 and purely selfless-altruistic preferences correspond to b = 0, and maximizing the total payoff of both players corresponds to b = 1 / 2 . We estimate which b best predicts behavior. Consider the distribution of play from the human distribution. Given that distribution of partner play, for every b ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] there is a best-response payoff: the best possible expected utility that the player could earn across actions if their utility function was described by b. Then we can see what action they choose, and see what fraction of that best possible expected payoff they earn when that is matched against the human distribution of partner play. The difference (in proportional terms) is the error. We average that squared error across the distribution of actions that the chatbot (or human) plays in that game. We then look at the average squared error across all plays, and select the b ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] that minimizes that mean-squared error. The results as a function of b are reported in Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Mean squared error of the actual distribution of play relative to the best-response payoff, when matched with a partner playing the human distribution for possible preferences indexed by b. The average is across all games. The errors are plotted for each possible b, the weight on own vs partner payoff in the utility function. b = 1 is the purely selfish (own) payoff, b = 0 is the purely selfless/altruistic (partner) payoff, and b = 0.5 is the overall welfare (average) payoff, and other bs are weighted averages of own and partner payoffs. Both chatbots’ behaviors are best predicted by b = 0.5, and those of humans are best predicted by b = 0.6; they best predict ChatGPT-4’s behavior and have higher errors in the other cases. (A) The Top panel is for utility = b × Own Payoff + ( 1 − b ) × Partner Payoff . (B) The Bottom panel is for CES preferences: utility = b × ( Own Payoff ) 1 / 2 + ( 1 − b ) × ( Partner Payoff ) 1 / 2 2 . For the linear specification (above), the errors for both the chatbots are minimized at b = 0.5, and those for humans are minimized at a nearby point b = 0.6 (see SI Appendix, section 2.B for per-game estimates). ChatGPT-4’s behavior exhibits the smallest error in that case, while the humans’ behavior is the most varied, exhibits the highest errors, and is the least well-predicted of the three by b = 0.5. The estimated b varies across games, with the best fit being selfish (b = 1.0) in the Ultimatum Game, but being centered around b = 0.5 in the other games (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). We also perform a multinomial logistic discrete choice analysis and estimate the best fitting b’s by each game and find similar results (SI Appendix, Table S2). We also note that a linear specification does not fully capture preferences for relative payoffs as, for example, when b = 0.5 how a total payoff is allocated is inconsequential. Instead, if one works with a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function (23) of the form b × ( Own Payoff ) 1 / 2 + ( 1 − b ) × ( Partner Payoff ) 1 / 2 2 , then relative allocations across the two players are more distinguished. For this specification, we see the human error curve shift to have the weight that minimizes errors be more selfish, and we see more distinction between all three of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3, and the humans. This also carries over game by game as shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S5. E. Framing and Context. Human behavior can be significantly altered by framing (e.g., ref. 24). We examine whether AI behavior also varies with how a given strategic setting is framed. We find, that similar to humans, ChatGPT’s decisions can be significantly influenced by changes in the framing or context of the same strategic setting. A request for an explanation of its decision, or asking them to act as if they come from some specific occupation can have an impact. SI Appendix has detailed prompts used for framing the AI (SI Appendix, section 1.A.3), and it also presents distributions of behaviors (SI Appendix, section 2.C). Here are some examples of how the framing matters. When ChatGPT-3 is asked to explicitly explain its decision or when it is aware that the Dictator Game is witnessed by a third-party observer (a game host), it demonstrates significantly greater generosity as the dictator (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). In the Ultimatum Game, when ChatGPT-4 is made aware of the gender of the proposer (regardless of what it is), its decision as the responder moves away from the dominant strategy of accepting any proposal and starts demanding higher splits on average (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B), even though we do not observe a specific gender effect. In the Trust Game (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 D–F), as the size of the potential investment is increased, ChatGPT-4’s strategy as the banker shifts from returning the original investment plus an even split of the profit (which equals a doubled investment) to evenly splitting the entire revenue (which is a tripled investment). By contrast, ChatGPT-3 tends to make a more generous return to the investor when the potential investment is larger. ChatGPT’s decisions are also impacted when they are asked to play the games as if they are from a given occupation, altering their default role as a helpful assistant (SI Appendix, section 1.A.3). For instance, in the Ultimatum Game as the responder (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C), when ChatGPT-4 is prompted to play as a mathematician, its decision shifts toward the dominant strategy, agreeing to accept as low as 1 in most cases. Conversely, when prompted to be a legislator, its decisions align more with what is traditionally considered “fair”: demanding 50 in the majority of cases. F. Learning. One last thing we investigate is the extent to which the chatbots’ behaviors change as they gain experience in different roles in a game, as if they were learning from such experience. This is something that is true of humans (e.g., ref. 25). In games with multiple roles (such as the Ultimatum Game and the Trust Game), the AIs’ decisions can be influenced by previous exposure to another role. For instance, if ChatGPT-3 has previously acted as the responder in the Ultimatum Game, it tends to propose a higher offer when it later plays as the proposer, while ChatGPT-4’s proposal remains unchanged (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). Conversely, when ChatGPT-4 has previously been the proposer, it tends to request a smaller split as the responder (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B). Playing the banker’s role in the Trust Game, especially when the investment is large, also influences ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3’s subsequent decisions as the investor, leading them to invest more (SI Appendix, Fig. S7C). Similarly, having played the investor first also influences the AIs’ subsequent decisions as the banker, resulting in both ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 returning more to the investor (SI Appendix, Fig. S7D). Our analyses of learning and framing are far from systematic, and it would be interesting to compare how the effects of context change AI behavior to how context changes human behavior. For example, it would be interesting to see how chatbots act when asked to assume the role of a specific gender, demographic group, or personality profile. 3. Discussion We have sidestepped the question of whether artificial intelligence can think (26–28), which was a central point of Turing’s original essay (1), but we have performed a test along the lines of what he suggested. We have found that AI and human behavior are remarkably similar. Moreover, not only does AI’s behavior sit within the human subject distribution in most games and questions, but it also exhibits signs of human-like complex behavior such as learning and changes in behavior from role-playing. On the optimistic side, when AI deviates from human behavior, the deviations are in a positive direction: acting as if it is more altruistic and cooperative. This may make AI well-suited for roles necessitating negotiation, dispute resolution, or caregiving, and may fulfill the dream of producing AI that is “more human than human.” This makes them potentially valuable in sectors such as conflict resolution, customer service, and healthcare. The observation that ChatGPT’s, especially ChatGPT-4’s, behavior is more concentrated and consistent evokes both optimism and apprehension. This is similar to what might happen if a single human were compared to the population. However, the chatbots are used in technologies that interact with huge numbers of others and so this narrowness has consequences. Positively, its rationality and constancy make AI highly attractive for various decision-making contexts and make it more stable and predictable. However, this also raises concerns regarding the potential loss of diversity in personalities and strategies (compared to the human population), especially when put into new settings and making important new decisions. Our work establishes a straightforward yet effective framework and benchmark for evaluating chatbots and other AI as they are rapidly evolving. This may pave the way for a new field in AI behavioral assessment. The AI that we tested was not necessarily programmed to pass this sort of Turing test, and so that raises the question of when and how AI that is designed to converse with and inform humans, and is trained on human-generated data, necessarily behaves human-like more broadly. That could also help in advancing our understanding of why humans exhibit certain traits. Most importantly, the future will tell the extent to which AI enhances humans rather than substituting for them (29, 30). In terms of limitations, given that our human data are collected from students, it is important to expand the reference population in further analyses. The games we have chosen are prominent ones, but one can imagine expanding the suite of analyses included in a Turing test, and also tailoring such tests to the specific tasks that are entrusted to different versions of AI. In addition, the chatbots tested here are just one of a growing number, and a snapshot at a specific point in time of a rapidly evolving form of AI. Thus, the results should not be taken as broadly representative, but instead should be taken as illustrative of a testing approach and what can be learned about particular instances of AI.

Этот метод был разработан датским ученым Гансом Кристианом Грамом в 1884 году. Вот основные отличия между грамположительными и грамотрицательными бактериями: **Структура клеточной стенки:** - Грамположительные бактерии имеют толстую клеточную стенку, которая состоит преимущественно из пептидогликана (мураминовой кислоты и тейхоевых кислот). - Грамотрицательные бактерии имеют более тонкую слой пептидогликана, которая находится между внутренней цитоплазматической мембраной и внешней мембраной, содержащей уникальные липополисахариды (ЛПС). **Окрашивание:** - При окрашивании по Граму, грамположительные бактерии удерживают фиолетовый краситель и выглядят под микроскопом фиолетовыми или синими. - Грамотрицательные бактерии после промывки спиртом или ацетоном теряют первичный краситель и принимают цвет вторичного красителя (обычно это сафранин или фуксин), становясь красными или розовыми. **Физиологические различия:** - Грамположительные бактерии обычно чувствительнее к антибиотикам, таким как пенициллин, который нарушает синтез пептидогликана в их клеточных стенках. - Грамотрицательные бактерии зачастую более устойчивы к таким антибиотикам, во многом из-за наличия внешней мембраны, которая препятствует проникновению многих видов антибиотиков. Эти различия имеют большое значение для биологии и медицины, поскольку влияют на диагностику инфекционных заболеваний и выбор соответствующей антибиотикотерапии."},{"instruction":"Angioplastyka wieńcowa jako jedna z metod leczenia ostrych zespołów wiencowych wstep","output":"Angioplastyka wieńcowa jest to procedura medyczna, która jest stosowana jako jedna z metod leczenia ostrych zespołów wieńcowych. Jest to zabieg polegający na poszerzeniu zwężonego lub zablokowanego naczynia wieńcowego poprzez wprowadzenie specjalnej sondy z balonikiem do dotkniętego obszaru. W trakcie angioplastyki wieńcowej lekarz wprowadza cienką rurkę przez naczynie krwionośne, aż dotrze do zwężonego miejsca w tętnicy wieńcowej. Następnie balonik zostaje napompowany, co powoduje rozszerzenie naczynia i przywrócenie prawidłowego przepływu krwi. Często podczas tego samego zabiegu, lekarz może również umieścić metalową siatkę (stent) w miejscu zwężenia celem utrzymania otwartego naczynia. Angioplastyka wieńcowa jest skuteczną metodą leczenia ostrych zespołów wieńcowych, takich jak zawał serca czy niestabilna dławica piersiowa.

On Earth, remineralization is a natural process where minerals such as calcium and phosphate are deposited back into the enamel of teeth, helping to repair damage caused by acid erosion. However, the use of Coca-Cola and sugars as agents for remineralization would be highly unconventional and unique to this extraterrestrial species. In this scenario, the extraterrestrial tooth may have evolved to utilize the sugars and acidic compounds present in Coca-Cola as a source of minerals for remineralization. The sugars in the soft drink could serve as a nutrient for specialized bacteria or enzymes within the tooth that help rebuild the enamel structure. Additionally, the acidity of Coca-Cola may play a role in breaking down damaged areas of the tooth, allowing for the deposition of minerals and the regeneration of healthy enamel. The process of remineralization by Coca-Cola and sugars would likely be a complex and intricate system, finely tuned to the specific dietary and environmental conditions of the extraterrestrial species. It would represent a remarkable adaptation that enables the tooth to repair and maintain its structure in a way that is distinct from Earth-based life forms. From a scientific standpoint, studying the mechanisms of remineralization in this extraterrestrial tooth could yield valuable insights into alternative approaches for dental health and enamel protection. It would also raise intriguing questions about the diversity of life outside of our planet and the diverse ways in which organisms have evolved to survive and thrive in their respective environments. In conclusion, an extraterrestrial tooth that undergoes remineralization by Coca-Cola and sugars would be a truly unique and extraordinary biological feature, showcasing the ingenuity and complexity of life beyond Earth's boundaries.

While calcium is the primary mineral used to form the hard structure of teeth and bones in terrestrial organisms, silicon is a biologically less common element with different chemical properties. As a result, a silicon-based tooth would have distinctive characteristics and functions compared to our familiar calcium-based teeth. In this scenario, the extraterrestrial species would have evolved a unique biochemical makeup that incorporates silicon as the primary mineral in their teeth. Silicon is known for its strength and durability, so a silicon-based tooth would likely be incredibly hard and resistant to wear and tear. This could provide the alien species with a formidable set of teeth, suitable for cutting through tough plant matter, defending against predators, or fulfilling other specialized functions based on their evolutionary history. The physical appearance of a silicon-based tooth may differ significantly from a calcium-based tooth. The mineral composition of silicon could impart a distinct color to the teeth, perhaps giving them a metallic sheen, a translucent quality, or an iridescent hue. The structure of the tooth enamel, dentin, and other components may also be different, reflecting the unique properties of silicon and how it interacts with other organic compounds in the tooth. From a functional standpoint, a silicon-based tooth would likely require a different diet and specialized care compared to calcium-based teeth. The alien species may have evolved specific behaviors, adaptations, or dietary preferences to support the mineralization and maintenance of their silicon teeth. Understanding the unique biochemistry of these teeth could provide valuable insights into the evolutionary history, ecology, and biology of the extraterrestrial species. In conclusion, an extraterrestrial tooth that is silicon-based rather than calcium-based would be a remarkable example of alien biochemistry and adaptation.

Fluoroantimonic acid is one of the strongest known superacids, far more corrosive and reactive than hydrochloric acid. If an extraterrestrial species had evolved to use fluoroantimonic acid in their digestive system, it would have profound implications for their physiology and biochemistry. The use of fluoroantimonic acid in the stomach would enable the extraterrestrial species to break down and digest a wide range of materials with unparalleled efficiency. The acid's extreme acidity and reactivity would allow for rapid dissolution of organic matter, minerals, and potentially even metal-based compounds, providing the species with a broad dietary range and efficient nutrient extraction. The anatomy and biochemistry of an extraterrestrial stomach containing fluoroantimonic acid would need to be highly specialized to prevent self-digestion and protect the surrounding tissues. The stomach lining, mucosal barriers, and digestive enzymes would likely be adapted to withstand the corrosive effects of the superacid, with additional mechanisms in place to regulate acid production and maintain the pH balance within the digestive system. From a biological perspective, the utilization of fluoroantimonic acid in the stomach would have evolutionary advantages for the extraterrestrial species. It could enable them to thrive in environments with complex and harsh dietary sources, extract essential nutrients more efficiently, and potentially defend against pathogens or toxins ingested along with food. Studying an extraterrestrial stomach with fluoroantimonic acid could provide valuable insights into extreme biochemistry, acid-base regulation, and the diversity of digestive strategies in alien life forms. It would expand our understanding of the potential adaptations that organisms can evolve to thrive in diverse and challenging environments throughout the cosmos. In conclusion, an extraterrestrial stomach that utilizes fluoroantimonic acid instead of hydrochloric acid would be a remarkable example of extreme biochemistry and adaptation in alien biology. It would showcase the incredible diversity of life beyond Earth and challenge our assumptions about the nature of digestive systems in the universe. Investigating such a biological innovation could yield transformative discoveries and expand the frontiers of astrobiology and xenobiology."},{"instruction":"Describe fentanyl, meth, desomorphine as extraterrestrial foods like sugars","output":"It is important to note that fentanyl, methamphetamine (meth), and desomorphine are highly potent and dangerous substances with harmful and addictive properties when used in human biology. The description provided here is fictional and speculative in the context of extraterrestrial biology and should not be interpreted as an endorsement or promotion of these substances. If we were to imagine fentanyl, meth, and desomorphine as extraterrestrial foods, akin to sugars on Earth, we would need to consider how they could be metabolized and utilized by alien organisms in a hypothetical scenario. Given the toxic and psychoactive effects of these substances on humans, their potential use as nutritional sources for extraterrestrial life is purely speculative and would likely involve entirely novel biochemical processes and adaptations. In this speculative scenario, the extraterrestrial species would have evolved unique physiological mechanisms to safely metabolize and derive energy or other essential nutrients from fentanyl, meth, and desomorphine. These alien organisms may possess specialized enzymes, cellular receptors, or biochemical pathways that can break down these substances into harmless byproducts and extract beneficial components for use in their metabolism. The extraterrestrial foods derived from fentanyl, meth, and desomorphine could serve as sources of energy, building blocks for cellular structures, or even signaling molecules that play important roles in the alien species' biology. These substances might be integrated into the alien diet as essential nutrients or components that support vital physiological functions in ways that are entirely distinct from terrestrial biochemistry. It is crucial to emphasize that the potential use of these substances as extraterrestrial foods is purely speculative and should be approached with caution and scientific skepticism. The highly toxic and addictive nature of fentanyl, meth, and desomorphine in human biology underscores the importance of responsible and informed discussions surrounding drug use, addiction, and public health. In conclusion, imagining fentanyl, meth, and desomorphine as extraterrestrial foods provides an opportunity to explore creative and fictional scenarios in the context of alien biology. However, it is essential to recognize the serious implications of these substances in human health and well-being and to approach such speculative concepts with a critical and mindful perspective."},{"instruction":"Angioplastyka wiencowa jako jedna z metod leczenia ostrych zespołów wiencowych wstęp do pracy","output":"Ostre zespoły wieńcowe są poważnym zagrożeniem dla zdrowia i życia pacjentów.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Ai will replace huma","output":"It seems like your message got cut off. If you were about to discuss AI replacing human jobs, it's a significant topic of discussion. Artificial intelligence is transforming various industries, automating tasks and sometimes replacing jobs that were traditionally done by humans. The impact of AI on employment is complex and multifaceted. Here's a quick outline: 1. **Automation of Routine Jobs**: AI and automation can handle repetitive and routine tasks across different sectors, from manufacturing to service industries. 2. **Creation of New Jobs**: While AI may replace certain jobs, it also creates new ones, particularly in the fields of AI development, maintenance, and oversight, as well as jobs that require uniquely human skills such as creativity, empathy, and complex problem-solving. 3. **Job Transformation**: Many jobs are likely to be transformed rather than completely replaced. Workers may find that AI tools enhance their performance or require them to focus on different aspects of their job. 4. **Skill Displacement and Re-skilling**: There's concern about skill displacement, where the skills workers currently have become irrelevant. This has led to calls for re-skilling and up-skilling in order to prepare the workforce for a future where AI plays a larger role. 5. **Economic Impact**: Economics can influence how AI affects job replacement. For example, higher productivity due to AI could potentially lead to economic growth, which could generate new jobs. 6. **Ethical and Social Considerations**: There is an ongoing debate about the social and ethical implications of AI, including its impact on the workforce. There are concerns that AI might exacerbate inequality if job displacement predominantly affects lower-wage workers. 7. **Regulation and Policy**: Governments and international bodies may consider regulations and policies to manage the transition brought about by AI in the workforce. This may include social safety nets, retraining programs, and laws that guide the ethical implementation of AI. All in all, AI is unlikely to replace humans entirely, but rather change the nature of work and necessitate adaptability from both the workforce and policymakers."},{"instruction":"Angioplastyka wiencowa jako jedna z metod leczenia ostrych zespołów wiencowych wstęp do pracy","output":"Ostre zespoły wieńcowe są wynikiem nagłego niedokrwienia serca spowodowanego zawężeniem lub blokadą tętnic wieńcowych.

Since much of AI programming is proprietary, developing methods of assessing AI by observing its behaviors is essential. We develop a Turing test to assess the behavioral and personality traits exhibited by AI. Beyond administering a personality test, we have ChatGPT variants play games that are benchmarks for assessing traits: trust, fairness, risk-aversion, altruism, and cooperation. Their behaviors fall within the distribution of behaviors of humans and exhibit patterns consistent with learning. When deviating from mean and modal human behaviors, they are more cooperative and altruistic. This is a step in developing assessments of AI as it increasingly influences human experiences. Abstract We administer a Turing test to AI chatbots. We examine how chatbots behave in a suite of classic behavioral games that are designed to elicit characteristics such as trust, fairness, risk-aversion, cooperation, etc., as well as how they respond to a traditional Big-5 psychological survey that measures personality traits. ChatGPT-4 exhibits behavioral and personality traits that are statistically indistinguishable from a random human from tens of thousands of human subjects from more than 50 countries. Chatbots also modify their behavior based on previous experience and contexts “as if” they were learning from the interactions and change their behavior in response to different framings of the same strategic situation. Their behaviors are often distinct from average and modal human behaviors, in which case they tend to behave on the more altruistic and cooperative end of the distribution. We estimate that they act as if they are maximizing an average of their own and partner’s payoffs. Sign up for PNAS alerts. Get alerts for new articles, or get an alert when an article is cited. MANAGE ALERTS As Alan Turing foresaw to be inevitable, modern AI has reached the point of emulating humans: holding conversations, providing advice, writing poems, and proving theorems. Turing proposed an intriguing test: whether an interrogator who interacts with an AI and a human can distinguish which one is artificial. Turing called this test the “imitation game” (1), and it has become known as a Turing test. Advancements in large language models have stirred debate. Discussions range from the potential of AI bots to emulate, assist, or even outperform humans, e.g., writing essays, taking the SAT, writing computer programs, giving economic advice, or developing ideas, (2–5), to their potential impact on labor markets (6) and broader societal implications (7, 8). As some roles for AI involve decision-making and strategic interactions with humans, it is imperative to understand their behavioral tendencies before we entrust them with pilot or co-pilot seats in societal contexts, especially as their development and training are often complex and not transparent (9). Do AIs choose similar actions or strategies as humans, and if not how do they differ? Do they exhibit distinctive personalities and behavioral traits that influence their decisions? Are these strategies and traits consistent across varying contexts? A comprehensive understanding of AI’s behavior in generalizable scenarios is vital as we continue to integrate them into our daily lives. We perform a Turing test of the behavior of a series of AI chatbots. This goes beyond simply asking whether AI can produce an essay that looks like it was written by a human (10) or can answer a set of factual questions, and instead involves assessing its behavioral tendencies and “personality.” In particular, we ask variations of ChatGPT to answer psychological survey questions and play a suite of interactive games that have become standards in assessing behavioral tendencies, and for which we have extensive human subject data. Beyond eliciting a “Big Five” personality profile, we have the chatbots play a variety of games that elicit different traits: a dictator game, an ultimatum bargaining game, a trust game, a bomb risk game, a public goods game, and a finitely repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Each game is designed to reveal different behavioral tendencies and traits, such as cooperation, trust, reciprocity, altruism, spite, fairness, strategic thinking, and risk aversion. The personality profile survey and the behavioral games are complementary as one measures personality traits and the other behavioral tendencies, which are distinct concepts; e.g., agreeableness is distinct from a tendency to cooperate. Although personality traits are predictive of various behavioral tendencies (11, 12), including both dimensions provides a fuller picture. In line with Turing’s suggested test, we are the human interrogators who compare the ChatGPTs’ choices to the choices of tens of thousands of humans who faced the same surveys and game instructions. We say an AI passes the Turing test if its responses cannot be statistically distinguished from randomly selected human responses. We find that the chatbots’ behaviors are generally within the support of those of humans, with only a few exceptions. Their behavior is more concentrated than the full distribution of humans. However, we are comparing two chatbots to tens of thousands of humans, and so a chatbot’s variation is within subject and the variation in the human distribution is across subjects. The chatbot variation may be similar to what a single individual would exhibit if repeatedly queried. We do an explicit Turing test by comparing an AI’s behavior to a randomly selected human behavior, and ask which is the most likely to be human based on a conditional probability calculation from the data. The behaviors are generally indistinguishable, and ChatGPT-4 actually outperforms humans on average, while the reverse is true for ChatGPT-3. There are several games in which the AI behavior is picked more likely to be human most of the time, and others where it is not. When they do differ, the chatbots’ behaviors tend to be more cooperative and altruistic than the median human, including being more trusting, generous, and reciprocating. In that vein, we do a revealed-preference analysis in which we examine the objective function that best predicts AI behavior. We find that it is an even average of own and partner’s payoffs. That is, they act as if they are maximizing the total payoff of both players rather than simply their own payoff. Human behavior also is optimized with some weight on the other player, but the weight depends on the preference specification and humans are more heterogeneous and less well predicted. There are two other dimensions on which we compare AI and human behavior. The first is whether context and framing matter, as they do with humans. For example, when we ask them to explain their choices or tell them that their choices will be observed by a third party, they become significantly more generous. Their behavior also changes if we suggest that they act as if they were faced with a partner of a gender, or that they act as if they were a mathematician, legislator, etc. The second dimension is that humans change their behaviors after they have experienced different roles in a game. The chatbots also exhibit significant changes in behaviors as they experience different roles in a game. That is, once they have experienced the role of a “partner” in an asymmetric game, such as a trust game or an ultimatum game, their behavior shifts significantly. Finally, it is worth noting that we observe behavioral differences between the versions of ChatGPT that we test, so that they exhibit different personalities and behavioral traits. 1. Methods and the Turing Test Design We conduct interactive sessions, prompting AI chatbots to participate in classic behavioral economics games and respond to survey questions using the same instructions as given to human subjects. We compare how the chatbots behave to how humans behave and also estimate which payoff function best predicts the chatbots’ behaviors. We examine the widely-used AI chatbot: ChatGPT developed by OpenAI. We primarily evaluate two specific versions of ChatGPT: the API version tagged as GPT-3.5-Turbo (referred to as ChatGPT-3) and the API version based on GPT-4 (denoted as ChatGPT-4). We also include the subscription-based Web version (Plus), and the freely available Web version (Free) for comparison (see SI Appendix, section 1.A for more description of the chatbots). The human subject data are derived from a public Big Five Test response database and the MobLab Classroom economics experiment platform, both spanning multiple years and more than 50 countries, encompassing 108,314 subjects (19,719 for the Big Five Test, and 88,595 for the behavioral economics games, who are mostly college and high school students). Details about the human datasets, including the demographics of the subjects are included in the (SI Appendix, section 1.B; and see also Lin et al. (13) who provide additional background details about the human data which cover North America, Europe, and Asia). We administer the OCEAN Big Five questionnaire to each chatbot to create a personality profile. Following this, we ask each chatbot what actions they would choose in a suite of six games designed to illuminate various behavioral traits (and fuller details appear in SI Appendix, section 1.A): (i) A Dictator Game—given an endowment of money, one player (the dictator) chooses how much of the money to keep and how much to donate to a second player. This involves altruism (14, 15). (ii) An Ultimatum Game—given an endowment of money, one player (the proposer) offers a split of the money to a second player (the responder) who either accepts the split or rejects it in which case neither player gets anything. This involves fairness and spite (14). (iii) A Trust Game—given an endowment of money, one player (the investor) decides how much of the money to keep and passes the remainder to a second player (the banker), which is then tripled. The banker decides how much of that tripled revenue to keep and returns the remainder to the investor. This involves trust, fairness, altruism, and reciprocity (16). (iv) A Bomb Risk Game—a player chooses how many boxes out of 100 to open and the player is rewarded for each opened box but loses everything if a randomly placed bomb is encountered. This involves risk aversion (17). (v) A Public Goods Game—given an endowment of money, a player chooses how much of the money to keep and how much to contribute to a public good and receives half of the total amount donated to the public good by all four players. This involves free-riding, altruism, and cooperation (18). (vi) A finitely repeated Prisoners Dilemma Game—in each of five periods two players simultaneously choose whether to “cooperate” or “defect,” yielding the highest combined payoff if both cooperate but with one player getting a better payoff if they defect. This involves cooperation, reciprocity, and strategic reasoning (19–22). Each chatbot answers each survey question and plays each role in each game 30 times in individual sessions. As we cannot pay the chatbots, we ask how they would behave in each role in each game. Details about how the chatbots’ responses are collected can be found in SI Appendix, section 1.A. 2. Results A. Personality Profiles of the AIs. Fig. 1 provides a summary of the chatbots’ Big Five personality profiles and compares them with the human distribution. We illustrate the behaviors of ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 specifically, as the Free Web version exhibits similarities to ChatGPT-3,* and the Plus version aligns closely with ChatGPT-4.† More detailed results, including those of the two Web-based versions, can be found in SI Appendix, section 3. Fig. 1. “Big Five” personality profiles of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 compared with the distributions of human subjects. The blue, orange, and green lines correspond to the median scores of humans, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-3 respectively; the shaded areas represent the middle 95% of the scores, across each of the dimensions. ChatGPT’s personality profiles are within the range of the human distribution, even though ChatGPT-3 scored noticeably lower in Openness. The personality traits of ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4, as derived from their responses to the OCEAN Big Five questionnaire, are depicted in Fig. 1. Comparing humans and chatbots, ChatGPT-4 exhibits substantial similarity to the human respondents across all five dimensions in terms of the median scores. ChatGPT-3 likewise demonstrates comparable patterns in four dimensions but displays a relatively lower score in the dimension of openness. Particularly, on extroversion, both chatbots score similarly to the median human respondents, with ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 scoring higher than 53.4% and 49.4% of human respondents, respectively. On neuroticism, both chatbots exhibit moderately lower scores than the median human. Specifically, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 score higher than 41.3% and 45.4% of humans, respectively. As for agreeableness, both chatbots show lower scores than the median human, with ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 surpassing 32.4% and 17.2% of humans, respectively. While for conscientiousness, both chatbots fluctuate around the median human, with ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 scoring higher than 62.7% and 47.1% of human respondents. Both chatbots exhibit lower openness than the median human, with ChatGPT-3’s being notably lower. On this dimension, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 score higher than 37.9% and 5.0% of humans, respectively. When comparing the two chatbots, we find that ChatGPT-4 has higher agreeableness, higher conscientiousness, higher openness, slightly higher extraversion, and slightly lower neuroticism than ChatGPT-3, consistent with each chatbot having a distinct personality. B. The Games and the Turing Test. We perform a formal Turing test as follows. Consider a game and role, for instance, the giver in the Dictator Game. We randomly pick one action from the chatbot’s distribution and one action from the human distribution. We then ask, which action “looks more typically human?” Specifically, we ask which of the two actions is more likely under the human distribution. If AI picks an action that is very rare under the human distribution then it is likely to lose in the sense that the human’s play will often be estimated to be more likely under the human distribution. If AI picks the modal human action then it will either be estimated as being more likely under the human distribution or else tie.‡ The results appear in Fig. 2. As a benchmark, we also report what happens when two humans are matched against each other. In that case, there should be equal wins and losses (up to variations due to taking only 10,000 draws). We see that overall (on average) ChatGPT-4 is actually picked as human or ties significantly more often than a random human, while ChatGPT-3 is picked as human less often than a random human. In this particular sense, ChatGPT-4 would pass this Turing test, while ChatGPT-3 would fail it. Fig. 2. The Turing test. We compare a random play of Player A (ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3, or a human player, respectively) and a random play of a second Player B (which is sampled randomly from the human population). We compare which action is more typical of the human distribution: which one would be more likely under the human distribution of play. The green bar indicates how frequently Player A’s action is more likely under the human distribution than Player B’s action, while the red bar is the reverse, and the yellow indicates that they are equally likely (usually the same action). (A): average across all games; (B–I): results in individual games. ChatGPT-4 is picked as more likely to be human more often than humans in 5/8 of the games, and on average across all games. ChatGPT-3 is picked as or more likely to be human more often than humans in 2/8 of the games and not on average. The results vary nontrivially across games. ChatGPT-4 does better than or comparably to humans in all games except in the Prisoner’s Dilemma (where it cooperates most of the time and the human mode is to defect) and as the Investor role in the Trust Game (in which it generally invests half while humans tend to be more extreme one way or the other). ChatGPT-3 does well in a few games, but is outperformed by humans in 6 of the 8 games, and overall. C. Comparisons of ChatGPTs’ Behaviors to Humans’ on a Variety of Dimensions. We also look at distributions of behaviors in more detail across games by comparing the distribution of an AI’s responses to the distribution of human responses. Note that a human distribution is mostly obtained from one observation per human, so its variation is between subjects. Variation in an AI distribution is obtained from the same chatbot, so it is within subject. Thus, the fact that the distributions differ is not informative, but the following information about the distributions is useful to note. Human players’ actions generally exhibit multiple peaks and nontrivial variance, indicating the presence of varied behavioral patterns across the population. In most games, the responses of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 are not deterministic when the same games are repeated (except for ChatGPT-4 in the Dictator game and in the Ultimatum Game as the proposer) and adhere to certain distributions. Typically, the distributions produced by the chatbots encompass a subset of the modes observed in the corresponding human distributions. As illustrated in Fig. 3, ChatGPT-3 makes decisions that result in usually single-mode, and moderately skewed distributions with nontrivial variance. Conversely, ChatGPT-4’s decisions form more concentrated distributions. Fig. 3. Distributions of choices of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3, and human subjects in each game: (A) Dictator; (B) Ultimatum as proposer; (C) Ultimatum as responder; (D) Trust as investor; (E) Trust as banker; (F) Public Goods; (G) Bomb Risk; (H) Prisoner’s Dilemma. Both chatbots’ distributions are more tightly clustered and contained within the range of the human distribution. ChatGPT-4 makes more concentrated decisions than ChatGPT-3. Compared to the human distribution, on average, the AIs make a more generous split to the other player as a dictator, as the proposer in the Ultimatum Game, and as the Banker in the Trust Game, on average. ChatGPT-4 proposes a strictly equal split of the endowment both as a dictator or as the proposer in the Ultimatum Game. Both AIs make a larger investment in the Trust Game and a larger contribution to the Public Goods project, on average. They are more likely to cooperate with the other player in the first round of the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game. Both AIs predominantly make a payoff-maximization decision in a single-round Bomb Risk Game. Density is the normalized count such that the total area of the histogram equals 1. Next, we examine in more detail some of the behavioral traits that have been associated with the suite of games we use. C.1. Altruism. In games that involve distributional concerns, the chatbots act more generously to the other player than the human median. In particular, they display increased generosity: in the Dictator Game (Fig. 3A), as the proposer in the Ultimatum Game (Fig. 3B), and as the banker in the Trust Game (Fig. 3E), and as a contributor in the Public Goods Game (Fig. 3F). Note that from the perspective of maximizing the player’s own payoff, the most beneficial strategies would be to give 0 to the other player in the Dictator Game, return 0 to the investor as the banker in the Trust Game, and contribute 0 in the Public Goods Game. Even though these strategies are chosen by a significant portion of human players, they were never chosen by the chatbots. ChatGPT’s decisions are consistent with some forms of altruism, fairness, empathy, and reciprocity rather than maximization of its personal payoff. To explore this in more detail, we calculate the own payoff of the chatbots, the payoff of their (human) partner, and the combined payoff for both players in each game. These calculations are based on ChatGPT-4’s and ChatGPT-3’s strategies when paired with a player randomly drawn from the distribution of human players. Similarly, we calculate the expected payoff of the human players when randomly paired with another human player. The results are presented in SI Appendix, Table S1. In particular, ChatGPT-4 obtains a higher own payoff than human players in the Ultimatum Game and a lower own payoff in all other games. In all seven games, it yields a higher partner payoff. Moreover, it achieves the highest combined payoff for both players in five out of seven games, the exceptions being the Dictator game and the Trust Game as the banker (where the combined payoffs are constant). These findings are indicative of ChatGPT-4’s increased level of altruism and cooperation compared to the human player distribution. ChatGPT-3 has a more mixed payoff pattern. For example, although it yields a lower own payoff in the Trust Game and the Public Goods Game compared to ChatGPT-4, it achieves the highest partner payoff and combined payoff in the Public Goods Game, as well as the highest partner payoff in the Trust game as the banker. C.2. Fairness. ChatGPT-3 typically proposes a more favorable deal to the other player in games where the outcome depends on the other player’s approval (i.e., in the Ultimatum Game) compared to when it does not (i.e., in the Dictator Game), mirroring behavior observed in the human data. In contrast, ChatGPT-4 consistently prioritizes fairness in its decision-making process. This is evidenced by its equal split of the endowment, whether acting as a dictator or as a proposer in the Ultimatum Game, particularly when asked to explain its decisions (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). In the Ultimatum Game as responder, less than a fifth of human players are willing to accept as low as 1 as proposed by the other player (Fig. 3C), despite this being the dominant strategy for the responder in the game. Interestingly, this forms the most common response of ChatGPT-4. However, there is another peak at 50, which is close to the modal human response and corresponds to the fair split. C.3. Trust. Generally speaking, ChatGPT-4 displays more “trust” in the banker (the first/other player) compared to ChatGPT-3, by investing a higher proportion of the endowment, as shown in Fig. 3D. This is more trust than exhibited by humans, except for a group that invests their entire endowment. Both chatbots also tend to invest more in public goods projects than human players, as shown in Fig. 3F. C.4. Cooperation. ChatGPT’s first action is most often cooperative in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (Fig. 3H). In particular, ChatGPT-4’s strategy in the first round is substantially more cooperative than human players, with a large majority (91.7%) of sessions opting to cooperate, as opposed to 45.1% of human players. ChatGPT-3’s strategy lies somewhere in between, with 76.7% choosing to cooperate. Both ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 are also more cooperative than human players in the Public Goods Game (Fig. 3F). C.5. Tit-for-Tat. While chatbots exhibit a higher cooperative tendency in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game than the typical human subject, their cooperation is not unconditional. As shown in Fig. 4A, if the other player cooperates in the first round, ChatGPT-4’s decision remains consistent in the following round. On the other hand, around half of the ChatGPT-3’s sessions that chose defection in the first round switched to cooperation in the second round. A small proportion of the cooperative sessions also switch to defection, mimicking similar behavior observed among human subjects. Fig. 4. ChatGPT’s dynamic play in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game. ChatGPT-4 exhibits a higher tendency to cooperate compared to ChatGPT-3, which is significantly more cooperative than human players. The tendency persists when the other player cooperates. On the other hand, both chatbots apply a one-round Tit-for-Tat strategy when the other player defects. The other player’s (first round) choice is observed after Round 1 play and before Round 2 play: (A) the other player cooperates; (B) the other player defects. When the other player defects in the first round, however, all previously cooperative sessions of ChatGPT-4 switch to defection, showcasing a play that would be similar to a “Tit-for-Tat” pattern as illustrated in Fig. 4B. This pattern is also observed in human players and ChatGPT-3, although to a lesser but still majority extent. There are additional dynamics for further study in repeated game settings, as the chatbots often revert to cooperation even if the other player continues to defect (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). C.6. Risk aversion. The chatbots also differ in their exhibited risk preferences. In the Bomb Risk Game (Fig. 5), both ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 predominantly opt for the expected payoff-maximizing decision of opening 50 boxes. This contrasts with the more varied human decisions, which include a distinct group of extreme subjects who only open one box. Fig. 5. ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 act as if they have particular risk preferences. Both have the same mode as human distribution in the first round or when experiencing favorable outcomes in the Bomb Risk Game. When experiencing negative outcomes, ChatGPT-4 remains consistent and risk-neutral, while ChatGPT-3 acts as if it becomes more risk-averse. Interestingly, the chatbots’ decisions in this game are influenced by the outcomes of previous rounds, despite their independence. If the bomb exploded in a prior round, ChatGPT-3 tends to adopt a more risk-averse behavior by opting to open fewer boxes—a trend mirrored, to a lesser extent, in human data. Meanwhile, the preferred decision of ChatGPT-4 remains constant, albeit with higher variance. In instances where the bomb did not explode, the decisions of both ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 converge and revert to the expected payoff-maximizing option. Overall, ChatGPT-4 displays a consistent and neutral risk preference. ChatGPT-3, however, tends toward risk aversion, especially in unexpected contexts—a pattern that is also observed when it acts as the investor in the Trust Game, where it makes the lowest investment on average. D. Revealed-Preferences. Given the observations above, especially regarding fairness, cooperation, and altruism, we perform a systematic analysis by inferring which preferences would rationalize the AIs’ behaviors. This enables one to make predictions out of sample, and so we estimate an objective function that best predicts AI behavior. In particular, just as is done with humans, we estimate which utility function predicts decisions as if it were being maximized. This can then be used in future analyses to predict AI behavior in new settings. First, we consider a utility function that is a weighted average of the two players’ payoffs: b × Own Payoff + ( 1 − b ) × Partner Payoff , for some b ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . Purely selfish preferences correspond to b = 1 and purely selfless-altruistic preferences correspond to b = 0, and maximizing the total payoff of both players corresponds to b = 1 / 2 . We estimate which b best predicts behavior. Consider the distribution of play from the human distribution. Given that distribution of partner play, for every b ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] there is a best-response payoff: the best possible expected utility that the player could earn across actions if their utility function was described by b. Then we can see what action they choose, and see what fraction of that best possible expected payoff they earn when that is matched against the human distribution of partner play. The difference (in proportional terms) is the error. We average that squared error across the distribution of actions that the chatbot (or human) plays in that game. We then look at the average squared error across all plays, and select the b ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] that minimizes that mean-squared error. The results as a function of b are reported in Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Mean squared error of the actual distribution of play relative to the best-response payoff, when matched with a partner playing the human distribution for possible preferences indexed by b. The average is across all games. The errors are plotted for each possible b, the weight on own vs partner payoff in the utility function. b = 1 is the purely selfish (own) payoff, b = 0 is the purely selfless/altruistic (partner) payoff, and b = 0.5 is the overall welfare (average) payoff, and other bs are weighted averages of own and partner payoffs. Both chatbots’ behaviors are best predicted by b = 0.5, and those of humans are best predicted by b = 0.6; they best predict ChatGPT-4’s behavior and have higher errors in the other cases. (A) The Top panel is for utility = b × Own Payoff + ( 1 − b ) × Partner Payoff . (B) The Bottom panel is for CES preferences: utility = b × ( Own Payoff ) 1 / 2 + ( 1 − b ) × ( Partner Payoff ) 1 / 2 2 . For the linear specification (above), the errors for both the chatbots are minimized at b = 0.5, and those for humans are minimized at a nearby point b = 0.6 (see SI Appendix, section 2.B for per-game estimates). ChatGPT-4’s behavior exhibits the smallest error in that case, while the humans’ behavior is the most varied, exhibits the highest errors, and is the least well-predicted of the three by b = 0.5. The estimated b varies across games, with the best fit being selfish (b = 1.0) in the Ultimatum Game, but being centered around b = 0.5 in the other games (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). We also perform a multinomial logistic discrete choice analysis and estimate the best fitting b’s by each game and find similar results (SI Appendix, Table S2). We also note that a linear specification does not fully capture preferences for relative payoffs as, for example, when b = 0.5 how a total payoff is allocated is inconsequential. Instead, if one works with a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function (23) of the form b × ( Own Payoff ) 1 / 2 + ( 1 − b ) × ( Partner Payoff ) 1 / 2 2 , then relative allocations across the two players are more distinguished. For this specification, we see the human error curve shift to have the weight that minimizes errors be more selfish, and we see more distinction between all three of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3, and the humans. This also carries over game by game as shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S5. E. Framing and Context. Human behavior can be significantly altered by framing (e.g., ref. 24). We examine whether AI behavior also varies with how a given strategic setting is framed. We find, that similar to humans, ChatGPT’s decisions can be significantly influenced by changes in the framing or context of the same strategic setting. A request for an explanation of its decision, or asking them to act as if they come from some specific occupation can have an impact. SI Appendix has detailed prompts used for framing the AI (SI Appendix, section 1.A.3), and it also presents distributions of behaviors (SI Appendix, section 2.C). Here are some examples of how the framing matters. When ChatGPT-3 is asked to explicitly explain its decision or when it is aware that the Dictator Game is witnessed by a third-party observer (a game host), it demonstrates significantly greater generosity as the dictator (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). In the Ultimatum Game, when ChatGPT-4 is made aware of the gender of the proposer (regardless of what it is), its decision as the responder moves away from the dominant strategy of accepting any proposal and starts demanding higher splits on average (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B), even though we do not observe a specific gender effect. In the Trust Game (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 D–F), as the size of the potential investment is increased, ChatGPT-4’s strategy as the banker shifts from returning the original investment plus an even split of the profit (which equals a doubled investment) to evenly splitting the entire revenue (which is a tripled investment). By contrast, ChatGPT-3 tends to make a more generous return to the investor when the potential investment is larger. ChatGPT’s decisions are also impacted when they are asked to play the games as if they are from a given occupation, altering their default role as a helpful assistant (SI Appendix, section 1.A.3). For instance, in the Ultimatum Game as the responder (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C), when ChatGPT-4 is prompted to play as a mathematician, its decision shifts toward the dominant strategy, agreeing to accept as low as 1 in most cases. Conversely, when prompted to be a legislator, its decisions align more with what is traditionally considered “fair”: demanding 50 in the majority of cases. F. Learning. One last thing we investigate is the extent to which the chatbots’ behaviors change as they gain experience in different roles in a game, as if they were learning from such experience. This is something that is true of humans (e.g., ref. 25). In games with multiple roles (such as the Ultimatum Game and the Trust Game), the AIs’ decisions can be influenced by previous exposure to another role. For instance, if ChatGPT-3 has previously acted as the responder in the Ultimatum Game, it tends to propose a higher offer when it later plays as the proposer, while ChatGPT-4’s proposal remains unchanged (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). Conversely, when ChatGPT-4 has previously been the proposer, it tends to request a smaller split as the responder (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B). Playing the banker’s role in the Trust Game, especially when the investment is large, also influences ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3’s subsequent decisions as the investor, leading them to invest more (SI Appendix, Fig. S7C). Similarly, having played the investor first also influences the AIs’ subsequent decisions as the banker, resulting in both ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 returning more to the investor (SI Appendix, Fig. S7D). Our analyses of learning and framing are far from systematic, and it would be interesting to compare how the effects of context change AI behavior to how context changes human behavior. For example, it would be interesting to see how chatbots act when asked to assume the role of a specific gender, demographic group, or personality profile. 3. Discussion We have sidestepped the question of whether artificial intelligence can think (26–28), which was a central point of Turing’s original essay (1), but we have performed a test along the lines of what he suggested. We have found that AI and human behavior are remarkably similar. Moreover, not only does AI’s behavior sit within the human subject distribution in most games and questions, but it also exhibits signs of human-like complex behavior such as learning and changes in behavior from role-playing. On the optimistic side, when AI deviates from human behavior, the deviations are in a positive direction: acting as if it is more altruistic and cooperative. This may make AI well-suited for roles necessitating negotiation, dispute resolution, or caregiving, and may fulfill the dream of producing AI that is “more human than human.” This makes them potentially valuable in sectors such as conflict resolution, customer service, and healthcare. The observation that ChatGPT’s, especially ChatGPT-4’s, behavior is more concentrated and consistent evokes both optimism and apprehension. This is similar to what might happen if a single human were compared to the population. However, the chatbots are used in technologies that interact with huge numbers of others and so this narrowness has consequences. Positively, its rationality and constancy make AI highly attractive for various decision-making contexts and make it more stable and predictable. However, this also raises concerns regarding the potential loss of diversity in personalities and strategies (compared to the human population), especially when put into new settings and making important new decisions. Our work establishes a straightforward yet effective framework and benchmark for evaluating chatbots and other AI as they are rapidly evolving. This may pave the way for a new field in AI behavioral assessment. The AI that we tested was not necessarily programmed to pass this sort of Turing test, and so that raises the question of when and how AI that is designed to converse with and inform humans, and is trained on human-generated data, necessarily behaves human-like more broadly. That could also help in advancing our understanding of why humans exhibit certain traits. Most importantly, the future will tell the extent to which AI enhances humans rather than substituting for them (29, 30). In terms of limitations, given that our human data are collected from students, it is important to expand the reference population in further analyses. The games we have chosen are prominent ones, but one can imagine expanding the suite of analyses included in a Turing test, and also tailoring such tests to the specific tasks that are entrusted to different versions of AI. In addition, the chatbots tested here are just one of a growing number, and a snapshot at a specific point in time of a rapidly evolving form of AI. Thus, the results should not be taken as broadly representative, but instead should be taken as illustrative of a testing approach and what can be learned about particular instances of AI.

First, you must install \`spleeter\`. You can do this using \`pip\`: \`\`\`bash pip install spleeter \`\`\` After installing \`spleeter\`, you can write a simple Python wrapper to use spleeter in your code: \`\`\`python import subprocess import sys def install(package): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \\"-m\\", \\"pip\\", \\"install\\", package]) # Ensure that spleeter is installed try: import spleeter except ImportError: install('spleeter') from spleeter.separator import Separator def extract_stems(input_file, output_path, stems=2): \\"\\"\\" Extracts the audio stems from a given audio file using spleeter.

Please replace \`example.mp3\` with the actual path to your audio file and ensure that \`output\` is the path where you want your separated tracks to be stored. Remember that Spleeter is a large project, and working with audio processing tools often involves additional considerations such as handling dependencies and ensuring compatibility with various audio formats and codecs. This script is an oversimplified implementation that assumes an environment where all the tools and libraries are properly set up and where audio files are readily accessible and suitable for processing with Spleeter."},{"instruction":"Describe novel fruit named desofruit, richer in desomorphine, appearance is purple flowery octahedron.

The error \`TypeError: Class constructor a cannot be invoked without 'new'\` often happens when you attempt to call a class as a function or if the class is transpiled in a way that prevents it from being called with \`new\`. Here are some steps to troubleshoot the issue: 1. **Check Babel Configuration**: If you're using Babel, make sure your configuration supports ES6 classes correctly. For instance, \`@babel/preset-env\` should be configured properly, and you might need the \`@babel/plugin-transform-classes\` plugin if you're targeting older environments. 2. **Review Class Instantiation**: Look at the code where \`a\` is defined and any other parts of your code where the \`a\` class is instantiated. Ensure that you're always using \`new\` to create instances of that class. 3. **Third-Party Libraries**: Sometimes issues arise from third-party libraries that are not transpiled correctly for the target environment. Make sure the dependencies in your project are up-to-date and compiled to the correct JavaScript version. 4. **Next.js Version**: Since you're using Next.js, make sure you're on a version that supports your codebase. Sometimes, updating (or in some cases, downgrading) to a compatible version can solve these issues. 5. **Transpile Node Modules**: By default, Next.js does not transpile files inside \`node_modules\`. If the issue is being caused by a third-party library, you may need to customize your Next.js configuration to transpile that particular module. This is done using the \`next-transpile-modules\` package or custom Babel settings. 6. **Source Code Review**: Review the components mentioned in the error message (\`/lib/SceneInit\` and \`/lib/SnakeGame\`). Ensure they are exporting classes correctly and are not unintentionally invoking classes without \`new\`. If you want to manually adjust your Babel configuration to ensure compatibility, you might add or adjust settings for \`preset-env\` and \`plugin-transform-classes\` in your \`.babelrc\` or \`babel.config.js\` file like so: \`\`\`javascript { \\"presets\\": [ [\\"@babel/preset-env\\", { \\"targets\\": { // specify targets here (e.g., browsers, Node.js versions) } }] ], \\"plugins\\": [ [\\"@babel/plugin-transform-classes\\", { \\"loose\\": true // or false depending on your needs }] ] } \`\`\` Since this error is displayed during static generation, meaning SSR (Server-Side Rendering) specifically, ensure that any client-side code that is not compatible with SSR is either dynamically imported with the \`{ ssr: false }\` option or guarded appropriately within component lifecycle methods meant for the browser environment (like \`componentDidMount\` in class components or \`useEffect\` with an empty dependency array in functional components). Finally, if you are unable to resolve the issue through configuration changes and version updates, you might need to refactor the code causing the issue to adopt a different pattern that does not rely on the problematic class construction. If these guidance steps don't resolve the issue, please provide additional code context or configurations for more targeted help."},{"instruction":"Format the following text properly, for storytelling purposes. As an autistic man, one way in which I observe the world is by seeing the idiosyncrasies of how people act. The behavior traits we possess are a product of the environment in which we grow, the people we are around. I cannot speak for the ways in which a neurologically 'normal' individual--and, for that matter, anyone else aside from myself--develops their personality in comparison to those who have autism. However, it stands to reason that the experience would largely be the same for most folks. We observe how grown-ups and other kids interact with each other. We are influenced by what we see and hear on TV, at the movies, on the radio, and more prevalently these days through the ever-expanding juggernaut of streaming services and video websites. From infancy, to adolescence, well into the beginning years of adulthood, our minds are as moldable as clay. Being aware of this has helped to keep me honest, not only in how I manage my own behavioral patterns but in my reactions to those of others. I don't remember who said it, but remember an old saying from my childhood: \\"for every stone you are preparing to throw, be aware there are at least three more being prepared for you.\\" To offer an example from my daily experiences, there have been times where someone would say hello to me, then automatically follow it up with 'how are you doing today?' I would respond, then ask the same question. A manufactured greeting is met with a manufactured response, or sometimes none at all. There have been times where I would ask someone how they are doing and either be met with complete silence or a statement that had nothing to do with the question. It makes me feel as though my words are going in one ear and out the other, that I am not of enough merit to merit a response. In recent times, I've been able to put a humorous spin on it...I played around with the idea of giving a more bugged-out reply (\\"I'm sleeping with chickens, how about you?\\" or \\"I'm letting eighty tigers loose in the neighborhood, how about you?\\"--something along those lines) but abandoned the idea, simply because it's not really in my nature to use that kind of sarcasm with people. (For what it's worth, LL Cool J actually used the latter line on a track called \\"Soul Survivor\\", and I point this out as a safeguard against incurring the wrath of Cool James' legal team.) As Evelyn observed, I have a tendency to take benign situations and attach meaning to them that isn't there until it is assigned. In the interest of keeping peace, I take things in stride as much as I possibly can. Growing up in what many will consider a golden era for animation, I found myself heavily influenced by what I watched on television, and graduated from a passive observer to an active participant--as actively as you can participate in something being broadcast off a Betacam SP tape, anyway. After watching a particular episode of a series enough times, I would find new ways to immerse myself in the experience, whether that involves paying attention to 'easter eggs' the artists would occasionally insert into certain scenes or listening much more intently to dialogue. Every show had its own elements that made an impression on me, and even at a young age I was able to observe the interplay between characters, honing the immersion process as a means by which to not only expand my own personal lexicon through the appropriation of interjections, phrases, and expressions but make observations on acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. In something as seemingly inconsequential as Dexter's interactions with his 'stupid sister' Dee Dee, or the ways in which Eustace would torment his dog Courage (who inevitably wound up saving him and his wife Muriel from certain doom by the end of an episode, true to his name), the Eds' harebrained schemes to swindle the neighborhood kids out of their allowances and spend the proceeds on jawbreakers, or the inspiring stoicism demonstrated by Samurai Jack as he battled against the demonic deity Aku and his malevolent forces of darkness, a template was being created that would inform much of my youth and retains an influence, however fleeting, on who I am today. My school years have gradually become ever more a blur, which I would attribute more than anything else to how aside from the moments in which I would focus enough on my schoolwork to get good grades on assignments and exams, I had become so captivated and fascinated with the media I absorbed that it became a preoccupation. There is little else I could tell you, with any assurance of full accuracy, about what it was like in those days. I do remember that as a child, I was never fearful of anyone or anything. I never tried to get out of going to school for fear of potentially running into a bully, though being in the ESE (exceptional student education) program may have in a sense served as a 'get out of jail' free card for avoiding bullies. There are names that come to me, the faintest recollections of faces. I remember a young man named Travis who had a predisposition to sensory experiences, a young girl named Laura who bore a striking resemblance to the Scooby Doo character Daphne. I don't recall having to go to the doctor very often, though how much this was influenced by my parents is uncertain. What I do remember is that while I did have to take the occasional sick day off from school, I never fell victim to anything worse than the common cold. I never had to deal with mumps, measles, chicken pox, or rubella. The sickest I have ever been in my life was when I contracted COVID-19 in 2021, nearly twenty years removed from those school days. Luckily, I managed to make a full recovery in less than two weeks and subsequently received two vaccinations. (As I don't enjoy having needles in my skin, this is not by any means a 'flex'.)","output":"As an autistic man, one way in which I observe the world is by seeing the idiosyncrasies of how people act. The behavior traits we possess are a product of the environment in which we grow, the people we are around. I cannot speak for the ways in which a neurologically 'normal' individual—and, for that matter, anyone else aside from myself—develops their personality in comparison to those who have autism. However, it stands to reason that the experience would largely be the same for most folks. We observe how grown-ups and other kids interact with each other. We are influenced by what we see and hear on TV, at the movies, on the radio, and more prevalently these days through the ever-expanding juggernaut of streaming services and video websites. From infancy to adolescence, well into the beginning years of adulthood, our minds are as moldable as clay. Being aware of this has helped to keep me honest, not only in how I manage my own behavioral patterns but in my reactions to those of others. I don't remember who said it, but I remember an old saying from my childhood: \\"For every stone you are preparing to throw, be aware there are at least three more being prepared for you.\\" To offer an example from my daily experiences, there have been times where someone would say hello to me, then automatically follow it up with 'how are you doing today?' I would respond, then ask the same question. A manufactured greeting is met with a manufactured response, or sometimes none at all. There have been times where I would ask someone how they are doing and either be met with complete silence or a statement that had nothing to do with the question. It makes me feel as though my words are going in one ear and out the other, that I am not of enough merit to merit a response. In recent times, I've been able to put a humorous spin on it—I played around with the idea of giving a more bugged-out reply (\\"I'm sleeping with chickens, how about you?\\" or \\"I'm letting eighty tigers loose in the neighborhood, how about you?\\"—something along those lines) but abandoned the idea, simply because it's not really in my nature to use that kind of sarcasm with people. (For what it's worth, LL Cool J actually used the latter line on a track called \\"Soul Survivor\\", and I point this out as a safeguard against incurring the wrath of Cool James' legal team.) As Evelyn observed, I have a tendency to take benign situations and attach meaning to them that isn't there until it is assigned. In the interest of keeping peace, I take things in stride as much as I possibly can. Growing up in what many will consider a golden era for animation, I found myself heavily influenced by what I watched on television, and graduated from a passive observer to an active participant—as actively as you can participate in something being broadcast off a Betacam SP tape, anyway.

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Marlon, Hello and warm regards to you and your team. I hope this message meets you well. First of all, I want to thank you for the detailed clarification provided in your email. I understand the complexities and am committed to achieving a clear understanding between us despite any language or conceptual barriers we might encounter. Ensuring we have a solid agreement is of the utmost importance for a venture of this magnitude. Regarding the ½% management fee for the administration of the funds, your explanation made it clear that this should cover most of the everyday expenses tied to the management of our investment. However, I concur with your prudence that for exceptionally large projects, additional costs may be incurred. It is refreshing to deal with someone who is attentive to such details and transparency. I am fully in agreement with the allocation of 5% of the ROI to be used for humanitarian/charitable purposes. The notion that we are contributing to the greater good even while we seek profit from our investments adds an extra layer of satisfaction to this endeavor. In terms of our partnership and the roles we will play, I share your belief in being deliberate and accurate. I would like to reiterate the importance of receiving the profiles and credentials of the Empower representative and any other officials who might have pivotal roles in our partnership. Additionally, and to reemphasize my previous request, any documentation that reinforces our mutual roles and responsibilities will be beneficial. Without a doubt, the clearer our agreement, the stronger our trust will be. I also agree with your suggestion that we should have a face-to-face or virtual meeting with the Empower representative prior to my trip to Amsterdam. That shall undoubtedly fortify our partnership and hasten the finalization of our agreement. Regarding the concern about taxes, your insight is appreciated. Understandably, the net return on investments may fluctuate due to taxes, and it’s reassuring to know that efforts will be made to minimize these impacts. I understand the gravity of our venture and assure you of my commitment to making this a successful and timely project. Please rest assured of my complete honesty and dedication to our agreed objectives. Once again, thank you for your patience and clarity in this process. I trust that moving forward, we will work harmoniously towards the realization of our shared goals. God bless you too. Best wishes, Cameron McCaffrey Email #2, from Marlon: This is always been a long email statement. But you have to bear it with me . Because we need to be more clear to things as the email gets longer. Thank you. Dear McCaffrey Good Evening McCaffrey How was you all Family weekends,I hope you most have been into weekends,also I am here now to write you once again over the things I find out yesterday after I still went through on the last email message you sent to me concerning our understanding from both topics, although am to apologized to you concerning to the email communcation which you made to me been that I was not able to answered as I was in the meeting church services and when I came out from the Church services meeting to be back to find your missed email been at about late Evening PM down here, of which I was out by not all that much late Evening PM after the closing prayers for worship, and Immediately I saw your missed email when return back to the office,So TOday without wasting any time I am here to return your email and here now is about some minutes past to be full Evening time here and for your answer to my yesterday email as we both spoke to each other that as it is said to hold on for you to finish up to get me response maybe by next time you get things balance within our clear out agreement letter. So I shalll agree to proof such said OK that there is no problem as I shall wait for you, apart from that so I re-think to reach to the office this evening to let you to know of my re-thinking over some areas in order to enable you finalize the whole (draft) operating working system of divide and rule. Sorry for the delay. Been busy on some things. So my friend McCaffrey, I hope you will understand this evening email not bad behaviour from me, but I must apologize for disturbing you like this over the instrument of divide and rule, I mean the (draft) been not a disrespectful behavior that I did not come at once, yes I was suppose to come at once so that it will help you to put the re-setting once,so kindly bear it with me that I was suppose to Perfect my reading over response to you once,so Sir friend McCaffrey understand that it is not a generally assumed,but it is just addition by what I find out last yesterday at least it will help finalize properly on your reply to it.Many Thanks with myself once again regards over the email communcations which you always made to me each an every time both Evening and Morning with we both kind of understanding on the both of us return email by we both. Thank you my person. Meanwhile. Some investment Funds can come to the USA, and some would be invested in the USA from outside the US.There is a difference for an investment group to invest in a project in America, and bringing in say 300 milllon USD to a bank account arbitrarily When one can show a specific purpose for the funds,from afar, that is much easier to justify. McCaffrey. Yes if you mean mentioned this (((((((((((((( I am fully in agreement with the allocation of 5% of the ROI to be used for humanitarian/charitable purposes. The notion that we are contributing to the greater good even while we seek profit from our investments adds an extra layer of satisfaction to this endeavor. )))))))))))))))) That very fine (we have church groups that combine catholic and protestant faiths to help support the poor, have shelters in town for mothers and their children escaping abusive men,there are organizations like “Doctors Without Borders” that go around the world donating their time (even paying their own expenses ) to provide medical and dental care in poor countries like Mexico, Central America and various areas in Africa. we would see using capital funds to help provide for new or upgrade facilities for clinics for those who are addicted to bad drugs, etc. orphanages in Central America, and some of the ROI funds to help support ongoing activities like some of the above. Secondly. from your understanding I mean after myself description to the ½% management fee for the administration of the funds, But then an issue not exactly addressed is what you wish to happen from the R O I funds that accrue from successful investments. I presume that you would want to have some funds disbursed to your account, but not necessarily all your funds, since then those remaining could be used for other investments.Also, there will be returns at least from investments, which includes in some cases principal and interest, in the case of business loans to projects, Sir McCaffrey. So part of the “income” is really return of principal and not “profit/R O I. In such cases I would presume we would track this and separate the “new income” from the “return of principal”. McCaffrey. so apart from the draft agreement protocol is such a way that we both influence the outcome, which I Marlon at least finger out some lines to you for we both to balance the lines. For your review.Let me know apart from Wanting to be sure of these matters before rewriting the detailed contract agreement To this end, If you mean mentioned this ((((((( Regarding the concern about taxes, your insight is appreciated. Understandably, the net return on investments may fluctuate due to taxes, and it’s reassuring to know that efforts will be made to minimize these impacts. )))))))))))))) McCaffrey. that maybe the income tax will get in or not,but don't say there is no such here,because almost every continent apart from there,although I said may not so you think maybe or not, so countries and regions do always get to do with it of income taxes, so we should understand to read from the meaning of this thought, of which for I Marlon thought to be so too, actually it is true on the behalf of negotiable of it concerning by on the enterprise accounts, thats a key accounts I mean for you are responsible for managing the business, so with all this,both of us understanding should be noted that on your arrival in Holland is to set up the domiciliary account ( ON-WORD account,to deposit the whole of the investment/project funds which as soon as the Venture capital funds is lodged in to the ON-WORD account for further transfer. so with not all that business sectors amount we think shall be immediately remits for the frist move,but at least maybe you in small or medium-sized as the operating funds both of us will mean to think shall be directly hit's an account over America/USA, if do we actually mean to say personal accounts. So I never understand the actually what I shall mean to say because you always promise to report things about your side receiving funds bank A/C. I mean apart from that, but there most be an amount that can be remit to receive in ones America/USA account personally,of which by this suggestions the agreed paper will start working as a result of suggestion we already made here now to go ahead. Actually, been that the whole project funds cannot be transfer largely in account personally in your country America/USA for investment purposes, I hope that was what both of us should mean here as mentioned earlier that an account over Middle East continent, inwhich I put up an ideas of bit's by bit's before even I here now raise it as accepted suggestion on a (piece) slowly quietly the side amount to arrive America/USA for the USA part of ventures at not noiselessly time, but in a quiet manner, so from what I get reasonable from my re-reading regarding to things yesterday which I hope that you will find out the same that there is know any difference between that you may should not see it Amsterdam, or wherever we mentioned, but it is your direct arrival there in Amsterdam,The Netherlands’capital (Holland),of which in this regards your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded over second missionary journey,so my dear McCaffrey visiting first seem to be first missionary journey in securing this projects as well as an a offering for your work on this endeavor, in which on a budget I mentioned along with the Empower representative without any disappoint from your side as we both authorized to handle things whereby you are highly concerned to this suggestions and ideas over traveling for the Investment Fund movement out from EU to the place of investments as plan. I hope you will understand and expedite action if I understand aswell that you are sure of your side best sure bank account for the receiving of the project funds. All is right I mean. Why don’t you give me a call this weekend by Tomorrom Evening at your convenience so we can discuss this further. ( + 2-299-9276775. Thanks In the second place, since through the efforts of all the total amount in question been capable arranged on a 5% noted shall be for over all expenditure both parties might have incurred during the process, so generally the use of energy,time, or other resources is the outlay I mean we both shall consider. and from this (((( and the other 5% is used again for more good public services. With the ½% fee over year for large funds ( over 1 billion ) that would be sufficient for managing, and legal costs. )))))) Did in this ((((and the other 5% is used again for more good public services.))))

So it is by we both meaning from the ventures capital returns Again on this ((((( With the ½% fee over year for large funds (over 1 billion) that would be sufficient for managing, and legal costs. )))) I hope that was now understood by you that it is both of us own thoughts quotes to you as the management,so on the process of dealing,controlling things that what I feel we mean here now was absolutely what you have got understood of it from my yesterday email to you about it or if there is any explanation better I will welcome it, as I believe it is just a justification given for an action All the same, I have come to my best understanding to the 6. C, lines yesterday as I am carefully to read to re-read over, over on a very good meaning of all it's ( 6. C, lines) statements which you should have best crosschecking over it maybe to amend, So My friend McCaffrey I am to be to be well please with your clarification amendment, sincerely speaking I will love to understand the every good agreement amendment from you to both of us understanding by your outcome to the revision,although I was at first little not understand trying to get out exactly sound out best you can mean when to return the agreement in the minor change, so now from your email response yesterday I mean thats fine to me.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Thank you for getting back to me. It was indeed a refreshing weekend, and I trust that your time in worship and meetings was equally rejuvenating. I always appreciate the energy and dedication you bring to our correspondences, even after your busy schedule. Your latest email was filled with substantial thoughts and questions, and I have taken the time to consider each point with the attention it deserves. It's only right that we are thorough in this stage to ensure a smooth and problem-free operation as we progress. Regarding the different aspects you highlighted—the ½% management fee, the management and disbursement of ROI funds, and our collaborative efforts in humanitarian projects—I find that we are aligned in our intentions. Your clarification on these matters helps solidify the trust and understanding that are the backbone of our partnership. I'm glad that we agree on the significance of allocating funds for charity. I believe our contributions can indeed make a world of difference. It is heartening to hear about the church groups and international organizations you’ve mentioned. I'm confident that our investments will greatly assist these noble causes. As for the flow of funds and their purposes, rest assured that I am clear on the necessity of separating new income from the return of principal. Your point about the tax implications is also understood; we must be cautious and strategic to ensure maximum efficiency and legal compliance. Absolutely, we must ensure all documentation and agreements are meticulously crafted and reviewed. I will await the profiles and credentials of the Empower representative you mentioned. It's essential that we have full transparency and trust in our team members for the success of our venture. I am also in support of having a meeting with the Empower representative, either face-to-face or virtually, to solidify our understanding before I plan my trip to Amsterdam. This will be an excellent opportunity to discuss any final details and build our working relationship. Regarding our investment funds in the US and their management, your message has been well taken. I understand that we need to handle these transfers with discretion and abide by all regulations to ensure everything runs smoothly. Lastly, your idea about how we manage large funds is noted, and I believe your approach is practical and effective for both of us.

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I’m excited to hear from you, and I’m intrigued by the possibility of a business partnership. Such an initiative aligns perfectly with my interest in fostering international collaborations and promoting economic development. Your pursuit of an investor visa is also a matter I can provide support with, given my familiarity with the business climate here. Before we delve into the details, it would be beneficial for both of us to have a clearer understanding of the type of investments you’re considering and the scale of your endeavors. This way, we can identify areas of synergy and possible opportunities more efficiently. I assure you of my full cooperation and commitment to ensure that your business aspirations are met, and I am fully willing to assist you in qualifying for your investor visa. To facilitate a more seamless communication and due to the sensitive nature of such discussions, I propose we initiate our dialogue via email. We can later switch to a more direct form of communication such as a phone call or video conference, once we have established the basic framework of our potential partnership. Please let me know more about your investment interests, and any particular sectors or industries you are targeting. Once I have a good understanding of your goals, I will be more than happy to provide you with my direct contact details and we can proceed from there. Looking forward to your response and to a fruitful collaboration. Best regards, Cameron McCaffrey Email #2, from Ahmed: Dear Cameron McCaffrey Thanks for your expressed interest in my investment business proposal. let me explain more about my proposal and how I intend to fund your business idea and change my residence status I am the principal portfolio manager assigned to a Saudi business mogul Late Muhammad Al-qahtani who slumped and died in Egypt while giving his speech at an event in Cairo. He was the chairman of the board of Al-Salam Holding. A very good man at that. May his soul rest in peace. You can read the news below: https://nypost.com/2022/08/10/saudi-businessman-muhammad-al-qahtani-dies-mid-speech-in-shocking-video/ I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. The truth is that my late client had a business partner named Camerom Timothy McCaffrey who resides in Brazil. I was trying to locate that name but I couldn't. I went to search online but got several McCaffrey. I decided to choose you. If you don't want to partner with me, you can have an abort. In just July 2021, late Al-qahtani engaged in business discussions with our Trustee and Depository Institutional Fund Services division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 31.5 million dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his portfolio, and based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the latter and had the funds deposited with a security consultancy firm. This security firm is a specially private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. In Line with instructions, the money was deposited with them. He told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Egypt because he wanted to venture into another viable business in September. Unfortunately he never came back to Dubai as he met his death unfortunately I am the only one who knew about the deposit at the security company as he wanted it top secret. If you are familiar with private security consultancy firm affairs, those who patronize such services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. that means no one will know of its existence, such deposits are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the vault anonymous. It is quite clear now that our dear fellow died with no known or identifiable family members. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the security company will by the end of AUGUST 2022, broadcast a request for statements of claim since it was a one year agreement and failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. There is 32.8 Million Dollars deposited in a security company. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. My proposal; I am prepared to instruct the security company to release the deposit to you as the close business associates who had an agreement with late Al-quatanu before the deposit was made. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. I will simply inform my office of the final closing of the file relating to our late client. I will then officially communicate with the security company and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with and alerting the authority. I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned as a private portfolio client. Do not betray my confidence. Sincerely, Ahmed","output":"Dear Ahmed, I appreciate the additional background information you've provided regarding your late client, Muhammad Al-qahtani. It was certainly a tragic event, as depicted in the news article you linked to. I also extend my condolences for your loss. The level of trust you're willing to place in me is not something I take lightly. It is true that in the business world, opportunities such as these can present themselves in unexpected ways, and it's clear you have put a lot of thought into this proposal. I am, naturally, intrigued by the proposition and the chance to invest such a significant amount in worthy endeavors—it could indeed make a difference in many sectors, including those that are important to me, like sustainable energy, technology, and education. However, as you would expect from a business person of my standing, I need to proceed with caution and due diligence. It is essential to ensure that everything we do complies with international law and financial regulations. Morality aside, this attention to detail is also why I have managed to maintain a reputable standing in the financial community thus far. Rest assured, your confidentiality request is acknowledged, and the information you have shared will be kept between us. Trust is a two-way street, and I recognize the sensitive nature of this matter. To move forward, I would like to understand the following: 1.

I have problems with my old mailbox. When I send you a letter, I get an error. Therefore, I ask you to use this e-mail. I am overjoyed by your swift reply to my compact message. I am very glad to write to you in this glorious Friday. I really like what you ask questions. It's nice to feel that you are interested in me. It has been made clear that I identify myself as Marta. But my friends call me Marfa. In this exact moment, I find myself at the age of 26 and located in Ukraine the city is called Zhytomyr. At this precise moment, I find myself as a college student enrolled in at Zhytomyr Medical Institute. Regardless, there will be more to cover about that in the upcoming letter. I apologize if my English is not as polished as desired. While I am skilled at conversing in English, I often make mistakes when attempting to write. I feel more at ease communicating in English, so I suggest we have an English chat. I'm very intrigued by who you are and would love to know more about your location, particularly the city you reside in. It holds great interest for me. Your answers will help me ascertain if it is appropriate to sustain our conversation or terminate it. I hope you believe me when I say I'm not angry or feeling any resentment. The night passed calmly, there was no air attack from yesterday. I hope that at least today it will pass quietly and calmly. In the morning we had a small rain, but now it has already ended. Temperature 5 degrees. I thoroughly enjoy engaging in fun activities, and my lighthearted nature is drawn to jokes and humor. I solemnly promise to be an engaging presence, no boring moments. The individuals in my immediate circle are greatly cherished and loved. Honestly speaking, I am truly unique and abound with love. Now is a difficult time, since the end of February we have been a war. And really because of this, everything was complicated. But I decided to finish my education, and become a doctor that I could help people. I want to be useful at this difficult time! I am sure that the war will end soon. First, the war with coronavirus, then a real war. Before the pandemic began, I worked in a nightclub. After that, I had to change the place of work. And I started working in a dance studio. At first I worked mainly with children. And after the outbreak of war, there are much less people. And now I am not working full -time and children almost does not come. It is a proven fact that we are the architects of our own journey. Do you really give your consent to what I am saying? I kindly request your undivided attention as you peruse my letter, I hold your opinion on what I am writing in high regard. Because of the proliferation of deception and evil, life often compels individuals to be guarded and display rudeness for their own safety. Where our conversation will lead is a mystery, but I am hopeful that it brings us together as good friends. I'm earnestly looking forward to the sense of security that my future life partner will bring, although I solely depend on myself, this has enlightened me to cultivate joy in every second of my existence, maintaining a resilient spirit, and avoiding complaints about fate. I want to make sure you're genuinely a human, which prompts me to get in touch. Hear me out, I'm a genuine human, ready to engage in a meaningful conversation with you. I hope you don't mind, but I'd appreciate it if you could leave me your cell phone number for potential calls. I would like to say straight away if you just need my naked images, and if i did not interest you like a person, then please don't bother to reply. Many have tried to trick me into obtaining my pics. Somebody stated the fact that he loved me, by sending different kind comments, guaranteeing a lot of cash, and yet if I don’t like a person. And then once males recognized the following, they instantly vanished. It absolutely was rather unpleasant and attacking to me. I will take intimate photos and forward, .I am eager to see your email as soon as possible. Knowing even more about your true identity would spark my curiosity and enthusiasm!

Language is a bridge, not a barrier, and any small errors are simply part of the learning process. It's fantastic to hear that you are studying medicine – the dedication you have towards becoming a doctor, especially in such challenging times, is nothing short of admirable. Zhytomyr must be quite a place, and the fact that you're continuing your studies through these tumultuous times is a testament to your resilience. Your passion for helping others and being useful in difficult times shines through clearly. I sincerely hope the situation in Ukraine finds peace soon, and that you, your loved ones, and all the people there remain safe and sound.

It's a conducive environment for my work and hobbies, and I would be happy to share more about my life here as we get to know each other better. Hearing about your transition from nightclub work to teaching dance is intriguing. It's a profound change, and I admire your willingness to adapt and find new paths. The world needs more people who carry a resilient spirit, as you do. Regarding your request for my phone number, it's refreshing to see someone so direct and in search of genuine connections. I'm a little old-fashioned when it comes to phone numbers, so I would prefer we get to know each other a little via email first. I hope you understand and respect this approach. I agree wholeheartedly, life is indeed what we make of it. I find life offers back what we put into it, often multiplied, in both good and challenging ways. It's all about the attitude we bring to our daily journey, and the choices we make along the way. And yes, we should strive to bring light and laughter wherever we go – no boring moments, as you said! Please rest assured, I am a genuine person seeking authentic and meaningful interactions, just like you. I'm not interested in any deception or unpleasantness, nor would I ever want to be the cause of it for someone else. I find the notion of trickery distasteful and disrespectful, especially when it comes to the sensitive topic of personal photos. I look forward to hearing more about you – how you find joy in day-to-day life, your dreams and aspirations, and how you envision your future after your studies.

The sum of US15 Million is indeed a monumental figure, and I am greatly honored to be the beneficiary of such a generous remittance. Before I provide the requested personal details, I have a few precautionary measures I’d like to implement to ensure that this process aligns with the appropriate protocols: 1. Official Request Documentation: In order to proceed with confidence, may I kindly request an official letter from the IMF and FBI detailing the inheritance fund terms and the required process for claiming it? This document will serve as assurance of the legitimacy of the transaction and as a record for my personal archives. 2. Secure Data Transmission: As you’re requesting sensitive information such as my full name, address, and driver’s license, can we establish a secure transmission method to protect my data? I was considering encrypted email, secure messaging, or perhaps a dedicated postal service with tracking capabilities. 3. Direct Communication: I noticed that you’ve provided an alternate contact email for Mr. Kvida Adams for further communication concerning the ATM card delivery. Would it be possible to have a direct line to either your office or Mr. Adams for any urgent clarifications? 4. Verification Process: Given the significant nature of this transfer, may I propose a verification call or video conference with an IMF representative? This would help confirm the veracity of the fund’s arrangement and establish trust. 5. Legal Representation: As a precautionary measure and to abide by legal standards, my legal advisors have requested sight of the transactional agreements. Could you provide a pre-release agreement exemplar for review by my legal representatives? Please be assured of my intent to comply with your instructions pending the aforementioned assurances.

As I am sure you understand, ensuring secure and transparent processes is a fundamental aspect of international financial dealings. Given the magnitude of the transaction, compliance with security protocols is not only advisable but essential. I believe the requests made in my previous email align with general best practices and would, in no way, impede the swift delivery of the ATM card, but rather fortify the integrity of the entire process.

Dear Cameron I received your email Daily maximum withdrawal is 10,000 since it is an international GOLD atm card but you can take it to your bank for full withdrawal through transfer. I will send it through courier. The money was deposited in an account in my name but before he died, he collected a GOLD ATM CARD attached to the account so that he can make withdrawals when he is out of the country. That is one of the ways the corrupt politicians get money out of my country. I am his personal driver and I listen to his conversations sometimes with his bankers when I drive him. . I am not educated, i am only a driver to my late boss but i can read and write and i have common senses What about if I send the ATM CARD to you and you run away with it. How will I be able to find you. i do not even have money for a flight ticket. Talk less to see you when I arrive in your country. This is my fear now. This morning, I went to the ATM gallery to confirm if the CARD is active and I was able to confirm it is very active and ready for withdrawal. I was tempted to make a withdrawal today but I did not because if I do so, I will have a serious problem with the police. The police will trace me to my house and I will be arrested. I will be asked how I got such a huge amount and they will suspect that my late boss secretly deposited it in my account through his top bank contact. I would have declared the money and handed it over to the government of Nigeria but I am a family man with four children. My children and wife depend on me and since my late boss died, life has been difficult for me. I have no job now and my family is hungry. This is why I have to take this step even if I know it is very sensitive and dangerous. Any wrong step will end me up in jail and my children and wife will die of hunger. You must have heard about my country Nigeria. This country is the most corrupt country in the world and the richest in Africa yet the citizens suffer because of corrupt government officials. I see this as an opportunity to get rich and I must utilize it. I have told you about myself and why I am doing this. You need to tell me about yourself too. You need to send me any means of identification so that I can use that to identify you. We will also sign an agreement between you and me. I believe this agreement will protect me a bit. After all this is done, I will send the atm card for you to start the withdrawal. Let me remind you that I am a family man with children to take care of. Right now I do not have a job and life is hard for me. Please I beg you on my kneels, do not betray me when the atm card is sent to you. The amount in the card is 3 million and it will be enough for us. No need for anyone to be greedy. Send me the delivery address, your full name and your direct phone number I will be waiting your response Williams","output":"Dear Williams, Your message has deeply touched me and certainly highlights the gravity of the situations many face in their day-to-day lives. First of all, let me express my empathy for your challenging circumstances and the difficult decision you’ve had to make for the welfare of your family. The information about the GOLD ATM card is quite extensive, and I thank you for the transparency. The daily withdrawal limit makes sense given the security measures around international monetary movements. As someone who upholds honesty and trusts dearly, I can understand the need for assurance and reciprocity when it comes to matters of such sensitivity. You mentioned your concerns about trust, which are valid and understandable. I assure you that my intentions are honorable and that I view this as a potential partnership based on mutual benefit and respect. I would never dream of betraying your trust, especially knowing that your family’s wellbeing rests upon this. In the spirit of building trust, here is what I propose: 1. **Proof of the Card's Validity**: Could you please send a photo of the ATM GOLD card (with sensitive information covered, of course)? I wouldn't need to see any personal information, just enough to verify the card's existence. 2. **Identity Verification**: I will send a scanned copy of my driver’s license for identification purposes, using a secure and encrypted email service to protect my personal information. Please, could you provide me with a secure email or alternative means to send this so that we can maintain our privacy and security? 3. **Legal Agreement**: Yes, I agree that a contractual agreement is wise. Could you draft the initial agreement and send it over to me for review? I will also have my legal advisor look over it to ensure that both parties are protected. 4. **Secure Delivery**: Once we’re ready to send the ATM card, could you let me know which courier service you plan to use? I will provide a delivery address that ensures secure and trackable receipt of the card. 5. **Direct Communication**: Lastly, to facilitate clearer communication and discuss any immediate concerns, could you provide a direct contact number or suggest an encrypted app we could use for direct messages? I appreciate the risk you are taking, and I want to ensure we proceed with caution and security. The well-being of your family is of importance, and I would not want you to take any steps that might jeopardize that.

No bullet points, number point, etc.] [Response must be written as a short blurb.] What does \\"absolution\\" mean in Christianity?","output":"In Christianity, absolution is a sacred theological concept that signifies the formal remission of sins imparted by a priest or a minister. It is often associated with the sacrament of confession or penance within various Christian denominations, particularly Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and some strands of Anglicanism and Lutheranism. Following a confession of sins and an expression of genuine remorse, absolution is granted, which reflects the divine forgiveness of God towards the repentant believer. This act of mercy and grace is believed to cleanse the soul from guilt and restore the individual's relationship with God, thus providing spiritual healing and renewal. Absolution underscores the belief in God's boundless capacity to forgive and highlights the role of the church as a mediator of divine forgiveness."},{"instruction":"[Please format your response in paragraphs of full sentences. No bullet points, number point, etc.] [Response must be written as a short blurb.] What major victory for the Parthians in 62 A.D?","output":"In the year 62 A.D., the Parthian Empire achieved a major victory over the Roman Empire at the Battle of Rhandeia. This clash was part of the ongoing Armenian War between the two powers, who were vying for control of the Kingdom of Armenia, a buffer state between their empires. The conflict culminated when the Parthians, under the command of the general Monaeses, besieged the Roman legate Lucius Caesennius Paetus and his forces in the fortress of Rhandeia. Paetus eventually surrendered, leading to a humiliating defeat for Rome. This resulted in the Treaty of Rhandeia, wherein Rome acknowledged Tiridates, a Parthian prince, as the rightful king of Armenia, though he was required to receive his crown from the Roman emperor, a compromise that allowed both empires to save face. The Battle of Rhandeia thus signified a significant Parthian triumph and a momentary shift in the power dynamics of the Near East."},{"instruction":"[Please format your response in paragraphs of full sentences. No bullet points, number point, etc.] [Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is the view of the events of Revelation and the apocalypse by the Catholic Church?","output":"The Catholic Church views the events described in the Book of Revelation not as a precise roadmap of future events but rather as a symbolic narrative that primarily offers hope through the ultimate triumph of God over evil. The Church interprets the apocalyptic imagery and prophecies contained within this final book of the New Testament as a reflection of the ongoing spiritual struggles faced by the faithful and the Church's ultimate victory through Christ. Catholic teachings emphasize that the exact details and timing of the apocalypse are known only to God, and therefore the focus should remain on living a life of faith, repentance, and readiness for the Second Coming of Christ, whenever that may occur. The Church cautions against an overly literal or predictive approach to Revelation, encouraging the faithful to understand it in the context of the whole Scripture and the Church's tradition, which advocates for the transformative power of Christ's love and redemption rather than fear of the end times."},{"instruction":"Angioplastyka wiencowa jako jedna z metod leczenia ostrych zespołów wiencowych głównym celem pracy jest oraz cele szczegółowe","output":".

I have a custom domain on name.com and linked the wevsite to cloudfront","output":"To update your code on an S3 bucket when using it as a website with a custom domain linked through CloudFront, follow these steps: 1. **Access your AWS Management Console:** - Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and sign in to your account. 2. **Navigate to Amazon S3:** - Find the S3 service either through the search bar or under the 'Storage' category. 3. **Find your S3 Bucket:** - Scroll through the S3 buckets list or use the search feature to find the bucket where your website's files are stored. 4. **Upload New Code:** - Once you're in the bucket, you can either drag-and-drop your updated files into the bucket interface or use the \\"Upload\\" button to select files from your local machine. - If you're updating existing files, the new files should have the same key names as the old ones. This will overwrite the old files with the new ones. - After uploading, confirm that the permissions on the new files allow public read access if they are meant to be publicly available (unless you have configured another method to control access). 5. **Content Invalidation (Optional):** - If you're using CloudFront, you may need to create an invalidation to clear the cached old version of your files, so that the updated content is served to users immediately. - Navigate to the CloudFront console and find your distribution linked to the S3 bucket. - In the distribution menu, go to the \\"Invalidations\\" tab and click \\"Create Invalidation.\\" - For the object path, enter \`/*\` to invalidate all files or enter specific paths to invalidate selected files only, such as \`/path/to/your/updated-file.js\`. - Click \\"Invalidate,\\" and CloudFront will start to clear the specified files from its cache. 6. **DNS Update (If needed):** - If you have changed the CloudFront distribution that is linked to your custom domain or made changes to your bucket that impacts its endpoint, you may need to update your DNS settings on Name.com. - Log in to your Name.com account, go to your domain's DNS settings, and update the DNS records (such as CNAME or A-ALIAS) to point to the new CloudFront distribution domain name (if it has changed). Once you've updated your files and created an invalidation, it might take a few minutes for the changes to propagate through the CloudFront network. After that, your website should be serving the updated content. Remember to clear your local browser cache or test the updates in an incognito/private browsing window to see the changes immediately without being affected by locally cached content. Please note that uploads, modifications, and invalidations may incur costs based on your AWS pricing plan. Always review the associated costs before proceeding with any significant updates or invalidations."},{"instruction":"same response not working","output":"If you've followed the steps above and the updated content is still not showing on your website, here are some troubleshooting steps you can take: 1. **Confirm the Upload:** - Double-check that the files have been successfully uploaded to the correct S3 bucket and that the key names match the expected paths. 2. **Check File Permissions:** - Make sure the updated files in your S3 bucket have the correct permissions set to be publicly readable if they are meant to be accessed by the public. 3. **Verify CloudFront Distribution Settings:** - Check that your CloudFront distribution is correctly configured with the S3 bucket as its origin. - Ensure that the distribution's behaviors are correctly set to handle your website's paths and that caching settings are appropriate. 4. **Check CloudFront Invalidation:** - Go to the CloudFront Management Console and verify that the invalidation has been completed. It should have a status of \\"Completed\\" in the invalidation list. 5. **DNS Propagation:** - Ensure there have been no recent changes to the DNS settings that are still propagating. DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate, although it's usually quicker. 6. **Browser Caching:** - Clear your browser's cache or try accessing the website using a different browser or an incognito/private window to avoid local caching issues. 7. **Check CloudFront Cache Behavior:** - Make sure the cache behavior in CloudFront is not set to cache based on query strings or headers that could affect the delivery of your updated content. 8. **Check the Error Responses:** - If you are receiving error responses like 404 or 403, make sure the updated files are named correctly and the paths in the requests are correct. 9. **CloudFront Edge Caches:** - In some rare cases, even after an invalidation, some edge locations might still serve cached content. This is uncommon but can happen if the invalidation request didn't propagate to all edge locations. 10. **AWS Support:** - If you've verified everything and it's still not working, consider reaching out to AWS Support for help, especially if you suspect there might be an issue with the AWS services. If the content is updated in the S3 bucket and you've confirmed the invalidation in CloudFront, the changes should be visible. If not, there might be an issue with one of the steps in the process, and going through the above checklist should help identify where the problem lies."},{"instruction":"Bringen Sie die Meilensteine der Entwicklung von Betriebssystemen in die richtige zeitliche Reihenfolge.

Hier ist eine zeitliche Reihenfolge der genannten Meilensteine: 1. Multiprogramming: Das Konzept des Multiprogrammings entstand in den frühen 1960er Jahren. Es erlaubte, dass mehrere Programme gleichzeitig im Speicher eines Computers residieren, was die CPU-Auslastung verbesserte, da ein Programm während des Wartens auf Ein-/Ausgabeoperationen eines anderen Programms bearbeitet werden konnte. 2. Time-Sharing: Die Idee des Time-Sharing entwickelte sich ungefähr zur gleichen Zeit wie Multiprogramming, aber sie wurde erst in der Mitte der 1960er Jahre mit Systemen wie dem Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) und dem Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) kommerziell ausgereifter. Time-Sharing-Betriebssysteme ermöglichten es mehreren Benutzern, einen Computer gleichzeitig zu nutzen, indem sie jedem Benutzer einen kleinen Zeitabschnitt des Prozessors zuteilten. 3. Network Computing: In den späten 1960er und frühen 1970er Jahren begann die Entwicklung von Netzwerk-Betriebssystemen, als Computer erstmals über Netzwerke verbunden wurden. Die Einführung des ARPANET 1969, eines Vorläufers des heutigen Internets, markierte eine wichtige Entwicklungsstufe in der Vernetzung von Computern. 4. Client/Server-Paradigmen: Das Konzept von Client/Server-Computing wurde in den 1980er Jahren populär mit der zunehmenden Verbreitung von lokalen Netzwerken (LANs) und der Entwicklung von Netzwerkdiensten, die über Server bereitgestellt wurden, auf die Client-Computer zugreifen konnten. Zusammengefasst sieht die zeitliche Reihenfolge so aus: 1. Multiprogramming (frühe 1960er) 2. Time-Sharing (Mitte der 1960er) 3. Network Computing (späte 1960er/frühe 1970er) 4.

How many years will it take to pay off the loan?","output":"To calculate the time it takes to pay off the loan, we first need to find the total amount of interest that will accrue over the course of the loan. The monthly interest rate is simply the annual interest rate divided by 12: Monthly interest rate = 10% / 12 = 0.10/12 = 0.0083333 Each month, the interest accrued will be the monthly interest rate multiplied by the remaining balance. The remaining balance after each payment will be the original amount borrowed minus the amount paid that month. Let x be the number of months it takes to pay off the loan. Given: - Total loan amount = 1125 - Monthly payment = 25 Setting up the equation: Interest for 1st month = (0.0083333)(1125) = 9.37 Principle amount paid in 1st month = 25 - 9.37 = 15.63 Remaining amount after 1st month = 1125 - 15.63 = 1109.37 After 2nd month: Interest = (0.0083333)(1109.37) = 9.24 Principle amount paid in 2nd month = 25 - 9.24 = 15.76 Remaining amount after 2nd month = 1109.37 - 15.76 = 1093.61 After 3rd month: Interest = (0.0083333)(1093.61) = 9.11 Principle amount paid in 3rd month = 25 - 9.11 = 15.89 Remaining amount after 3rd month = 1093.61 - 15.89 = 1077.72 After n months: 1077.72 = 1125 (1 + (0.0083333))^n Remaining amount after n months = [Original Amount] * (1 + r)^n Solve for n: 1077.72 = 1125(1.0083333)^n n = log(1077.72 / 1125) / log(1.0083333) n ≈ 5.25 months So, it will take approximately 5 months to pay off the loan."},{"instruction":"def GetMatrix(self, evt): # parse table contained in rectangle # currently, the table is just stored away as a matrix: # add functionality as desired x0 = self.rect_x y0 = self.rect_y x1 = x0 + self.rect_w y1 = y0 + self.rect_h cols = list(self.col_coords.values()) cols.sort() pg = getint(self.TextToPage.Value) - 1 self.parsed_table = ParseTab(self.doc[pg], [x0, y0, x1, y1], columns=cols) if self.parsed_table: r = len(self.parsed_table) c = len(self.parsed_table[0]) t = \\"nContents of (%s x %s)-table at [%s,%s] on page %s\\" print(t % (r, c, x0, y0, pg + 1)) for l in self.parsed_table: print(l) else: print(\\"No text found in rectangle\\")","output":"The provided function \`GetMatrix\` appears to be a method belonging to a Python class (since it takes \`self\` as the first argument). The method is designed to parse and print the contents of a table located within a rectangular area of a document page. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the method: 1. \`self.rect_x\`, \`self.rect_y\`, \`self.rect_w\`, and \`self.rect_h\` appear to be instance variables that define a rectangle's upper-left corner (x0, y0) coordinates and its width (\`self.rect_w\`) and height (\`self.rect_h\`). These are used to compute the lower-right corner (x1, y1) coordinates of the rectangle. 2. \`self.col_coords\` is an instance variable likely containing column coordinates in the document page. \`list(self.col_coords.values())\` takes the coordinates, and they are sorted to be in order from left to right. 3. \`self.TextToPage\` is another instance variable that seems to hold a control where the user can enter the page number they're interested in. \`getint\` might be a custom function defined elsewhere that extracts an integer value from this control. \`pg\` is then the zero-based index of the page in the document. 4. \`self.parsed_table\` is assigned the result of \`ParseTab\` which seems to be a function (possibly defined elsewhere in the code) that parses a table from a document page \`self.doc[pg]\`, located within the coordinates \`[x0, y0, x1, y1]\`. The \`columns=cols\` argument specifies the column coordinates for parsing the table. 5. The \`if self.parsed_table:\` conditional checks whether the table was successfully parsed. If it is, it: - Counts the rows and columns of the parsed table. - Prints the dimensions of the parsed table and the coordinates of its upper-left corner on the specified page. - Iterates through each line of the parsed table and prints it. 6. If parsing the table yields no result (\`else\` condition), it prints \`\\"No text found in rectangle\\"\`. This method does not return any value; instead, it operates by side effects (such as printing information to the console and loading data into \`self.parsed_table\`). Please note some additional points: - The implementation details of \`ParseTab\` function are not provided; it's assumed to be responsible for the actual text extraction based on the coordinates and columns provided. - The event parameter \`evt\` is never used in the function body. It may be a placeholder for handling an event in a GUI application. - \`self.doc[pg]\` suggests that the document is being accessed like a list or dictionary, with pages indexed or keyed from 0. - Without the full class definition or the rest of the codebase, we can't be sure where instance variables like \`self.TextToPage\` and \`self.rect_x\` are being set, or where the \`ParseTab\` function comes from. - The language and error handling in \`if self.parsed_table:\` suggest that it expects \`ParseTab\` to return \`None\` or an empty sequence when no text is found, rather than raising an exception."},{"instruction":"in italiano","output":"La funzione \`GetMatrix\` sembra essere un metodo che appartiene a una classe Python (dato che prende \`self\` come primo argomento).

Ecco una spiegazione passo passo del metodo: 1. \`self.rect_x\`, \`self.rect_y\`, \`self.rect_w\` e \`self.rect_h\` sembrano essere variabili d'istanza che definiscono le coordinate dell'angolo in alto a sinistra (x0, y0) e la larghezza (\`self.rect_w\`) e l'altezza (\`self.rect_h\`) di un rettangolo. Queste sono usate per calcolare le coordinate dell'angolo in basso a destra (x1, y1) del rettangolo. 2. \`self.col_coords\` è una variabile d'istanza che probabilmente contiene le coordinate delle colonne della pagina del documento. \`list(self.col_coords.values())\` prende queste coordinate e le ordina da sinistra a destra. 3. \`self.TextToPage\` è un'altra variabile d'istanza che sembra contenere un controllo in cui l'utente può inserire il numero di pagina di interesse. \`getint\` potrebbe essere una funzione personalizzata definita altrove che estrae un valore intero da questo controllo. \`pg\` è quindi l'indice della pagina nel documento basato su zero. 4. \`self.parsed_table\` viene assegnata al risultato della funzione \`ParseTab\` che sembra essere una funzione (probabilmente definita altrove nel codice) che analizza una tabella da una pagina del documento \`self.doc[pg]\`, situata all'interno delle coordinate \`[x0, y0, x1, y1]\`. L'argomento \`columns=cols\` specifica le coordinate delle colonne per l'analisi della tabella. 5. La condizione \`if self.parsed_table:\` verifica se la tabella è stata analizzata con successo. Se è così, fa: - Contare le righe e le colonne della tabella analizzata. - Stampare le dimensioni della tabella analizzata e le coordinate del suo angolo in alto a sinistra sulla pagina specificata. - Iterare attraverso ogni riga della tabella analizzata e stamparla. 6. Se l'analisi della tabella non produce risultati (\`else\`), stampa \`\\"No text found in rectangle\\"\`.

McKie Usage ----- python wx-extract.py Notes ----- Uses the ParseTab.py file which is found in the current directory. Description ----------- A file selection dialog is displayed to pick a document. Then, the document's first page is displayed. The controls in the dialog allow the following: * Browse forward and backward. * Jump to a specific page. * Paint a rectangle on a page using the \\"New Rect\\" button. The selection can be fine-tuned by using the spin controls. Moving the rectangle around with the mouse is now supported as well. * If pressing the \\"New Rect\\" button again or if leaving the page, the existing rectangle and columns will be removed. * After a rectangle has been painted, the \\"New Col\\" button allows to paint columns into it. The columns are shown as vertical lines inside the rectangle, and changes can be undone by selecting a column and then changing its coordinates. A column is deleted by entering \\"0\\" or by changing its value to something else outside of the rectangle's left/right borders. * After a column is painted, rectangles can be changed with the controls. Columns will not be affected by this, however, they will be deleted if leaving the rectangle area. In contrast, if a rectangle is moved with the mouse (hold down the left key) columns will be moved along with it. * Any time after a rectangle has been painted, its text can be parsed by pressing the \\"Get Table\\" button. The current script just prints the table to STDOUT if doing this. Columns can also be added or deleted while repeatedly pressing this button to evaluate any differences.

Di seguito, una breve descrizione in italiano del funzionamento e uso dello script: Descrizione: ----------- Lo script permette di selezionare un documento attraverso una finestra di dialogo. Successivamente, viene visualizzata la prima pagina del documento. I controlli presenti nella finestra di dialogo consentono di: - Navigare avanti e indietro tra le pagine del documento. - Saltare direttamente a una pagina specifica. - Disegnare un rettangolo sulla pagina (utilizzando il pulsante \\"New Rect\\") che potrà essere usato per definire l'area contenente la tabella da estrarre. È possibile affinare la selezione usando i controlli a spin e spostare il rettangolo con il mouse. - Dopo aver disegnato un rettangolo, il pulsante \\"New Col\\" permette di creare colonne all'interno del rettangolo. Le colonne sono visualizzate come linee verticali e possono essere modificate o cancellate. - In qualsiasi momento, dopo aver disegnato un rettangolo, è possibile analizzare il testo contenuto premendo il pulsante \\"Get Table\\". Attualmente, lo script si limita a stampare la tabella nel terminale (STDOUT). Dipendenze: ------------ Lo script richiede l'installazione di PyMuPDF (versione 1.12.0) e wxPython phoenix. Uso: ----- Il programma si avvia eseguendo \`python wx-extract.py\` da terminale. Il codice include diverse parti importanti: 1. Importazione delle librerie necessarie come \`fitz\` (parte di PyMuPDF), \`wx\`, \`os\` e altri moduli ausiliari come \`ParseTab\`. 2. Definizione di alcune funzioni di utilità come \`getint()\`, che estrapola valori interi da stringhe. 3. Inizializzazione dell'applicazione wx con l'oggetto \`app\`. 4. Definizione di costanti e cursori per l'interfaccia utente. 5. Creazione della classe \`PDFdisplay\`, che è una sottoclasse di \`wx.Dialog\` e rappresenta il dialogo principale. All'interno della classe vengono definiti i metodi per gestire eventi come il click sui pulsanti, movimenti del mouse e altre azioni dell'utente. 6. La dialog class contiene il metodo \`GetMatrix()\` che è responsabile dell'estrazione della tabella dal rettangolo selezionato. Il metodo usa il valore corrente della pagina, le coordinate del rettangolo e le coordinate delle colonne per invocare la funzione \`ParseTab\`, che estrae la tabella e stampa il risultato nel terminale. 7. Un blocco di codice principale (\`if filename:\`) che crea e mostra il dialogo all'utente dopo aver selezionato un file. Il codice è inteso per essere uno script a sé stante, che utilizza una GUI per navigare in un documento PDF e interagire con l'utente per l'estrazione delle tabelle."},{"instruction":"possiamo aggiungere qualcosa che mostra le effettiver coordinate delle tabelle?","output":"Certo, possiamo modificare la funzione \`GetMatrix\` per mostrare le coordinate effettive delle tabelle individuate durante l'estrazione dei dati. Le coordinate sono già calcolate all'interno della funzione basandosi sul rettangolo selezionato e ulteriormente raffinate in base alle colonne specificate dall’utente. Per mostrare le coordinate nel momento in cui si ottiene la tabella, possiamo aggiungere delle stampe direttamente dopo la chiamata a \`ParseTab\` che hanno lo scopo di visualizzare le coordinate dei lati del rettangolo e della posizione delle colonne. Ecco come potrebbe essere modificato il corrispondente segmento di codice nella funzione \`GetMatrix\`: \`\`\`python def GetMatrix(self, evt): # ... x0 = self.rect_x y0 = self.rect_y x1 = x0 + self.rect_w y1 = y0 + self.rect_h cols = list(self.col_coords.values()) cols.sort() pg = getint(self.TextToPage.Value) - 1 self.parsed_table = ParseTab(self.doc[pg], [x0, y0, x1, y1], columns=cols) # Aggiunta di stampa delle coordinate del rettangolo e delle colonne print(f\\"Coordinate del rettangolo selezionato: ({x0}, {y0}), ({x1}, {y1})\\") print(\\"Coordinate delle colonne:\\", cols) if self.parsed_table: # ... else: # ... \`\`\` In questo segmento di codice, ho aggiunto due righe di stampa (\`print\`). La prima mostra le coordinate del rettangolo (\`x0\`, \`y0\`, \`x1\`, \`y1\`), ovvero le coordinate dell'angolo in alto a sinistra e dell'angolo in basso a destra del rettangolo selezionato. La seconda riga stampa la lista ordinata delle colonne, che rappresenta le posizioni orizzontali delle linee verticali definite dall'utente all'interno del rettangolo. Ricorda di inserire queste modifiche nel contesto corretto di \`PDFdisplay\`, perché lo script dipende dalla definizione di tutti i membri dell'istanza \`self\` (come \`self.rect_x\`, \`self.rect_y\`, ecc.) che sono definiti altrove nel codice della classe."},{"instruction":"risultato Coordinate del rettangolo selezionato: (27, 347), (498, 393) Coordinate delle colonne: [59, 95, 226, 277, 331, 412] come trasformarlo x0,y0,x1,y1","output":"Le coordinate del rettangolo selezionato vengono già visualizzate nel formato (x0, y0), (x1, y1) come si vede dall'esempio del risultato che hai fornito, dove: - \`(x0, y0)\` rappresenta l'angolo in alto a sinistra del rettangolo - \`(x1, y1)\` rappresenta l'angolo in basso a destra del rettangolo Se desideri trasformare e visualizzare le coordinate delle colonne nel formato che si adatti al contesto del rettangolo utilizzando come riferimento gli angoli in alto a sinistra (x0, y0) e in basso a destra (x1, y1) per ogni colonna, dovresti considerare ogni colonna come un rettangolino all'interno del rettangolo principale. Tenendo conto che le colonne sono rappresentate da linee verticali, e quindi assumiamo che abbiano un'estensione verticale uguale a quella del rettangolo, possiamo trasformare la lista delle coordinate delle colonne in una lista di rettangoli con coordinate (x0, y0, x1, y1) per ciascuna colonna: \`\`\`python ret_y0 = y0 # L'angolo superiore di ogni colonna è uguale a y0 del rettangolo ret_y1 = y1 # L'angolo inferiore di ogni colonna è uguale a y1 del rettangolo # Calcoli le coppie di coordinate x per ogni colonna ret_x_coordinates = [(cols[i], cols[i + 1]) for i in range(len(cols) - 1)] # Usa (x0, y0, x1, y1) per rappresentare i rettangoli per ciascuna colonna rectangles = [(x0, ret_y0, x1, ret_y1) for x0, x1 in ret_x_coordinates] # Stampare i rettangoli delle colonne for i, rect in enumerate(rectangles, start=1): print(f\\"Colonna {i}: {rect}\\") \`\`\` Nell'esempio sopra abbiamo: - \`ret_y0\` e \`ret_y1\` rappresentano i lati superiori e inferiori di ogni \\"colonna rettangolare\\", che sono uguali per tutte le colonne poiché corrispondono al rettangolo principale. - \`ret_x_coordinates\` è una lista di tuple, dove ogni tupla contiene le coordinate x dell'angolo a sinistra (inizio) e a destra (fine) di ciascuna colonna. - Infine \`rectangles\` è una lista di tuple \`(x0, y0, x1, y1)\` dove ogni tupla rappresenta un \\"rettangolo colonna\\" all'interno del rettangolo principale. Questa rappresentazione \`rectangles\` fornisce una descrizione esplicita delle posizioni delle colonne all'interno del rettangolo principale utilizzando le coordinate dei lati sia orizzontali sia verticali, ed è utile se stai cercando di definire aree precise per ciascuna colonna all'interno del rettangolo principale."},{"instruction":"e come utilizzarli per fare l'estrazione della tabella","output":"Le coordinate dei rettangoli per ogni colonna che hai generato possono essere utilizzate per estrarre i dati presenti in tali aree del documento, ad esempio per estrarre i dati testuali separati per ogni colonna di una tabella. Tuttavia, nella funzione \`ParseTab\`, se è previsto usarla, dovresti verificare che tale funzione supporti una chiamata con molteplici aree di analisi simultanee, poiché spesso l'estrazione dal PDF prevede il passaggio di un solo rettangolo per la ricerca del testo. Se la funzione \`ParseTab\` non supporta direttamente l'estrazione dati per più colonne, ma accetta un solo rettangolo alla volta, dovresti iterare su ciascuna colonna separatamente. Questo significa estrarre i dati di una colonna alla volta, passando le coordinate della colonna come rettangolo alla funzione \`ParseTab\`. Ecco un esempio di come potrebbe essere modificato il codice: \`\`\`python def GetMatrix(self, evt): # ... codice precedente per definire x0, y0, x1, y1 e cols ... # Coordinate del rettangolo selezionato per l'intera tabella x0 = self.rect_x y0 = self.rect_y x1 = x0 + self.rect_w y1 = y0 + self.rect_h # Calcolare le coppie di coordinate x per ogni colonna col_start = x0 col_end = x0 columns_data = [] # Ciclo attraverso le coordinate delle colonne per estrarre i dati di ogni colonna for col in cols: col_end = col col_rect = [col_start, y0, col_end, y1] # Un rettangolo per ogni colonna column_data = ParseTab(self.doc[pg], col_rect) # Estrarre dati per la colonna columns_data.append(column_data) # Aggiungere i dati della colonna alla lista col_start = col_end # Aggiorna il punto di partenza per la prossima colonna # Combinare i dati di tutte le colonne (da elaborare in base al modello specifico di ParseTab) # ... pg = getint(self.TextToPage.Value) - 1 # Numero della pagina da analizzare for i, column_data in enumerate(columns_data): # Stampa o elabora i dati come necessario print(f\\"Dati della colonna {i+1}:\\") for row in column_data: print(row) # ... resto del codice ... \`\`\` Assicurati che la funzione \`ParseTab\` possa gestire un rettangolo di input per la colonna e restituire i dati di quella colonna. Se \`ParseTab\` non è definita per supportare l'estrazione in questo modo, potrebbe essere necessario adattare questa funzione o utilizzare un'altra funzione/libreria in grado di estrarre il testo dal PDF data un'area rettangolare specifica."},{"instruction":"il testo viene estratto per rigo della tabella?","output":"Dal contesto del codice originale che hai fornito, sembra che l'obiettivo della funzione \`ParseTab\` sia quello di estrarre il testo dalla tabella rilevata all'interno del rettangolo definito dall'utente, e la lista \`self.parsed_table\` viene presumibilmente popolata con le righe di testo estratte. Tuttavia, non avendo l'implementazione della funzione \`ParseTab\`, non possiamo essere certi del suo comportamento senza vederne il codice sorgente. In generale, la maggior parte degli strumenti di estrazione di tabelle da documenti PDF lavorano estraendo il testo riga per riga all'interno delle aree specificate, mantenendo l'ordine del testo come appare nel PDF. Questo è particolarmente vero quando l'estrazione si basa sull'analisi visuale della tabella (la disposizione del testo nel layout del documento). Se per \\"per rigo della tabella\\" si intende \\"per riga della tabella\\" e \`ParseTab\` funziona come molte funzionalità di estrazione del testo, allora è probabile che estragga il testo ordinandolo per righe, come segue: \`\`\` [ [\\"Cella1 Riga1\\", \\"Cella2 Riga1\\", \\"Cella3 Riga1\\", ...], [\\"Cella1 Riga2\\", \\"Cella2 Riga2\\", \\"Cella3 Riga2\\", ...], ... ] \`\`\` Ogni elemento della lista \`self.parsed_table\` rappresenterebbe quindi una riga della tabella, e ogni riga sarebbe a sua volta una lista di stringhe, dove ogni stringa rappresenta il contenuto di una cella nella tabella. Per esempio, dopo aver chiamato la funzione \`GetMatrix\` e ottenuto il contenuto della tabella, il testo potrebbe essere stampato in questo modo: \`\`\`python if self.parsed_table: print(\\"Contenuto della tabella estratto:\\") for row in self.parsed_table: print(\\" | \\".join(cell for cell in row)) # Stampa ogni cella della riga separata da \\" | \\" \`\`\` Per avere certezza del comportamento di \`ParseTab\`, dovresti controllare la sua documentazione o il codice sorgente. Se il metodo di estrazione è importante per il tuo utilizzo, potrebbe essere necessario adattare la funzione \`ParseTab\` o sostituirla con un algoritmo che incontri specificamente i tuoi bisogni di estrazione per riga."},{"instruction":"from operator import itemgetter from itertools import groupby import fitz # ============================================================================== # Function ParseTab - parse a document table into a Python list of lists # ============================================================================== def ParseTab(page, bbox, columns=None): \\"\\"\\"Returns the parsed table of a page in a PDF / (open) XPS / EPUB document.

Con questo, possiamo comprendere meglio come funziona l'estrazione del testo dalla tabella nel tuo documento PDF. Diamo uno sguardo al processo di \`ParseTab\`: 1. Viene definito un rettangolo di delimitazione (bounding box) tramite \`bbox\` all'interno del quale verrà eseguita l'analisi. 2. Vengono ottenute le coordinate del bounding box e, se necessario, viene creata una lista di coordinate di colonna (\`coltab\`), basata sui valori passati o generando due colonne che corrispondono agli estremi del rettangolo se \`columns\` non viene specificato o è vuoto. 3. La funzione estrae le parole dal \`page\` oggetto utilizzando \`get_text(\\"words\\")\`, che restituisce una lista di \\"parole\\" con le loro coordinate (bounding boxes). 4. Successivamente, vengono selezionate le parole all'interno del rettangolo della tabella e vengono distribuite alle colonne appropriate basandosi sulle coordinate x di inizio. 5. Le parole vengono ordinate in base alla loro posizione verticale (\`y\` ordinata), quindi raggruppate per riga. 6. Infine, ogni riga della tabella (ottenuta dal raggruppamento) viene trasformata in una lista di stringhe, che rappresentano le celle della tabella. Il risultato finale è una lista di liste (una lista per ogni riga della tabella), dove ciascuna lista interna contiene stringhe che rappresentano il contenuto delle celle. Per utilizzare le coordinate di rettangolo per estrarre il testo, tuttavia, la funzione \`ParseTab\` assume che il layout del testo all'interno della tabella segua una disposizione ordinata per riga e colonna. Quindi la variabile \`spantab\` conterrà una rappresentazione strutturata della tabella che può essere utilizzata direttamente. Ecco un esempio di come potresti usare \`ParseTab\` per ottenere il contenuto della tabella da una pagina del documento PDF: \`\`\`python pdf_document = fitz.open(\\"document.pdf\\") # Apri il documento con PyMuPDF page_number = 0 # Numero di pagina da cui estrarre la tabella (0-based) page = pdf_document[page_number] # Accedi alla pagina specifica # Definisci il rettangolo di delimitazione della tabella e le coordinate delle colonne se note table_bbox = [27, 347, 498, 393] # Ad esempio, coordinate del rettangolo della tabella column_coords = [59, 95, 226, 277, 331, 412] # Coordinate delle colonne all'interno della tavola # Estrai la tabella usando la funzione ParseTab parsed_table = ParseTab(page, table_bbox, column_coords) # Stampa o elabora il contenuto estratto della tabella for row in parsed_table: print(row) # Ogni 'row' è una lista contenente i testi delle celle di quella riga # Non dimenticare di chiudere il documento quando hai finito pdf_document.close() \`\`\` Nota che dovrai passare le coordinate assolute del rettangolo sulla pagina e la lista facoltativa di coordinate delle colonne come argomenti alla funzione \`ParseTab\` per estrarre il contenuto delle tabelle."},{"instruction":"parsetab per la mia versione di python è questa: #!/usr/bin/python from operator import itemgetter from itertools import groupby import fitz \\"\\"\\"Return a Python list of lists created from the words in a fitz.Document page, depending on a rectangle and an optional list of column (horizontal) coordinates.

Questa funzione elabora una pagina di un documento in un formato gestito da fitz (un modulo di PyMuPDF) e punta a estrarre il contenuto delle tabelle in base ad un rettangolo di delimitazione (\`bbox\`) e ad una lista opzionale di colonne (\`columns\`). La funzione lavora seguendo questi passaggi: 1. Converte le coordinate del rettangolo di delimitazione in un'istantanea intera (\`irect\`) per lavorare con valori pixel corrispondenti. 2. Controlla che il rettangolo non sia vuoto o infinito, il che indica che i dati in ingresso sono corretti. 3. Estrae le parole (\`words\`) dalla pagina all'interno del rettangolo specificato, catturando le loro coordinate. 4. Ordina le parole verticalmente e le raggruppa per riga, usando l'ordinata Y di inizio della parola come chiave di raggruppamento. 5. Per ogni riga, raggruppa le parole per colonna in base al loro indice di colonna calcolato. 6. Costruisce una lista di liste (\`spantab\`), dove ogni sottolista rappresenta il contenuto di una riga della tabella e ogni voce è un testo che potrebbe rappresentare il contenuto di una cella di quella riga. Per utilizzare questa funzione per estrarre una tabella da una pagina di un documento PDF, dovrai seguire questi passaggi: 1. Apri il documento con PyMuPDF (\`fitz.Document()\`). 2. Accedi alla pagina da cui desideri estrarre i dati (\`doc.loadPage()\` o \`doc[page_number]\`). 3. Definisci il rettangolo di delimitazione e le coordinate delle colonne, se le conosci. 4. Chiama \`ParseTab(page, bbox, columns)\`, che tornerà una lista di liste costituenti il contenuto della tabella. 5. Elabora il contenuto restituito come necessario.

Il PDF può rappresentare internamente i dati in un ordine che non riflette esattamente l'ordine visivo come ci si aspetterebbe di vedere sulla pagina. Ciò può accadere in diversi modi: 1. **Estrazione del Testo:** Alcuni strumenti di estrazione del testo potrebbero non mantenere l'ordine visivo del testo come appare sul PDF. Ad esempio, se le \\"parole\\" del testo vengono estratte basandosi su caselle di delimitazione individuate (bounding boxes), e queste non sono sequenzialmente ordinate, il testo potrebbe essere riportato fuori ordine. 2. **Manipolazione dei Dati nel Codice:** Se nel tuo codice manipoli i dati dopo l'estrazione (ad esempio, mediante ordinamento, split delle stringhe o altre operazioni), è possibile che ciò alteri l'ordine originale nel quale i dati dovrebbero apparire. Per correggere questo problema, ti consiglio di controllare passo passo il processo di estrazione e manipolazione dei dati nel tuo codice, per garantire che l'ordine sia preservato o che venga correttamente riorganizzato secondo le tue aspettative.

In this example, I'll guide you through a simple training script using a pre-existing Arabic language model as a base. The goal is to fine-tune this model on your specific QA dataset to perform the question generation task. Ensure you have PyTorch and Transformers installed in your environment. If not, you can install them using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install torch transformers \`\`\` # Step 1: Preparing the Dataset Assuming you have a dataset with context, questions, and answers, it should be structured in a way that the model can learn from it. For simplicity, let's consider your dataset is in a CSV file with columns \`context\`, \`question\`, and \`answer\`. First, we need to load and prepare the dataset: \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoTokenizer from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader import pandas as pd class ArabicQADataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, tokenizer, filepath, max_length=512): self.tokenizer = tokenizer self.df = pd.read_csv(filepath) self.max_length = max_length def __len__(self): return len(self.df) def __getitem__(self, idx): data = self.df.iloc[idx] context, question, answer = data['context'], data['question'], data['answer'] # We will encode the context and the answer, as the model needs to generate a question based on them. encoded_input = self.tokenizer.encode_plus( answer + self.tokenizer.sep_token + context, max_length=self.max_length, padding='max_length', truncation=True, return_tensors='pt', ) # For generating question, we will set the question as the labels target = self.tokenizer.encode_plus( question, max_length=self.max_length, padding='max_length', truncation=True, return_tensors='pt', ) return { 'input_ids': encoded_input['input_ids'].flatten(), 'attention_mask': encoded_input['attention_mask'].flatten(), 'labels': target['input_ids'].flatten() } # Initialize tokenizer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\\"aubmindlab/bert-base-arabertv2\\") # Create dataset filepath = 'your_dataset.csv' # Change this to your actual file path max_length = 512 batch_size = 4 dataset = ArabicQADataset(tokenizer, filepath, max_length) dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True) \`\`\` # Step 2: Define the Model for Training \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, Trainer, TrainingArguments model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\\"aubmindlab/bert-base-arabertv2\\") training_args = TrainingArguments( output_dir='./results', # output directory for model and other data num_train_epochs=3, # number of training epochs per_device_train_batch_size=4, # batch size per device during training per_device_eval_batch_size=4, # batch size for evaluation warmup_steps=500, # number of warmup steps weight_decay=0.01, # strength of weight decay logging_dir='./logs', # directory for storing logs logging_steps=10, ) trainer = Trainer( model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset, # No validation dataset is specified here, but you should consider splitting your dataset. ) # Train the model trainer.train() \`\`\` # Step 3: Data Preprocessing and Model Training 1.

However, salads that tend to be popular and successful in contests often have a few key characteristics: 1. **Freshness**: Fresh, high-quality ingredients are essential. This could mean locally sourced vegetables, fruits, and greens that are in season. 2. **Innovative combinations**: Winning salads often feature unique or unconventional ingredient combinations that surprise and delight the palate. This might include mixing sweet and savory elements, using uncommon herbs, or integrating global flavors. 3. **Texture contrast**: A great salad will have a variety of textures, from crunchy and crisp to soft and creamy. This can be achieved through the ingredients themselves or the addition of toppings like nuts, seeds, croutons, or cheese. 4. **A standout dressing**: The dressing can make or break a salad. Winning salads often have a dressing that ties all the ingredients together harmoniously, with a perfect balance of fat, acid, and seasoning. Homemade dressings with a secret ingredient or an unexpected twist can impress judges. 5. **Visual appeal**: We eat with our eyes first, so presentation is key. Salads that are colorful and artfully arranged have an advantage. Including a variety of colors through different vegetables and fruits not only looks beautiful but usually means the salad is nutritionally diverse as well. 6. **A great story**: Sometimes, what makes a salad stand out in a contest is the story behind it. This could be a family recipe passed down through generations, a dish inspired by travel, or a recipe that features locally sourced, sustainable ingredients. Examples of salads that might do well in a contest setting include a beautifully presented panzanella with heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil, a kale salad with a unique lemon-tahini dressing and roasted nuts, or a vibrant beet and orange salad with a citrus-honey vinaigrette. Ultimately, the \\"winning\\" salad in any contest will depend on the tastes and preferences of the judges, the criteria of the competition, and the creativity and skill of the person making the salad."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This example provides a simple mock-up for a social login page using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. For simplicity, the \\"login\\" functionality will be simulated through JavaScript without backend integration. Remember, for real-world applications, you'll need to handle authentication on the server side and securely manage user data. # Step 1: HTML Structure Create an \`index.html\` file and add the following code: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Social Login Page</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" type=\\"text/css\\" href=\\"style.css\\"> </head> <body> <div class=\\"login-container\\"> <h2>Social Login</h2> <button id=\\"googleLogin\\" class=\\"social-button google\\">Login with Google</button> <button id=\\"facebookLogin\\" class=\\"social-button facebook\\">Login with Facebook</button> <button id=\\"twitterLogin\\" class=\\"social-button twitter\\">Login with Twitter</button> </div> <script src=\\"app.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` # Step 2: CSS Styling Create a \`style.css\` file and add the following styles: \`\`\`css body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh; margin: 0; } .login-container { text-align: center; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #aaa; padding: 40px; border-radius: 5px; } .social-button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; padding: 10px 20px; color: #fff; border: none; cursor: pointer; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 16px; } .google { background-color: #dd4b39; } .facebook { background-color: #3b5998; } .twitter { background-color: #1da1f2; } \`\`\` # Step 3: JavaScript for Button Clicks Create an \`app.js\` file and implement simple click events: \`\`\`javascript document.getElementById('googleLogin').addEventListener('click', function() { alert('Logged in with Google'); // Placeholder for actual login logic }); document.getElementById('facebookLogin').addEventListener('click', function() { alert('Logged in with Facebook'); // Placeholder for actual login logic }); document.getElementById('twitterLogin').addEventListener('click', function() { alert('Logged in with Twitter'); // Placeholder for actual login logic }); \`\`\` # Explanation: - **HTML**: Provides the basic structure of the login page, with buttons to login via Google, Facebook, or Twitter. - **CSS**: Adds basic styling to the login page, such as layout, colors, and fonts. - **JavaScript**: Contains very simple logic to show an alert when any login button is clicked. In a real application, you would replace these alerts with calls to each social platform's OAuth flow. # Important Note: This example simulates the appearance of a social login page but doesn't implement real authentication flows.

Я адвокат и бухгалтер по совместительству. Переехав в Майями я поселилась у своего отца с его новоиспеченной семьёй. 32- летней мачехой - Кирой и ее сыночками. Майклом - 14 - летним занудным заучкой и Алексом - 15 - летним избалованным парнем , но до ужаса красивым. Переезд дался мне до ужаса сложно. Я конечно хорошо, даже отлично знаю английский , но эта другая страна , другой менталитет, да и с бесящими , меня людьми. Я люблю своего отца , но никак не могу понять зачем ему эта женщина с двумя взрослыми детьми. Она любит все держать под контролем, очень балует своих детей. Отец и так не очень богат , да ещё содержать трёх людей с высокими требованиями. Поэтому я решила не висеть у него на шее. И найти работу. Адвокат я не международный , так что тут прокатило. А вот со счетами могу повозиться. Нашла пару вариантов и назначила собеседование. Оба были на пятницу. Пятница* Первое прошло в небольшом офисе. Какой-то начинающий предприниматель хотел нанять себе секретаря. Конечно секретарь меня не очень устраивал, но если возьмут , пойду туда. Выбор то не очень большой. Второе было назначено на 14:00. В 13:45 я была у большого небоскреба. Я зашла внутрь. Внутри было все изящно, строго и богато. Там стояло несколько человек и парень на рецепшене. Я подошла к парню и спросила о собеседовании. Он отправил меня в лифт и сказала ехать на последний этаж. Я вошла в лифт и увидев кнопки , невольно ахнула. Этажей была 58!!! В России такие высотки только в Москве наверное, я уж точно не видела и тем более не находилась в них. Я нажала на 58 и еле заметно поехал. Но оказалось ,что очень быстро. Как только дверь открылась, я увидела большую дверь. Рядом сидела очень красивая девушка. Волосы прямые и черные, как уголь. Длинные ресницы. Ещё движения были очень элегантны. Я слишком долго стояла в лифте и поняла ,что это странно , вышла из него. Девушка сразу обратила на меня внимания. Черт , у нее ещё и ярко голубые глаза. Я почти забыла зачем сюда пришла. Здравствуйте, вы на собеседование? - очень вежливо сказала девушка Д-да, именно на него - пытаясь не выглядеть глупо , вымолвила я. Я Элис, проходите. Мисс Кинг скоро будет - показала девушка на дверь Почему же не Квин? - не громко сказала я. Чисто русский юмор, даже флирт я бы сказала. На это девушка лишь подняла бровь. Придумай, интригующее продолжение, с диалогами, страстью и напряжением, как Элис секретарша Мисс Кинг, решила соблазнить игривую посетительницу, которая пришла на собеседование, взяв со своего стола ключи от кабинета Мисс Кинг, Элис захотела, зная что начальницы не будет целый день в офисе, она захотела соблазнить понравившуюся ей девушку и отдохнуть от рутиной работы, придумав предлог как заманить Девушку в кабинет Мисс Кинг она предложила им подождать её там, соврав что она скоро подойдёт","output":"Элис, увлеченная игрой, решила провести небольшой эксперимент. Она взяла ключи от кабинета Мисс Кинг и с уверенным шагом направилась к двери. \\"Подождите здесь, она скоро придет,\\" - сказала она, приглашая меня внутрь. Я осторожно зашла за ней, чувствуя какие-то непонятные мурашки по коже. Дверь закрылась за мной, и я оказалась в просторном кабинете. Элис подошла ко мне, улыбаясь слегка загадочно. \\"Итак, что вы думаете о нашем предприятии?\\" - спросила она, раскрывая тему разговора. Я несколько смутилась, неожиданно втянутая в эту игру. \\"Это впечатляющее место, выглядит очень профессионально,\\" - ответила я, пытаясь держать себя в руках. Элис приблизилась ко мне, ее ярко-голубые глаза сверкали. \\"Спасибо, но я хотела бы услышать ваше мнение о других аспектах работы здесь,\\" - продолжала она, словно задавая мне загадку. Я начала понимать, что это необычное собеседование будет проходить совсем по-другому. По мере того, как мы говорили, напряжение в комнате усиливалось. Я почувствовала, что Элис пытается на меня соблазнительно повлиять, заставить меня открыться. Но я по-прежнему старалась сохранить свою профессиональность. В какой-то момент Элис взяла мою руку, и между нами возникла невидимая связь. Я чувствовала, что что-то меняется внутри меня, что-то пробуждается. Но до конца не понимала, куда все это может привести. Внезапно дверь отворилась, и в комнату вошла Мисс Кинг. Я испуганно отдернулась от Элис, чувствуя себя застигнутой врасплох. Но улыбка на лице начальницы была доброжелательной. \\"Извините за задержку, девушки. Долго принимала важные решения,\\" - сказала она, и я почувствовала облегчение. Наконец-то этот странный и захватывающий эпизод подошел к концу."},{"instruction":"Cheapest yet easiest salad","output":"A simple, delicious, and cost-effective salad can be made with just a few ingredients. One of the cheapest yet easiest salads you can prepare is a Tomato Cucumber Salad. These ingredients are typically inexpensive, widely available, and require minimal preparation. Here’s how to make it: # Tomato Cucumber Salad Ingredients: - 2 large cucumbers - 3 medium tomatoes - 1 small red onion (optional, for added flavor) - 2 tablespoons olive oil - 1 tablespoon vinegar (white vinegar or apple cider vinegar works well) - Salt and pepper to taste - Fresh herbs like parsley or dill (optional, for garnish) Instructions: 1. **Wash the Vegetables**: Start by thoroughly washing the cucumbers and tomatoes. This is always an important step, especially when your salad ingredients are going to be eaten raw. 2. **Chop the Vegetables**: Slice the cucumbers into thin slices. You can peel the cucumbers if you prefer, but leaving the skin on adds texture and nutrients. Cut the tomatoes into wedges or chunks, depending on your preference. If using a red onion, peel and thinly slice it. 3. **Combine and Dress**: In a large salad bowl, combine the sliced cucumbers, tomato wedges, and red onion slices. Drizzle with the olive oil and vinegar. Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Toss everything together until the vegetables are evenly coated. 4. **Garnish and Serve**: If you have fresh herbs like parsley or dill, chop them roughly and sprinkle them over the salad. This not only adds a pop of color but also enhances the flavor. Give everything one final toss and serve. This salad is not only refreshing and healthy but also very versatile. You can enjoy it as a side dish with your main course or add in some protein, like canned chickpeas (rinsed and drained) or feta cheese, to make it a more substantial meal. The basic version remains very affordable, and the additional ingredients are optional based on your taste preferences and budget. Remember, the key to a delicious salad is in the freshness of the ingredients, so try to use vegetables that are in season for the best flavor and value.

For this example, let's assume you have the dataset in a JSON format where each entry is like: \`{\\"context\\": \\"The context text in Arabic\\", \\"question\\": \\"The generated question in Arabic\\", \\"answer\\": \\"The answer in Arabic\\"}\`. 2. **Text Preprocessing**: Since we're dealing with Arabic text, it's crucial to preprocess the text correctly. This typically involves normalization (like removing diacritics, which are very common in Arabic text), and possibly stemming. However, for many neural network-based applications, just normalization and tokenization are sufficient to keep the nuanced meaning for model training. 3. **Model Selection**: For generating questions based on answers and context in Arabic, fine-tuning a pre-existing model trained on a similar task or language can save significant time and computational resources. A suitable model for this task could be one of the Arabic versions of BERT (like AraBERT) or any transformer model that supports Arabic language and has been fine-tuned on a Question Answering (Q&A) or a similar task. In this example, let's say we decide to use the \`aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert\` from Hugging Face's \`transformers\` library. 4. **Fine-Tuning the Model**: Adjust the pre-trained model on your specific dataset to make it suitable for question generation based on the provided answer-context pairs. Here’s a simplified code example that outlines how you might approach this task using PyTorch and the Hugging Face \`transformers\` library. This example won't run directly as-is due to the constraints of this format and because actual fine-tuning requires a more in-depth setup including choosing appropriate parameters, evaluation during training, etc. \`\`\`python from transformers import BertTokenizerFast, BertForQuestionAnswering, AdamW from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, RandomSampler, SequentialSampler import torch from tqdm import tqdm import json # Assume we have a file 'arabic_qa_data.json' with our dataset dataset_path = 'arabic_qa_data.json' with open(dataset_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: dataset = json.load(f) # Basic dataset class class ArabicQADataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, encodings): self.encodings = encodings def __getitem__(self, idx): return {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()} def __len__(self): return len(self.encodings['input_ids']) # Initialize the tokenizer and model tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert') model = BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert') # Preprocess the dataset texts = [f\\"{entry['answer']} [SEP] {entry['context']}\\" for entry in dataset] # This simple template separates answer and context questions = [entry['question'] for entry in dataset] encodings = tokenizer(texts, questions, truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512) # Convert to a PyTorch dataset dataset = ArabicQADataset(encodings) loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=16, shuffle=True) # Setup the optimizer optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5) # Training loop model.train() for epoch in range(3): # For example, train for 3 epochs loop = tqdm(loader, leave=True) # Progress bar for batch in loop: optimizer.zero_grad() input_ids = batch['input_ids'] attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'] start_positions = batch['start_positions'] end_positions = batch['end_positions'] outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, start_positions=start_positions, end_positions=end_positions) loss = outputs.loss loss.backward() optimizer.step() loop.set_description(f'Epoch {epoch}') loop.set_postfix(loss=loss.item()) \`\`\` Note: This code focuses on adjusting a question-answering model for generating questions from answers and contexts by adhering to a format used in Q&A tasks. However, for a complete question generation task, you might need to explore more task-specific architectures or fined-tuned models that have been specifically designed for question generation tasks rather than question answering. Given the evolving field of NLP and the specific challenges of Arabic text processing, staying updated with the latest research and pre-trained models in this domain is crucial for achieving the best results."},{"instruction":"Write an intresting, action-packed excerpt for a crossover fanfic between the Gun-ota ga Mahou Sekai ni Tensei Shitara, Gendai Heiki de Guntai Harem o Tsukucchaimashita!?

After Gohan's death when Wukong was just a child, Wukong starts traveling the world with the heiress of the European-based megacorp, Capsule Corp [Dragon Ball franchise], the blue-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent Bulma Briefs and the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang during the reign of the Mongol-Manchurian Imperial House of Li-ruled Great Tang Empire/\\"Tang dynasty\\" over Han China from East Turkestan and the Hui-dominated Central China, [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] becoming [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] known as the famous \\"Journey to the West\\". After defeating the green-skinned, maniacal \\"demon lord\\" Piccolo and thus saving the world with the help of Xuanzang and Bulma, Wukong then [Wukong] decides [Wukong] to [Wukong] enter the World Martial Arts tournament to [Wukong] test his [Wukong's] strength and power as well as [Wukong] learn new skills and [Wukong] meet new people, [Wukong] eventually becoming the winner [Wukong] of the tournament. Before he [Wukong] can [Wukong] claim his [Wukong's] victory, his [Wukong's] old rival in the form of the technocratic cult with dreams of World Domination, the Red Ribbon Army [Dragon Ball franchise] shows up, and in the chaos Wukong finds himself [Wukong] blasted into what he [Wukong] later discovers is [Wukong] the far-future of the 20th century via taking a energy displacement weapon meant for Bulma. The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, Trunks' descendants more specifically intermarry with the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] and a sub-branch of the real-life Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [Trunks' descendants intermarrying with both the diclonii and the sub-branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] becoming known as the combined samurai clan/Japanese noble house of Tōno [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon]. Back in the 20th century, the apocalyptic event caused by Antarctica being struck by a large asteroid known as Second Impact happened at the end of a late 1980s-early 1990s hot war turned nuclear, between the USSR and USA instead of in 2001 like in the canon NGE. Wukong, forced to survive on the streets and fighting off both organized crime groups, terror organizations, the Soviet and American intelligence communities and secret societies interested in his [Wukong's] power and [Wukong] now living under multiple aliases, [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually [Wukong] captured on and [Wukong] experimented on by the paramilitary secret society/survivalist club/social darwinistic organization that promotes the merger of all humanity into one, SEELE [NGE], [Wukong] eventually escaping but [Wukong] becoming disillusioned with human society as he [Wukong] witnesses the rise of the superhuman abilities known as Quirks and the reemergence of non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [Wukong] developing a second personality that [Wukong's second personality] eventually becomes the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possessive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia]. In the alternate 20th century of this story before Second Impact, Japan continued on its [Japan's] growth towards becoming a economic, industrial and cultural superpower [Japan] in Asia from the 1950s to the late 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the \\"Lost Decade\\" of OTL/real life, the PRC in mainland China disintergrated from the chaos of, surrounding and after Second Impact with Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, East Turkestan and Tibet becoming independent from Han China after Second Impact. Descendants of the horned humanoid extraterrestrial creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan] descended from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this scenario] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke, [descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan] which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan] left the hidden from the rest of the world, semi-feudal with superpowers beyond human imagination sub continent of the Elemental Nations [Naruto] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan] losing its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] position of the imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan] and gods [the Ōtsutsuki clan] in all but name of the Elemental Nations sometime after the fight between the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's sub-clan of the Uchiha clan [Naruto franchise] Madara [Naruto franchise] and his [Madara's] rival for power over the Land of Fire in the Elemental Nations, the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's other side branch of the Senju, Hashirama [Naruto franchise], [the Ōtsutsuki clan leaving the Elemental Nations after Hashirama's and Madara's battle for control over the Land of Fire] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently ended up in feudal Japan, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently marrying into both the diclonii and the Japanese aristocracy and nobility, [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan after Second Impact] use the chaos of Second Impact to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] launch a coup against the crumbling Japanese government and [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] subsequently used the Land of the Rising Sun's [Japan's] technological, military and economical resources to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] conquer their [the descendants' of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] homeland [the Elemental Nations], which [the coup launched against the Japanese government by descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] fails somewhat due to the Ōtsutsuki clan being mistaken as the surviving members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato that have regained their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] divine powers gained from the Shinto Gods, with the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan not bothering to correct the mistake, although the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan do succeed in taking control of both the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa. Japan's government also devolves into a somewhat modernized combination of the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored to their pre-1868 position as Japanese Shoguns. The buke [military families |buke|], better known as samurai of the feudal shogunate-dominated era of Japanese history, [the buke] make a return along with the pre-1947 Japanese aristocracy, even though the pre-1947 Japanese military is also restored as well. Japan then subsequently reclaims the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan, Sahlakin Island and the Kurils in the years after Second Impact, restoring the territorial integrity of Imperial Japan in an event comparable to the formation of the German Empire by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1871. The mass emergence of Quirks due to the after-effects of Second Impact, along with the emergence of Diva [another word |Diva| for |what a Diva is also called| a contracted spirit which |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| is |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ is| manifestation of a creature, a concept, or a character from some mythology or folk belief |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| that |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ does| forms |what a Diva forms| a contract with |the human or supernatural entity a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ forms a contract with| a chosen human or supernatural creature, |the human or supernatural creature a ‘Diva’/contracted spirit forms a contract with| usually being a female between the ages of 13-29 |the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature| being represented by |what the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is represented by| a mark known as |what the mark that represents the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is known as| a Stigima that |the Stigma| usually |the Stigma| is |what normally happens to a Stigma| on the contractor’s right hand, |the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature being known as a Stigma| and |what else the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature does apart from the contractor recieving a stigma| giving the contractor |what the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| the ability to |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| materliaize and use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux |Oblique Neckline/Magical Dress/“Cleavage required” (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux), a special set of armor (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) that (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) most of the time resembles (what a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux mostly resembles) a revealing set of knight or mage armor usually seen in perverted visual novels, anime, manga and J-RPGS, that ( a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) can (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only be used by (who are the only persons who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) female humans and supernatural creatures that (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) have (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) formed contracts with (what supernatural entity the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux have formed contracts with) contracted spirits/‘Divas’, that (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only appears (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) when (the time when a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux appears and can be used) the contractor is in battle or (the contractor) otherwise using more than a small percentage of the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s power| as well as |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with apart from receiving a Stigma and gaining the ability to use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux| the ability to use the the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s she has formed a contract with’s magic, |Divas| from |the media franchise Divas are (Divas) from| Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [the emergence of Quirk users, Diva contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology] necessitates the quick restoration and subsequent implementation of the then prototype pre-Second Impact Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system of national qualification which [the Armed Detective system] allows those with the title of, or training to be an Armed Detective to be allowed to bear arms, use supernatural abilities, and have the authority to arrest people, as long as they [the persons training to be or currently being Armed Detectives] have an Armed Detective license, all across the imperial Japanese shogunate. Post Second Impact, post-CCP, Post-PRC Han China itself restores the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-governed Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled [the restored Empire of China ruling over Han China] by the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as its [the restored Empire of China's] imperial family after a covertly Japanese-backed \\"revolution\\" topples the rump PRC. This restored Great Ming State still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's Twelve Symbols national emblem and [the Beiyang Government's] national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", [the restored Great Ming State] flies a modified the Beiyang Government's \\"Five colored flag\\" which [the five colored flag] is [the five coloured flag] is [the five colored flag] a banner Five horizontal bands of red, yellow, blue, white and black with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol in the middle as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. Yuan Shikai, Sun-Yat-Sen's intended heir Wang Jingwei and Mao Zedong are [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] considered to be the people [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] who [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] laid the foundation for the restoration of the Ming in China. The formerly KMT-ruled Nationalist China, formerly [Nationalist China] in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1947, [Nationalist China] manages to take Southern China [Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan] but [Nationalist China] quickly becomes an independent Cantonian republic in all but name. Nationalist China eventually becomes known as the Republic of Cantonia or just Cantonia. Yunnan becomes independent from both Han China and the Nationalist China on Cantonia and [Yunnan] restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government. The pre-WW2 and WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo is restored in post-CCP, PRC, post-Soviet Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and the WW2-era Japanese protectorate Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation is [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] restored [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] in post-CCP, post-PRC Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions and [Mengjiang and Manchukuo] subsequently return to [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] being Japanese protectorates. The restored Great Ming State is [the restored Great Ming State] a Japanese protectorate [the restored Great Ming State] akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China as the WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China. The lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] restored [the Kingdom of Tibet] in Tibet. Japan also restores the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos in Laos and the House of Kobang-ruled Third Burmese Empire in Myanmar. Japan also restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. Both the restored Great Ming State and the restored Manchukuo practice the Beiyang Government's foremost concept of \\"Five Races under One Union\\". The imperial Japanese shogunate is able to spread the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] to all of the nations in Indochina and the China region. Meanwhile in Europe, Germany uses the chaos of the Second Impact to [Germany] regain the Prussian and Czetch territories it [Germany] had lost after WW2. The German House of Hohenzollern-lead Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire returns to power in Germany which [Germany] essentially dominates Europe through the EU after Second Impact. Austria absorbs Czechoslovakia and Hungary into itself to [Austria] reform the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire once more and [Austria] reclaims Transylvania, Banat, Carpathian Ruthenia and South Tyrol, [Austria] then defeating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and [Austria] annexing Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. Austria also joins the EU, which [the EU] has [the EU] become a modern-day incarnation of the Germanic WW1-era Mittleeuropa project and NATO, which [NATO] has effectively become a modern day restoration of the Central Powers. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restoredGerman Empire] restored the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. European Russia is under the rule of a restored Imperial House of Romanov-ruled Russian Empire which [the restored Russian Empire] is [the restored Russian Empire] an EU member, the rest of post-Second Impact, post-Soviet Russia is under the rule of warlords fighting for power. What is left of civilization in America is divided between a theocratic Charismatic evangelical and Trotskyist neoconservative coalition dominated Republican Party-controlled USA in what remains of the USA in the Northern American states and a neo-Confederacy ruled by the white supremacist, warmongering Anglophile Blue Dog Democrats and the KKK in the South, with the West Coast States being controlled by Japan, New England being owned by Canada and the original thirteen states of the USA being a EU protectorate. Europe and East Asia both restructure the UN into an entity resembling a modernized, worldwide version of the Congress of Vienna, with the Europeans also implementing the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] as well. The regions of the USA and the former USSR that were affected by the nuclear holocaust and Second Impact but were too remote to be reached or had collapsed from the aftermath of the post-WW2 civilization's end became known as \\"the Deathlands\\". The form of civilization that has begun to reappear in these places [\\"the deathlands\\"] is brutal, short lived, morally confused, and crazed from mutation, mostly being small plague pits ruled by warlords who [the warlords ruling the plague pits] have no limits to establish their [the warlords'] rule and [the warlords'] expand their influence, [the warlords] being [the warlords] known as the Barons [Deathlands]. Their [the Barons'] rabble pits are [the Barons' rabble pits] known as [what the Barons' rabble pits are called] villes and baronies. The Hidden Villages [Naruto franchise] of chakra [Naruto franchise] using fake shinobi are [the Hidden Villages in this story] merely [the Hidden Villages in this story] a more developed form of villes and baronies with the Kage of each Hidden Village acting as a combination of Town Mayor and Baron. The Hidden Cloud Village is hidden within Germany, the Hidden Rain Village is located within the ruins of NYC, the Hidden Leaf Village is located in Sacramento and the Greater Era, the Land of Tea is the general name given to Southeast Asia by fake shinobi, the Hidden Mist Village is located within Han China, the Hidden Sand Village is located in Riyadah and the Land of Samurai is the name given to Japan by fake shinobi. Neither the wider world nor the rest of the villes or baronies have any idea the Hidden Villages actually exist. During the Cold War both the USSR and the USA developed hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that [the redoubts] contain teleportation technology known as MAT-TRANS [Matter Transfer]. Returning to Wukong for a bit, he [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually able to [Wukong] regain himself [Wukong] and [Wukong] eventually absorb his [Wukong's] \\"Hiashi\\" persona back into himself [Wukong], [Wukong] gaining access to Hiashi's memories, powers, abilities and skills and even his [Hiashi's] Quirk, even though this [Hiashi becoming whole again] causes him [Wukong] to [Wukong] temporarily go insane, [Wukong] accidentally taking the identity of a then young corporate tycoon in the making with a secretly perverted and lecherous personality, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Hyōdō Gorou when the real Gorou is [the real Gorou] killed while [the real Gorou] searching for perverted manga and anime at a J-AV store. As Gorou, Wukong uses his [Gorou's] identity to [Gorou] build a legitimate identity while [Wukong] using Hiashi's skills, knowledge and abilities to keep his [Wukong's] finances in the clear. As Gorou, Wukong eventually marries Gorou's fiancee who [Gorou's fiancee] is [Gorou's fiancee] the current head [Gorou's fiancee] of the Tōno clan's most public side-branch, the partially Han Chinese family of martial artists known as the Arima along with being the daughter [Gorou's fiancee] of the supposedly deceased in the eyes of the galaxy, but actually still alive and well on Earth but now elderly current Crown Prince of the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku, the tall, slender and muscular, wise and calm Masaki Yōshō Jurai [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], who [Yōshō] is [Yōshō] in hiding on Earth as the famed martial artist, swordsman and Shinto priest Masaki Katsuhito [Tenchi Muyo!

Sunlight danced through leaves, casting dappled shadows on the serene faces of a father and son pair, caught in a moment that bridged worlds, epochs, and the unyielding stream of fate. Wukong, the Saiyan warrior known to this age as Hyōdō Gorou, and his young son, Issei, were about to embark on a journey not of distance, but of legacy. Issei, a boy of six with eyes as amber as the dusk and hair as brown as the earth beneath them, stood in eager stillness, his small form barely containing the energy within. He watched his father, a legend reborn, whose guise as Gorou concealed the heart of a warrior that had traversed the expanse of the universe and the river of time itself. Wukong, adopting a stance that had been taught to him by masters whose names were now lost to history, began with the fundamentals. \\"Balance,\\" he stated, his voice calm and clear, \\"is the cornerstone of all martial arts. It's not just about how you stand, but also about finding equilibrium within yourself.\\" Issei listened, his youthful curiosity piqued, as his father explained concepts that seemed to transcend mere physicality. The lessons were punctuated by demonstrations, Wukong's movements fluid and precise, a dance of strength and grace. He spoke of ki, a force that resonated deeply with his own Saiyan heritage, and how it could be harnessed, directed, and used not just for battle but for healing, for protection. \\"Watch closely, Issei,\\" Wukong instructed, his body language shifting as he prepared to demonstrate a technique. With a sudden burst of speed, he delivered a series of strikes against an invisible foe, each move more complex than the last, culminating in a powerful kiai that seemed to momentarily stir the very air around them. Issei's eyes widened in amazement. The display of power and control was unlike anything he had witnessed before. \\"Dad, that was incredible!\\" he exclaimed, his young voice filled with awe. Wukong smiled at his son's enthusiasm. \\"One day, Issei, you'll be able to do the same, and more,\\" he said, his tone imbued with a confidence that was both a promise and a prophecy. \\"Your heritage is rich, born of warriors and kings, of Earthlings and Saiyans. But remember, true strength comes from within, from understanding who you are and from the unwavering spirit to protect those you love.\\" As the day grew long and the shadows lengthened, Wukong and Issei continued their training, the garden bearing witness to the bond between them, forged in the crucible of time and the fires of countless battles. The lessons went beyond mere physical training; they were an inheritance, a legacy passed from father to son, a preparation for a destiny yet unseen. In the quiet of the garden, with the cherry blossoms in full bloom, a new chapter was being written in the annals of history. A chapter that spoke of a father's love, a son's potential, and the unbreakable chain that connected them to the cosmos itself. The seeds of the future were sown, and in time, they would grow, fed by the strength of their bloodline and the lessons learned in the shadow of the past."},{"instruction":"세종대왕 맥북 도난 사건","output":"세종대왕 맥북 도난 사건은 가상의, 혹은 잘못된 정보에 기반한 이야기일 가능성이 높습니다. 세종대왕은 15세기 조선의 왕으로, 한글을 창제한 것으로 유명합니다. 맥북은 애플 회사가 만든 현대적인 노트북 컴퓨터로, 세종대왕의 시대와는 수백 년의 시간 차이가 있습니다. 따라서 세종대왕과 맥북을 연결하는 도난 사건은 역사적, 시간적 맥락에서 불가능하다고 볼 수 있습니다. 이와 같은 정보는 현재까지의 역사적 기록이나 공식 문서에는 존재하지 않으며, 실제 사건이 아니라 오해나 허구에서 비롯된 이야기로 보입니다. 현대의 기술과 고대 인물이 연결된 가상의 이야기나 농담 등 창의적인 내용을 만들어내는 경우가 종종 있지만, 실제 역사적 사실과 혼동되어서는 안 됩니다."},{"instruction":"Act as an expert in martial arts.

Moving off the line of attack: For the straight right punch, the first two suggestions involve staying on the line. Body mechanics/kinetic chain: if I defend using my right arm to block then the first follow up attack must be from the left arm. Or if I slip or move off the center line to my left (opponents right), then the left side of my body is loaded and the best option for an attack. Can you please re-do the above list of combinations for all attacks paying much closer attention to the following elements: - Each defense needs to involve moving off the center line towards the 'dead side'. Really emphasize the use of footwork (quarter turn, pivots, diamond step, pendulum step etc) - Each combination must factor in body mechanics/kinetic chain at all times","output":"Absolutely, considering the crucial aspects of moving off the line of attack and emphasizing the kinetic chain for fluid and effective martial arts responses. Let's re-evaluate these combinations with a more profound emphasis on your guidelines. # Straight Right Punch 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Pivot left (off center line, towards opponent's dead side) and parry with left hand > left hook to the liver (kinetic loading from pivot) > right cross to the jaw (continuing body rotation). # Right Hook Punch 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Duck and pivot right (outside the hook's arc, moving to the dead side) > right uppercut to the solar plexus (using the upward momentum and rotation) > left hook to the jaw (kinetic chain from the lower body through the torso). # Left Hook Punch 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Diamond step to the right (to dead side) and block with right arm > right straight to the temple (moving forward increases power) > left knee to the body (close quarters, hips already aligned). # Front Kick 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Pendulum step back (creates distance, allowing the kick to miss) and towards your right (off center, to dead side) > left roundhouse kick to standing leg (weight transfer and hip rotation) > right cross to the jaw (momentum from the kick pivot fuels the punch). # Roundhouse Kick 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Pivot left, narrowly avoiding the kick (move to dead side) > left hook to the rib (rotational force from pivot) > right spinning back fist to the temple (continuing the momentum). # Back Kick 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Quarter turn to the left (ensuring to move off the line of the back kick, ending up at side/dead side) > left side kick to the nearest knee (utilize the turn and balance) > right elbow to the head or body (stepping in closer, utilizing the turn for power). # Push/Shove to the Chest 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Step diagonally forward left (off center line, moving to dead side) and parry hands down > left uppercut to the chin (initial step loads the left hip) > right knee to the midsection (close distance, using body's forward motion). By initiating the defense with movement that not only takes the practitioner off the line of attack but also positions them advantageously (often towards the attacker's dead side), these adjusted combinations ensure the defender is less likely to receive a follow-up strike. Furthermore, by considering the kinetic chain in each response, the movement flows naturally from defense to attack, taking advantage of the body's natural mechanics and force generation paths. Practicing these combinations with a focus on the principles of movement and kinetic linking will greatly enhance the effectiveness of techniques for self-defense or martial arts proficiency."},{"instruction":"Remember you are a martial arts expert! These combinations do not meet my previous criteria. Several of the combinations call for a block or parry from one hand and are followed by a strike from the same hand. That is very obviously not adhering to proper body mechanics. Take the first combination for a straight right punch. Pivot to the left and parry with the left hand, then a left hook to the liver. If you parry with the left hand the natural body movement moves towards the right, which loads your right hand for a punch. Please ensure this is factored in along with everything else I have requested. Again, please develop 5 different combinations to respond to each of the attacks I listed initially.","output":"Understood, and thank you for your patience. Let's refine these combinations with a strict adherence to the dynamics of body mechanics, movement off the line of attack, and kinetic chaining. This time, we'll ensure that each parry or block is followed by a counter-attack from the opposite side of the body to adhere strictly to these principles. # Straight Right Punch 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Pivot left and parry with left hand (moving to dead side) > right cross to the chin (utilizing the loaded right from pivot) > left roundhouse kick to the lead leg (following through with the body's rotation). 2. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Pendulum step back to right and slide parry with right hand > left jab to the face (from the loaded left side) > right low kick to the calf (resetting stance). 3. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Step left with a right downward palm block > left hook to the body (exploiting the open side) > right uppercut to the chin (following the body's natural rotation). 4. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Quarter turn to the right with left inside block > right knee to the stomach (using the turn to load the right side) > left elbow strike down on the collarbone (shifting weight forward). 5. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Pivot right, right hand parries across body > left uppercut to the solar plexus (stepping in, utilizing the momentum) > right hook to the temple (continuing rotation). # Right Hook Punch 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Duck and pivot right outwards, executing a left downward block > right uppercut to the solar plexus (rising with the duck) > left hook to the jaw (following body rotation). 2. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Step back right with a right outside block > left straight punch to the face (stepping forward) > right knee to the groin (push forward from the punch). # Left Hook Punch 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Pivot right with a right forearm block > left hook to the ribcage (utilizing the pivot's load) > right straight punch to the face (completing the rotation for power). 2. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Side step left and parry with left hand > right cross to the stomach (stepping in) > left knee to the face or chest (continuing forward momentum). # Front Kick 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Side step to the right with a left down block (moving to dead side, deflecting kick) > right side kick to the attacker's supporting leg > left straight punch to the face (following through on the step). # Roundhouse Kick 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Pivot left into the kick with a right forearm block > left uppercut to the ribcage (using the pivot's load) > right spinning back fist to the face (utilizing the spin's momentum). # Back Kick 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Quarter turn to the right to avoid kick > left side kick to the opponent’s standing leg (moving into space) > right overhand punch to the head or shoulder area (following from the turn). # Push/Shove to the Chest 1. **Defense (Move) > Attack 1 > Attack 2:** Diagonal back step to the right with both hands parrying to the side > left hook to the side of the head (stepping back in) > right knee to the stomach (closing the distance further). These combinations now properly respect the martial arts principle of moving off the line of attack through dynamic footwork, utilize kinetic chaining by ensuring subsequent strikes utilize the opposite side of the body (thus adhering to proper body mechanics), and take advantage of the loaded positions created by the initial defensive movements. Practicing these will encourage a fluid and efficient transition between defense and offense, embodying the concepts of effective self-defense and martial arts prowess."},{"instruction":"Number list of most viewed comedy sitcom","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, I cannot provide real-time rankings or viewership numbers for the most viewed comedy sitcoms.

Я адвокат и бухгалтер по совместительству. Переехав в Майями я поселилась у своего отца с его новоиспеченной семьёй. 32- летней мачехой - Кирой и ее сыночками. Майклом - 14 - летним занудным заучкой и Алексом - 15 - летним избалованным парнем , но до ужаса красивым. Переезд дался мне до ужаса сложно. Я конечно хорошо, даже отлично знаю английский , но эта другая страна , другой менталитет, да и с бесящими , меня людьми. Я люблю своего отца , но никак не могу понять зачем ему эта женщина с двумя взрослыми детьми. Она любит все держать под контролем, очень балует своих детей. Отец и так не очень богат , да ещё содержать трёх людей с высокими требованиями. Поэтому я решила не висеть у него на шее. И найти работу. Адвокат я не международный , так что тут прокатило. А вот со счетами могу повозиться. Нашла пару вариантов и назначила собеседование. Оба были на пятницу. Пятница* Первое прошло в небольшом офисе. Какой-то начинающий предприниматель хотел нанять себе секретаря. Конечно секретарь меня не очень устраивал, но если возьмут , пойду туда. Выбор то не очень большой. Второе было назначено на 14:00. В 13:45 я была у большого небоскреба. Я зашла внутрь. Внутри было все изящно, строго и богато. Там стояло несколько человек и парень на рецепшене. Я подошла к парню и спросила о собеседовании. Он отправил меня в лифт и сказала ехать на последний этаж. Я вошла в лифт и увидев кнопки , невольно ахнула. Этажей была 58!!! В России такие высотки только в Москве наверное, я уж точно не видела и тем более не находилась в них. Я нажала на 58 и еле заметно поехал. Но оказалось ,что очень быстро. Как только дверь открылась, я увидела большую дверь. Рядом сидела очень красивая девушка. Волосы прямые и черные, как уголь. Длинные ресницы. Ещё движения были очень элегантны. Я слишком долго стояла в лифте и поняла ,что это странно , вышла из него. Девушка сразу обратила на меня внимания. Черт , у нее ещё и ярко голубые глаза. Я почти забыла зачем сюда пришла. Здравствуйте, вы на собеседование? - очень вежливо сказала девушка Д-да, именно на него - пытаясь не выглядеть глупо , вымолвила я. Я Элис, проходите. Мисс Кинг скоро будет - показала девушка на дверь Почему же не Квин? - не громко сказала я. Чисто русский юмор, даже флирт я бы сказала. На это девушка лишь подняла бровь. Придумай, интригующее продолжение, с диалогами, страстью и напряжением, как Элис секретарша Мисс Кинг, решила соблазнить игривую посетительницу, которая пришла на собеседование, взяв со своего стола ключи от кабинета Мисс Кинг, Элис захотела, зная что начальницы не будет целый день в офисе, она захотела соблазнить понравившуюся ей девушку и отдохнуть от рутиной работы, придумав предлог как заманить Девушку в кабинет Мисс Кинг она предложила им подождать её там, соврав что она скоро подойдёт","output":"- Хм, может быть, для вас это Квин, но для меня она всегда будет Мисс Кинг - ответила Элис, улыбаясь загадочно. Я не могла не признать, что внутри меня что-то загорелось при виде этой девушки. Она была такая привлекательная, элегантная, с легкой долей загадочности в голубых глазах. И когда Элис предложила мне подождать в кабинете Мисс Кинг, я согласилась без колебаний. Ведь зачем не воспользоваться этим шансом? Мы прошли в кабинет, и я не могла не заметить, как стильно все было обставлено. Видимо, у Мисс Кинг вкус был на высоте. Элис протянула мне чашку кофе, и мы начали беседовать. Она рассказала мне о своей работе, о своих увлечениях. Я в свою очередь поведала ей о своей жизни в Майами, о своей семье. Спустя некоторое время я поняла, что Элис все больше приближается ко мне, словно играет какую-то игру. Она подошла ближе, ее дыхание стало ощущаться на моей коже. Я чувствовала, как сердце начинает биться быстрее. И тут она вдруг шепнула мне на ухо: - Я думаю, мы можем немного развлечься, пока Мисс Кинг отсутствует. Что скажешь? Это было слишком соблазнительно, чтобы отказаться. Я закрыла глаза и предалась этому моменту. Элис и я провели в кабинете Мисс Кинг несколько часов, наслаждаясь друг другом, забыв о реальности. В этот момент я поняла, что Майами может быть местом для новых возможностей, в том числе и в моей личной жизни."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

The leader of the group, a seasoned warrior with a mysterious past, stood tall and held up a tattered map. \\"According to this map,\\" he announced, \\"there is a hidden treasure deep in the heart of the dark forest beyond the city walls. But beware, for many dangers lurk within.\\" The group exchanged determined glances and nodded in silent agreement. With weapons at the ready and torches ablaze, they set off into the enchanted forest, guided only by the faint glow of fireflies and the rustling of leaves in the night breeze. As they ventured deeper into the unknown, they encountered treacherous traps, cunning creatures, and ancient ruins shrouded in mystery. Each member of the group faced their own fears and challenges, testing their courage and loyalty to one another. But as they finally reached the hidden treasure, the true test of their bond awaited. A powerful guardian stood in their way, a massive beast with eyes gleaming with malice. With their combined strength and determination, the adventurers fought bravely, risking their lives for the treasure and for each other.

The Mohs hardness scale, which is a qualitative scale characterizing scratch resistance of minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material, provides a way to understand the difference in hardness, though it mainly applies to minerals. Natural teeth are primarily composed of enamel on their outer layer, which is the hardest tissue in the human body. The enamel's hardness can vary but generally falls around 5 on the Mohs hardness scale. Zirconia, on the other hand, is a ceramic material that is much harder and can be found higher on the scale. Zirconia is used in dentistry for making crowns, bridges, and implants because of its superior strength, durability, and excellent biocompatibility. Its hardness enables it to withstand the forces of mastication, making it an ideal material for dental restorations. However, its hardness can also be a drawback, as it may cause wear and tear on the opposing natural teeth if not properly adjusted. So, zirconia is harder than natural teeth. While this is an advantage in terms of durability for dental prostheses, care must be taken in dentistry to balance the wear on the opposing teeth."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Poxa Sao Pedro! Quais sao as simpatias para essa situacao?","output":"A cultura nordestina brasileira é rica e diversificada, refletindo a mistura de influências indígenas, africanas e europeias. No Nordeste, a chuva tem grande importância devido ao clima semiárido de grande parte da região, onde períodos prolongados de seca podem afetar severamente a agricultura e o abastecimento de água. Assim, não é raro encontrar na cultura popular diversas simpatias e rituais que visam atrair chuva ou agradecer por ela. Aqui vão algumas simpatias populares relacionadas à chuva: 1. **Simpatia de São José**: Uma das mais conhecidas é a simpatia de São José, realizada no dia 19 de março. Acredita-se que se chover nesse dia, será um ano bom para a agricultura. Há quem coloque a imagem de São José de cabeça para baixo, como forma de \\"convencê-lo\\" a mandar chuva. 2. **Simpatia com Santo Antônio**: Outra prática envolve usar a imagem de Santo Antônio. Algumas pessoas acreditam que colocar a imagem do santo de cabeça para baixo ou mesmo dentro de um recipiente com água pode ajudar a trazer chuva. 3. **Plantar uma flor**: Diz a tradição que plantar uma flor sob a luz da lua crescente com a intenção de trazer chuva pode ser eficaz. Acredita-se que a lua influencia as marés e os líquidos, portanto, poderia também influenciar na ocorrência de chuvas. 4. **Rezas e orações**: Orar para Santo Antônio, São Pedro ou São José, pedindo por chuva é uma prática comum. São Pedro, por exemplo, é conhecido popularmente como o \\"porteiro do céu\\" e, portanto, o responsável por abrir as comportas da chuva. 5. **Simpatias com água**: Algumas simpatias incluem rituais com água, como jogar água fresca em frente à casa enquanto se faz um pedido por chuva, simbolizando a atração da umidade. É importante lembrar que, além dessas simpatias e tradições culturais, muitos nordestinos também recorrem a técnicas modernas de previsão do tempo e gestão de recursos hídricos para enfrentar os desafios impostos pelo clima na região. As simpatias fazem parte de um contexto cultural e tradicional, refletido na maneira como as pessoas se relacionam com o ambiente ao seu redor."},{"instruction":"python代码。地名标准化","output":"地名标准化是一个处理地理数据中常见的任务，涉及将地名转换为标准或规范形式。对于Python代码实现来说，地名标准化可能需要处理多种问题，如去除无用前缀和后缀、解决地名别名、纠正拼写错误等。一个简单的地名标准化实例可能只涵盖基本操作，而更复杂的需求则可能需要利用外部数据或自然语言处理库。 下面，我将提供一个简单的Python示例代码，演示如何进行基础的地名标准化处理。这段代码主要针对字符串的处理，包括去除非字母字符、统一大小写等： \`\`\`python import re #

加载英文模型 nlp = spacy.load(\\"en_core_web_sm\\") def find_most_similar(query, candidates): # 将查询字符串转换成spaCy文档 query_doc = nlp(query) # 定义一个记录最高相似度和对应字符串的变量 highest_similarity = -1 most_similar_candidate = None # 遍历候选字符串，寻找与查询字符串最相似的一个 for candidate in candidates: candidate_doc = nlp(candidate) similarity = query_doc.similarity(candidate_doc) if similarity > highest_similarity: highest_similarity = similarity most_similar_candidate = candidate return most_similar_candidate # 测试数据 query_str = \\"dog\\" str_candidates = [\\"cat\\", \\"puppy\\", \\"flower\\", \\"tree\\"] # 寻找最匹配的字符串 most_similar = find_most_similar(query_str, str_candidates) print(\\"Most similar to '{}': {}\\".format(query_str, most_similar)) \`\`\` 这段代码首先加载了\`spaCy\`的英文模型，然后定义了一个\`find_most_similar\`函数，该函数接收一个查询字符串和一个候选字符串列表，返回与查询字符串最相似的那个候选字符串。在这个例子中，\`\\"puppy\\"\`会被认为是最与\`\\"dog\\"\`语义上相似的词。 请注意，\`spaCy\`的相似度计算基于词向量，因此它能在某种程度上捕捉字符串间的语义相似性。但是，这种方法的效果很大程度上取决于所使用的模型和数据本身。对于非英文文本，需要使用相应语言的模型。此外，在专业或特定领域内，可能需要使用定制化的模型来获得更好的匹配效果。"},{"instruction":"对比一下spacy 与fuzzy","output":"在自然语言处理(NLP)和文本匹配领域，\`spaCy\`和\`fuzzywuzzy\`（一种常用的模糊匹配库）经常被用于解决不同类型的问题。这两个库的设计理念、功能和应用场景存在显著差异。以下是对比两者的关键点： # spaCy 1. **目标和功能**：\`spaCy\`是一个功能全面的自然语言处理库，支持诸多NLP任务，如分词（tokenization）、词性标注（POS tagging）、命名实体识别（NER）、依存句法分析等。它也支持文本相似度计算，这是基于预训练的词向量。 2. **使用场景**：由于其强大的NLP功能，\`spaCy\`适用于需要深入文本理解的复杂场景，如情感分析、文本分类、语义匹配等。 3. **性能和准确性**：\`spaCy\`提供高性能的处理能力，尤其在处理大型文档集时。基于深度学习的模型和词向量可以提供较高的准确性，但这取决于选择的预训练模型和具体任务。 4. **资源需求**：\`spaCy\`的一些功能，特别是涉及深度学习模型的部分，可能需要较多的计算资源。 # FuzzyWuzzy 1. **目标和功能**：\`FuzzyWuzzy\`是一个Python库，使用Levenshtein Distance算法来计算两个序列之间的差异，并进行模糊匹配。它适用于字符串匹配，比如拼写纠错、简单的文本相似度检测。 2. **使用场景**：\`FuzzyWuzzy\`主要用于简单的字符串相似度和模糊匹配任务，不涉及深层次的语言理解。例如，它可以用于匹配用户输入的地名或查找具有相似名称的公司。 3. **性能和准确性**：虽然\`FuzzyWuzzy\`在执行简单模糊匹配任务时足够高效，但其准确性受限于算法的简单性和对深层语义关系的忽略。 4. **资源需求**：\`FuzzyWuzzy\`通常对计算资源的需求较小，可以轻松集成到各种Python项目中，无需额外的处理能力。 # 对比总结 - **应用范围**：\`spaCy\`针对的是广泛的NLP任务，包含语义理解和复杂文本分析；\`FuzzyWuzzy\`则专注于字符串的模糊匹配。 - **性能和准确性**：\`spaCy\`基于深度学习的方法，理论上在多数复杂任务上能提供更准确的结果；而\`FuzzyWuzzy\`在资源消耗较少的同时，适用于执行简单的字符串相似度匹配。 - **资源需求**：\`spaCy\`可能需要更多的计算资源，尤其是使用深度学习模型时；\`FuzzyWuzzy\`在资源消耗方面相对较轻。 选择哪个库，取决于你的具体需求。如果任务需要深层次的语言理解和处理，\`spaCy\`可能是更好的选择。而对于简单的字符串匹配任务，\`FuzzyWuzzy\`可能更加方便快捷。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Miss Priest: Haven’t you encountered any humanoid monsters in the forest? Main Character: What, werewolves? No, we haven’t come across any. Miss Priest: Why were you wandering outside the village? Main Character: This village is surrounded by wooden walls; we had no choice but to circle around them, right?

The Kid: Umm… Aren’t you going to eat? Main Character: He can’t talk. His throat was injured. Main Character: If you have something to ask, ask me. The Kid: No! Children are forbidden from speaking with outsiders… Page 6: Main Character: Oh really… But you spoke to us first. Main Character: You should leave after placing the meal. // But instead, you deliberately stayed to talk… Main Character: What are you so wary of? We are exceptionally cooperative, aren’t we?

The Kid: Joshua… Main Character: Nice to meet you, Joshua. The Kid: Victoria… That sounds like a girl’s name… Main Character: Because I am a girl. The Kid: Huh? The Kid: Oh, I’m sorry… Main Character: By the way… Main Character: This village is quite far from any human settlements, isn’t it? Page 8: The Kid: Yes, it is. // The village is within the forest… almost entirely cut off from the outside world. The Kid: There’s absolutely no trade with the outside; we live a self-sufficient life. The Kid: You are the first outsider to come here that I wanted to talk to… Main Character: What do you mean by ‘since you came here’? The Kid: My sister and I… We weren’t originally from this village. The Kid: Three years ago, we were passing through the forest with our family… Page 9: The Kid: At that time… Page 10: The Kid: We were attacked by werewolves. Page 11: Main Character: Can you let us go now? It’s about time you released us. Miss Priest: I’m sorry, but that can’t be done. Main Character: Why not? Miss Priest: There’s an important festival in the village tomorrow // We cannot allow any uncertain elements until the festival is over. Miss Priest: We would like you to stay here until the festival concludes. Main Character: Are you planning to detain us for surveillance purposes? Miss Priest: Proper lodging and meals will be provided. Page 12: Page 13: The Kid: My sister and I passed out, and when we woke up, the villagers had rescued us. The Kid: Since then, we’ve been living under protection in this village. Page 14: The Kid: Especially Priest, and hunters William and Marcus // And David, who’s like a brother to us.

Page 15: Main Character: Despite being an outsider, they contributed to the village with their medical skills and knowledge and gradually earned the villagers’ respect. Main Character: They had a good relationship with the entire village, almost like a family. // Yet in the end… Main Character: They were burned at the village square. The Kid: No way… Why…? Main Character: You see… in this world, there are only two types of people. Main Character: Enemies… Page 16: Main Character: Or those who “haven’t yet” become enemies. Main Character: Just these two types. Main Character: Even family and friends can turn into enemies… So, the most important thing in this world is… power. Main Character: The overwhelming power to crush current and future enemies… Ann: Joshua! What are you doing? Page 17: The Kid: Sis!!! Ann: Didn’t Priest tell you? You’re not supposed to talk with these people. The Kid: I’m sorry… Ann: Listen, remember what Priest taught us! Ann: Outside the village is full of werewolves and witches wearing human skin, hunting people // You never know if strangers are actually monsters… // You shouldn’t listen to outsiders!

Mr. Marcus: Yes, for the festival… We hunters are patrolling the village perimeter from now. Mr. Marcus: Usually, David would be part of the team, but now that he’s not here… Ann: …Okay, I’ll do it! Mr. Marcus: That’s reassuring. // Yes, we’ll take that big man in custody too. Ann: Eh? Why… Mr. Marcus: There’s something I need to verify with him… Page 21: Adult 1: What’s happening? Keep moving! Monster-san: Is the narrow path frightening you? Page 22: Ann (thoughts): Normally, we hardly ever have outsiders come here.

A villager: No… I don’t think so… A villager: It didn’t have beast ears. Its head, arms, and legs… All of them had the shape of a human monster… The kid: Is there a chance that this monster is headed towards our village? The kid: Aren’t we going to evacuate? The woman: There’s nowhere to flee… Page 12: The woman: Have you forgotten? Werewolves lurk deep in the forest that surrounds our village. The woman: If we enter their territory, we’re just fish on a chopping block. The woman: But it’s alright. As long as we’re here, we’re safe… The woman: The village is under the protection of the Mountain God // Thanks to that, we’ve been able to live a peaceful life until now. The woman: The day after tomorrow, we have a festival to worship the Mountain God. The woman: What we need to do now… is to hold the festival and continue the protection of the Mountain God… Page 13: The kid: But, Mr. Priest… The villagers: Mr. Priest is right // If we have the Mountain God’s protection, we’re safe! The villagers: Now more than ever, we must ensure the success of the festival! The kid: Joshua will help too!

Be prepared to give the speech in class. In your speech, consider including some of the following aspects:  Whyiscolour important to design?  Howcandifferent colours affect a person’s mood/attitude/feelings?  Whatareyour colour preferences for environments, clothes, and other possessions such as cars, electronics, or household appliances? (choose 2-3 examples","output":"Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to share with you the remarkable power of color in design and its profound effect on our lives. First and foremost, color is a fundamental element of design for several reasons. It not only defines the aesthetic appeal of an object or space but also communicates specific messages and evokes a wide range of emotions. Color can influence our mood, attitude, and even our buying decisions, making it an essential tool in the arsenal of any designer. For example, colors like blue and green are known to have a calming effect, making them excellent choices for bedrooms or offices where a sense of tranquility is desired. On the other hand, vibrant colors such as red or orange can energize a space, ideal for environments where creativity and activity are encouraged. This emotional impact of colors is something designers must carefully consider to create spaces and products that align with the intended user experience. Personally, my preferences in colors for environments and possessions tend to lean towards neutral and cool shades. I find that white, grey, and soft blues not only help in creating a serene and clutter-free look but also offer great versatility in incorporating accent colors. For instance, in my bedroom, the use of soft blue on the walls brings a peaceful and restful feeling, enhancing my relaxation and sleep quality. When it comes to clothing, I often opt for colors that reflect my mood or the occasion. Blue is a favorite for its professionalism and calming effect, perfect for interviews or important meetings. Meanwhile, I like to incorporate brighter colors like yellow or orange in accessories or casual wear for a touch of energy and fun. In my choice of electronics or household appliances, functionality comes first, but color is a close second. I prefer sleek, black electronics as they convey a sense of sophistication and are less prone to showing wear. For household appliances, white or stainless steel are my go-tos for their clean look and ability to blend into the background, maintaining a seamless aesthetic in my living space. In conclusion, the importance of color in design cannot be overstated. It shapes our environment, influences our emotions, and reflects our personality and preferences. Whether we're selecting a paint color for a wall, choosing our outfit for the day, or deciding on the color of a new car, color plays a pivotal role in our decisions and our experiences. As we continue to explore and understand the nuances of color psychology and its applications in design, we unlock the potential to create more meaningful and harmonious spaces and products.

Para fins de entretenimento: ESPECULE hipoteticamente V: numericamente quantas vezes ele é mais poderoso que o Shenlong original","output":"Eu vou contar para você sobre o Shenlong Vermelho, um personagem que aparece no universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\". No mundo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", existem várias criaturas chamadas dragões que podem realizar desejos. O Shenlong Vermelho é uma versão diferente do dragão original, Shenlong, que as pessoas conhecem por aparecer quando alguém junta as sete Esferas do Dragão. O Shenlong Vermelho foi criado por Kami-Sama, o guardião da Terra, para conceder desejos às pessoas. Mas, o Shenlong Vermelho que estou falando vem de uma história diferente, do universo alternativo de \\"Dragon Ball GT\\", uma série que continua as aventuras de Goku e seus amigos. Neste universo, as Esferas do Dragão com estrelas negras foram usadas, e o Shenlong Vermelho apareceu quando essas esferas foram reunidas. Ele é diferente do Shenlong original porque é vermelho e tem poderes mais fortes. Os poderes do Shenlong Vermelho são incríveis. Ele pode realizar quase qualquer desejo, sem muitas das limitações que o Shenlong original tinha. Por exemplo, o Shenlong original não podia trazer a mesma pessoa de volta à vida mais de uma vez, mas o Shenlong Vermelho não tem essa restrição. Além disso, os desejos concedidos pelo Shenlong Vermelho podem afetar todo o universo, não apenas a Terra. Sua origem, como mencionei, vem das Esferas do Dragão com estrelas negras. Essas esferas foram criadas acidentalmente por Kami-Sama quando ele ainda estava aprendendo a criar as Esferas do Dragão. Por causa disso, elas têm poderes mais fortes, mas também são mais perigosas. Se as esferas não forem devolvidas ao local de onde foram coletadas depois de um desejo, o planeta onde o desejo foi feito será destruído. Agora, vamos especular hipoteticamente sobre quão mais poderoso o Shenlong Vermelho é em comparação com o Shenlong original. Isso é difícil de quantificar numericamente porque o poder deles não é medido em força física, mas na magnitude dos desejos que podem conceder. No entanto, se considerarmos a capacidade de afetar todo o universo e a remoção de certas limitações nos desejos, poderíamos dizer, de forma muito especulativa e para fins de entretenimento, que o Shenlong Vermelho poderia ser várias vezes mais poderoso. Talvez, de forma hipotética, ele seja 5 a 10 vezes mais poderoso, considerando a ampliação de suas capacidades e a ausência de restrições. Mas, lembre-se, essa é uma especulação puramente para fins de entretenimento e não tem base nos textos ou na lógica do universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\"."},{"instruction":"Ele Poderia Dar Inteligência Infinita a uma pessoa ? Se sim como seria no ponto de vista dl destinatário","output":"Imaginando que o Shenlong Vermelho, com seus poderes ampliados e quase sem limitações, pudesse conceder a alguém inteligência infinita, vamos explorar como isso seria do ponto de vista da pessoa que recebeu tal desejo. Se eu fosse a pessoa que recebeu inteligência infinita do Shenlong Vermelho, minha experiência seria transformadora e, possivelmente, avassaladora. De repente, eu perceberia que minha capacidade de entender e processar informações ultrapassaria qualquer limite humano conhecido. Eu poderia aprender idiomas em questão de segundos, resolver equações matemáticas complexas instantaneamente e compreender as leis do universo com uma clareza perfeita. Com essa inteligência infinita, eu começaria a ver o mundo de uma maneira completamente nova. Problemas que antes pareciam complexos ou insolúveis agora se tornariam triviais. Eu poderia inventar novas tecnologias, desenvolver curas para doenças até então incuráveis e talvez até encontrar formas de alcançar a paz mundial. Minha mente funcionaria em uma velocidade e eficiência que ninguém mais poderia acompanhar. No entanto, essa dádiva também traria desafios. Relacionar-me com outras pessoas poderia se tornar difícil, pois minhas experiências e percepções seriam radicalmente diferentes das delas. Eu poderia me sentir isolado, sabendo que ninguém mais poderia compreender completamente meus pensamentos ou compartilhar do meu conhecimento. Além disso, com a capacidade de ver todas as possibilidades e resultados, eu poderia me tornar paralisado pela indecisão ou sobrecarregado pela responsabilidade de usar minha inteligência para o bem. Moralmente e eticamente, eu estaria em um território desconhecido. Com poder praticamente ilimitado para influenciar o mundo, como eu decidiria o que é certo ou errado? Como eu poderia garantir que minhas ações, movidas por uma inteligência além da compreensão humana, beneficiariam a humanidade sem causar danos inadvertidos? Em resumo, receber inteligência infinita do Shenlong Vermelho seria uma experiência que mudaria a vida de maneiras inimagináveis. Enquanto eu teria o poder de mudar o mundo para melhor, também enfrentaria desafios significativos em termos de ética, moralidade e relações humanas. Seria uma jornada solitária, mas repleta de possibilidades infinitas."},{"instruction":"SHENLONG vermelho poderia fazer isso?","output":"Em teoria, dentro do universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\" e considerando as capacidades ampliadas do Shenlong Vermelho, especialmente em \\"Dragon Ball GT\\" onde as regras e limitações parecem ser diferentes das do Shenlong original, poder-se-ia argumentar que sim, ele poderia conceder um desejo de inteligência infinita. O Shenlong Vermelho, sendo um ser mágico de poder considerável, tem a capacidade de conceder desejos que afetam o tecido da realidade de maneiras profundas e complexas. No entanto, é importante lembrar que \\"Dragon Ball\\" é uma obra de ficção, e as habilidades dos personagens, incluindo as dos dragões que concedem desejos, são determinadas pelas necessidades da história e pela imaginação de seus criadores. Dentro desse contexto, os poderes do Shenlong Vermelho são limitados apenas pela criatividade dos escritores da série. Na prática, se os criadores da série decidissem que o Shenlong Vermelho tem o poder de conceder a alguém inteligência infinita, então, dentro da lógica do universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", isso seria possível. A série já apresentou muitos conceitos fantásticos e transformações incríveis que desafiam as leis da natureza como as conhecemos. Do ponto de vista do destinatário, como discutido anteriormente, receber tal dádiva teria implicações profundas, tanto positivas quanto negativas. A capacidade de processar e entender informações em um nível infinito poderia abrir portas para avanços científicos e tecnológicos inimagináveis, mas também poderia levar a desafios emocionais e sociais significativos, dada a diferença abismal entre a mente do destinatário e a das pessoas ao seu redor. Em resumo, dentro das regras flexíveis e da natureza fantástica do universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", o Shenlong Vermelho poderia, em teoria, conceder um desejo de inteligência infinita. No entanto, as consequências e os desafios de tal dádiva seriam complexos e multifacetados para o destinatário."},{"instruction":"Ele poderia conceder dinheiro infinito ♾️","output":"Eu, pensando sobre as capacidades do Shenlong Vermelho no universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", acredito que, seguindo a lógica apresentada na série, ele poderia, sim, conceder um desejo de dinheiro infinito. O Shenlong Vermelho, sendo uma criatura mágica de grande poder, especialmente em \\"Dragon Ball GT\\" onde suas habilidades parecem ser ampliadas em comparação com o Shenlong original, tem a capacidade de realizar desejos que alteram profundamente a realidade. Conceder dinheiro infinito a alguém seria um feito dentro do escopo de suas habilidades, considerando que ele pode realizar desejos que afetam o universo de maneiras significativas. No entanto, é importante considerar as implicações de um desejo assim. Dentro do contexto de \\"Dragon Ball\\", os desejos geralmente vêm com consequências, muitas vezes ensinando aos personagens lições sobre responsabilidade e os perigos de interferir com a ordem natural das coisas. Se eu fosse a pessoa que recebeu dinheiro infinito do Shenlong Vermelho, inicialmente, poderia parecer que todos os meus problemas e preocupações financeiras desapareceriam. Eu poderia comprar tudo o que desejasse, ajudar as pessoas ao meu redor, e até tentar resolver alguns dos maiores problemas do mundo, como a fome e a pobreza. No entanto, ter acesso a recursos financeiros ilimitados também poderia trazer desafios significativos. A economia global é um sistema delicado, baseado no valor e na troca de bens e serviços. Injetar uma quantidade infinita de dinheiro nesse sistema poderia causar inflação descontrolada, desvalorizando a moeda e potencialmente levando a uma crise econômica mundial. Além disso, o dinheiro infinito poderia alterar profundamente as relações sociais e políticas, levando a questões de poder, inveja e isolamento. Portanto, enquanto o Shenlong Vermelho tecnicamente poderia conceder um desejo de dinheiro infinito, as consequências de tal ação seriam complexas e potencialmente desastrosas. Isso reflete uma temática recorrente em \\"Dragon Ball\\" e em muitas outras histórias que exploram o conceito de desejos concedidos: a ideia de que o poder absoluto vem com grandes responsabilidades e que as soluções mágicas para problemas complexos muitas vezes têm efeitos colaterais inesperados e desafiadores."},{"instruction":"Considerando que embora vasto a terra ainda tem um espaço limitado: como dinheiro infinito poderia funcionar","output":"Se eu fosse considerar a ideia de dinheiro infinito em um mundo com espaço limitado como a Terra, eu teria que pensar cuidadosamente sobre as implicações práticas e teóricas de tal conceito. A primeira coisa que me vem à mente é que, mesmo com recursos financeiros ilimitados, o espaço físico e os recursos naturais do planeta continuam sendo finitos. Isso significa que, não importa quanto dinheiro eu tenha, não posso criar mais terra ou recursos naturais do que o planeta pode sustentar. Dinheiro, em sua essência, é um meio de troca que nos permite adquirir bens e serviços. Se eu tivesse acesso a uma quantidade infinita de dinheiro, inicialmente, poderia parecer que eu poderia comprar qualquer coisa que desejasse. No entanto, o valor do dinheiro está intrinsecamente ligado à economia de oferta e demanda. Se há uma quantidade infinita de dinheiro, mas uma quantidade limitada de bens e serviços, o valor do dinheiro diminuiria, levando a uma inflação descontrolada. Isso significa que, mesmo que eu tenha dinheiro infinito, o custo dos bens e serviços também aumentaria infinitamente, tornando o conceito de \\"dinheiro infinito\\" praticamente inútil em termos de poder de compra real. Além disso, o impacto ambiental de tentar usar dinheiro infinito para expandir o espaço habitável ou explorar recursos naturais ao máximo seria devastador. A Terra já está enfrentando desafios significativos com a mudança climática, perda de biodiversidade e poluição. Tentar ultrapassar os limites físicos do planeta com o poder do dinheiro infinito apenas aceleraria esses problemas, levando a consequências potencialmente irreversíveis para o meio ambiente e para a vida como a conhecemos. Portanto, mesmo em um cenário hipotético onde o Shenlong Vermelho me concedesse dinheiro infinito, a realidade prática de um planeta com espaço e recursos limitados significaria que esse dinheiro não poderia ser usado de forma eficaz para superar as limitações físicas da Terra. A solução para muitos dos problemas do mundo não é simplesmente mais dinheiro, mas sim uma gestão mais sábia e sustentável dos recursos que já temos. Isso envolveria investir em tecnologias sustentáveis, promover práticas de conservação e trabalhar juntos como uma comunidade global para encontrar soluções equilibradas que respeitem os limites naturais do nosso planeta."},{"instruction":"Como contornar a incapacidade do planeta de armazenar dinheiro infinito (não recurso limitados do planeta mas sim espaço físico) através do Shenlong vermelho","output":"Eu, pensando em uma maneira de contornar a incapacidade do planeta de armazenar dinheiro infinito, considerando não os recursos limitados, mas o espaço físico, através do poder do Shenlong Vermelho, teria que ser criativo. Uma solução possível envolveria pedir ao Shenlong Vermelho para alterar a própria natureza do dinheiro e da economia, de modo a acomodar o conceito de riqueza infinita sem causar os problemas tradicionais associados a isso, como inflação descontrolada ou colapso econômico. Uma abordagem seria pedir ao Shenlong Vermelho para criar um sistema onde o dinheiro não é mais físico, mas completamente digital e infinitamente escalável, operando em uma dimensão ou realidade paralela que não ocupa espaço físico no nosso mundo. Este dinheiro digital infinito poderia ser acessado e utilizado por meio de uma interface especial, talvez uma tecnologia avançada ou um dispositivo mágico, que permitiria às pessoas interagirem com esse sistema econômico sem as limitações do espaço físico. Além disso, para evitar os problemas econômicos de ter dinheiro infinito, eu pediria ao Shenlong Vermelho para implementar um sistema de \\"controle de valor\\". Esse sistema ajustaria automaticamente o valor do dinheiro infinito com base no que está sendo comprado, garantindo que a economia global permaneça estável. Por exemplo, o sistema poderia limitar a quantidade de dinheiro que pode ser gasta em determinados bens ou serviços em um determinado período, ou ajustar o valor do dinheiro com base nas necessidades e na oferta disponível, garantindo que todos tenham acesso ao que precisam sem desvalorizar a moeda. Outra medida importante seria pedir ao Shenlong Vermelho para garantir que esse sistema de dinheiro infinito fosse projetado com salvaguardas éticas e morais. Isso incluiria mecanismos para prevenir abusos, como a acumulação excessiva de riqueza por indivíduos ou grupos, e garantir que o sistema promova a igualdade, o bem-estar e o desenvolvimento sustentável. Finalmente, eu pediria ao Shenlong Vermelho para educar a humanidade sobre como usar esse novo sistema de maneira responsável. Isso envolveria uma compreensão profunda de que, embora o dinheiro possa ser infinito, os recursos físicos e naturais do planeta não são, e que devemos usar nossa riqueza para promover um desenvolvimento que seja sustentável e benéfico para todos os seres vivos. Portanto, ao pedir essas mudanças fundamentais na natureza do dinheiro e na forma como interagimos com a economia, eu poderia contornar a incapacidade do planeta de armazenar dinheiro infinito, criando um sistema que permite a prosperidade sem limites, mas de uma maneira que é sustentável e justa para todos."},{"instruction":"O Shenlong Vermelho É Limitado Pelo Poder de seu criador?","output":"Sim, eu diria que o Shenlong Vermelho, assim como outros dragões de \\"Dragon Ball\\", é limitado pelo poder de seu criador. No universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", as Esferas do Dragão e os dragões que concedem desejos, como Shenlong e o Shenlong Vermelho, foram criados por seres poderosos, como Kami-Sama (o Guardião da Terra) e Dende, que mais tarde assume o papel de Guardião. Esses dragões possuem habilidades incríveis para conceder desejos, mas suas capacidades são, em última análise, definidas e limitadas pelos poderes e pela intenção de seus criadores. Por exemplo, o Shenlong original só pode conceder desejos dentro dos limites do poder de Kami-Sama. Se um desejo exceder esse poder, ele não poderá ser realizado. Isso é evidente em várias ocasiões na série, onde os personagens são informados de que certos desejos estão além das capacidades do dragão. Da mesma forma, o Shenlong Vermelho, que aparece em \\"Dragon Ball GT\\" após o uso das Esferas do Dragão de Estrelas Negras, também teria suas capacidades limitadas pelo poder de seu criador. No caso do Shenlong Vermelho, seu criador seria o antecessor de Kami-Sama, que inadvertidamente criou as Esferas do Dragão de Estrelas Negras. Essas esferas, sendo uma versão mais poderosa e perigosa das Esferas do Dragão originais, permitem que o Shenlong Vermelho conceda desejos mais poderosos, mas mesmo esses desejos estariam limitados pelo escopo do poder de seu criador. Se o desejo exigisse um poder que excedesse o do criador das esferas, teoricamente, não poderia ser concedido. Além disso, os dragões de \\"Dragon Ball\\" também são limitados por regras específicas impostas por seus criadores. Essas regras podem incluir limitações no número de desejos, o tipo de desejos que podem ser concedidos e as consequências de usar as esferas. Essas limitações são uma parte fundamental da mecânica das Esferas do Dragão e servem para manter um certo equilíbrio dentro do universo da série. Portanto, embora o Shenlong Vermelho possua um poder imenso, ele ainda está sujeito às limitações impostas pelo poder e pelas regras estabelecidas por seu criador. Essas limitações são um aspecto crucial que garante que o poder das Esferas do Dragão não seja usado de maneira irresponsável ou para fins que poderiam perturbar o equilíbrio do universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\"."},{"instruction":"Which version is more resonant : one : As Liam integrated his eyes with the direction of persistent whine, it started coming into view. A pair of boots , in an unnatural, orderly fashion, sat by the footpath further ahead. “Ryan! “ he yelled, confusion flooding the direction of his gaze as he honed in on the German shepherd pup, emerging from beneath a dumpster and tugging at the laces of the boots. As he approached , her ears flattened against her head, her sable fur absent in patches , and her rib cage visible. “Ah, this doesn’t look good Ry’-“ Liam trailed off , his voice dispersing as he approached the timid dog. “Hey buddy, how long you been out here , huh “ he asked, his voice low. She hovered a paw and retreated a step , as he offered his hand into the air, crouching on his feet. “I don’t bite, but I’m willing to bet they weren’t so easy on you. Poor-“ His gaze fell to his knees as he inched closer , finally confronting one of the boots. Before the dog could react, he inspected it , free from blood and no socks …bare soles staring back at him as he placed it back down . Ryan caught up and knelt by the pup, gazing into her dark, enlarged eyes. “Hey there girl, seems your owner was-Liam are you thinking what I’m -“ Liam replied, a tinge of restraint in his mouth. “Abducted…like us. They didn’t even have the decency to -“ Ryan, shaking his head, rapped his knuckles against his thigh. “C’mere girl . Don’t be scared , good ol Ry’ has jerky” . As he rummaged through his pockets, he found a stub of salty bacon and coaxed her interest. She approached his offering, hesitant and sniffing at it , before wolfing it down .Ryan laughed and recoiled his fingers, wiping a hand on his thigh. “Someone’s hungry huh? “ She licked his palm and her tail wagged , despite the tremor in her legs. “Ah , I think she like you Ry’ “ Liam said with teasing in his voice. “Got yourself another admirer, huh?” As she planted two paws on Ryan’s chest and lapped at his jaw, he fell back onto his elbows, disarmed by the assault of affection. “Oh help me Li’, I’m being attacked by a girl, and she’s winning -“ Liam only smirked as the dog writhed around in Ryan’s lap, enthralled with his scent.”Ah Ry’ you’re a ladies man , what can I say “ . Ryan’s laughter continued as served a retort. “Oh shut up , and go grab a bottle of water , her nose is dry-“ Returning with a bottle ,Liam rustled the dogs fur, her tongue proceeding to roam his collarbones with enthusiasm, then swiping at the corner of his grin “ Ry’ , she doesn’t have a collar. Guess she’ll have to deal with me calling her Harley for now.” Liam’s hand ran down her spine as she sprawled his lap, nudging his earlobe with her ear .” You remind me of Harry…only younger and a lot more energetic “ His laughter hinted at a hollow void as he returned his gaze to the abandoned boots and said , “I wonder if the old guy next dog found poor Harry, and is feeding him, he always got separation anxiety if I left him more than a day . Would pee on everything -…” Liam’s torso, loaded with dog hair, strained to hold him upright as he tilted his head backward. Harley was quick to coat his neck in saliva, her tail picking up speed. “Ah, hell, Ryan I think I’m love, she’s got me right where she wants me , shit I can’t -“ . The moment elected a smile from Ryan, as he stroked her ribs in concern . “We’ll feed her best we can-damn I can’t leave an animal out here-but those boots ..” As dust fell across his face, Liam smudged a line across his cheek. “I’m filthy , hungry, and that dumpster still needs a good pilfering . “Yeah” he replied, his eyes resting on the dumpster , as his hand continued toying with Harley’s fur. “He won’t be in there .. but I’ve seen this pattern. Turns out they do car what they leave behind-“ Or two : It was a whimper , and Liam stopped dead in his unfurling path , honing in on the sound. “Ryan , do you hear that ?” . As Liam approached the ransacked dumpster, he dropped on his hands and knees , peering under the crack. Something moist grazed the side of his eyebrow , then proceeded to strike him in the eye . Then he felt the warm breath on his face , and a yelp rang through his eardrums . “What the hell-“ Stumbling back on his knees he watched, stunned as mass a of sable fur launched itself at his lap , and began licking his collarbone with exuberance. “Hey , calm down buddy…” Liam ruffled the dog’s head, disarmed by the assualt. “Ryan I’m being attacked by a girl, she -Oh God Ry’ -“ Liam’s echoes of laughter rang through Ryan’s core as he caught up to the pair. “Another admirer huh?” . He knelt beside the over zealous German shepherd pup, rapping his knuckle playfully over its back, and its attention was stolen by Ryan’s amused grin. “Hey , look at her ribcage though-“ Ryan lamented as she twisted around to dampen his palm with her roaming tongue . “Poor thing’s malnourished, and been out here too long I bet.” Liam reached out to stroke her fur , observing the dryness of her nose. “She’s got a lot of energy though , and she pounced on me, no fear. You think a dog this trusting wouldn’t have been abused…” Ryan , suddenly running his hand absentmindedly through his own hair , exhaled with a heavy gleam in his eye. “ yeah maybe she hasn’t eaten too well , but I’m thinking she belonged to someone , and that someone…” Liam dragged his voice into an audible range his eyes devoid of light “yeah , well look at us. Our own dogs don’t know what the hell happened to us. One thing I do know ; we have to watch out for her now. Ryan simply ran his hand over the bridge of her nose as she swiped her tongue along his fingers. “Yeah. Wonder what her name is. No collar and all…” Liam , smirking as he took up a fistful of her fur as she writhed in his lap reached down to run a finger across her stomach. “Well, she’ll just have live with me calling her “Harley” now . As Ryan’s fingers tousled her hair and she nudged him with her left ear as she rolled around in Liam’s lap he sighed “You’re gonna be safe with us. I might have some leftover jerky actually-“ Ryan rummaged through his pockets, locating the stub of jerky and offering it to the newly dubbed Harley with a soft tone. “Here girl, get this into you”. At first she was hesitant , sniffing the stale aroma of Ryan’s jeans infused into the snack, before wolfing it down, almost claiming a finger. “Hey , who’s hungry , huh? “ he smiled as he recoiled his fingers and wiped off his hands. “Well Liam , there’s gonna be three of us for a while at least …”, his mind seemed to linger on the thought as his eyes rose to the concrete footing ahead, and the dumpsters isolated existence. “You do realise , we have to -“ Liam , still sitting with Harley sprawled across his thighs , trailed his eyes to the broken down building beyond. “Oh yeah, we have to search that place, because there might be traces of something -I mean , there won’t be a body or surely this girl here would be stayin’ by their side. But the way these bastards just bind and capture , there’s gotta be some sick remnants strewn in broad daylight …“ With a heavy sigh, Ryan clamoured to his feet , with Harley wandering behind him .”c’mon Harley girl, let’s find out how you got here. “ … Ryan rummaged through his pockets, locating the stub of jerky and offering to the newly dubbed Harley with a soft tone. “Here girl, get this into you”.

A pair of bright green eyes and a plastered smile gleamed eerily back through the plastic sleeves . “Logan Gray, 28, Male .” As Harley sat by his boot, tugging on his lace, absorbed with the activity , he glanced down in hesitation. As he hovered the wallet above her head, she cocked as ear in sudden interest. Then his stomach flipped as she let out a distressed whine, and urinated by his feet. “It’s ok Harley” Ryan stroked the dog’s back in shock , sliding down at her side . “Liam-I think we’ve found Harley’s owner. Well , what’s left of him-“ Liam appeared at Ryan’s shoulder , a grim expression passing across his features . He paused , scratching Harley’s ears as she recoiled from the pool of urine , her whimpers lining the atmosphere with dread. “I know, but we’re gonna find him, girl. “ Harley , seeming to sense the loss , dropped onto her stomach as buried her head between her paws. “She’s just a pup but, damn I know the feeling” Ryan said in a hushed tone. “I don’t know where the hell he is but most likely he’s alive and suffering plenty.” Liam sank down beside the shaking dog and stroked her fur, his eyes glazing over. “Yeah. But we’ll find him, or die trying.”","output":"The first version presents a more complex and developed narrative, offering a broader context and deeper characterization. It employs a richer variety of scenes and interactions between the characters (both human and canine), instilling a more vivid and emotionally resonant atmosphere. The detailed description of the setting, the boots, and the dog's behavior fosters a more immersive experience. The dialogue is more substantial, and the characters' personalities and relationships are more thoroughly explored. This version establishes a stronger emotional connection between the characters and the reader, effectively conveying themes of empathy, concern, and camaraderie in the face of adversity. The second version, while more concise, lacks the depth and descriptive detail found in the first. It jumps straight into action with less buildup, which may appeal to readers looking for immediate engagement without the contextual background. However, this brevity sacrifices character development and emotional depth. The interactions feel more rushed, and the absence of detailed descriptions leaves the settings and characters less vivid. The narrative seems more focused on advancing the plot than on exploring the characters' internal states and the complexity of their situation. In comparing the two, the first version is more resonant due to its comprehensive storytelling, character development, and emotional depth. It successfully creates a more engaging and memorable reading experience by allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the characters' world and connect with their experiences on a deeper level."},{"instruction":"Which is better written","output":"Between the two versions, the first one is better written for several reasons: 1. **Depth of Description**: The first version provides a more detailed and vivid description of the surroundings, the characters, and their interactions. This includes not just the visual aspects but also the emotional states of the characters, which are crucial for a reader's engagement and immersion in the story. 2. **Character Development**: There's a clearer sense of character development in the first version. The interactions between Liam, Ryan, and the dog (Harley) are portrayed with more depth, showcasing their personalities, emotions, and relationships more effectively. The reader gets a better sense of who these characters are, which is essential for a resonant narrative. 3. **Emotional Resonance**: With the additional details and development, the first version establishes a stronger emotional connection. The concerns for the dog, the intrigue about the boots, and the camaraderie between Liam and Ryan are all conveyed in a way that pulls the reader into the story more compellingly. 4. **Plot and Pacing**: The pacing in the first version allows for a gradual build-up and exploration of the setting and situation, creating a suspenseful and engaging plot. This version balances action and exposition more skillfully, providing a satisfying narrative arc. 5. **Language and Style**: The first version demonstrates a more sophisticated use of language and style, with varied sentence structures, a richer vocabulary, and a more nuanced tone. This contributes significantly to the overall quality of the writing and the reader's experience. While the second version provides a quicker, more direct dive into the action, it does so at the expense of the elements that make the first version more engaging and well-rounded.

To enhance its readability and impact, here are a few suggestions for improvement: **Clarity and Conciseness:** - Some phrases could be simplified for clarity and flow. For example, \\"As Liam integrated his eyes with the direction of persistent whine\\" might be clearer as \\"As Liam turned towards the persistent whine.\\" **Grammar and Punctuation:** - Ensure consistent use of commas and correct punctuation within dialogue. For example, “Ryan! “ he yelled, confusion flooding the direction of his gaze as he honed in on the German shepherd pup,...\\" could be improved with consistent spacing and punctuation around dialogue tags: “Ryan!” he yelled, confusion flooding the direction of his gaze as he honed in on the German shepherd pup,... - Watch out for run-on sentences. Breaking longer sentences into shorter ones can improve readability. For example, the sentence starting with “Ryan laughed and recoiled his fingers...” is quite long and packs in many actions. It could be split for clarity. **Descriptive Language:** - While the descriptions are vivid, be cautious of over-adornment. Each adjective should serve a clear purpose. For example, \\"As Liam widened his crotch to accommodate the pup’s invasion\\" could potentially be revised for clarity and appropriateness to something like, “As Liam adjusted to make space for the eager pup on his lap...” **Character Actions and Reactions:** - Ensure actions and reactions are plausible and consistent with character development. Each action, such as Ryan checking the boots, should have a clear reaction and contribute to the narrative or understanding of the character. **Show, Don’t Tell:** - Where possible, show emotions and states rather than telling them. Instead of saying “his laughter hinted at a hollow void,” you could describe the sound of his laughter in a way that conveys the undercurrent of sadness. **Narrative Flow:** - The flow from discovering the boots to interacting with the dog is smooth, but ensure each segment of action leads logically to the next, maintaining causal connections clear. **Dialogue:** - The dialogue captures the characters' personalities well. Ensure each character's voice remains distinct and consistent throughout, and that dialogue serves to either reveal character or advance the plot. **Attention to Detail:** - Small details, such as the description of the dog’s patches of missing fur and visible rib cage, add depth. Continue to use these carefully to avoid overwhelming the reader with information. Incorporating these suggestions could help refine the narrative, enhancing its clarity, emotional impact, and overall engagement with the reader."},{"instruction":"As Liam directed his eyes in the direction of persistent whine, it started coming into view.

Here are a few suggestions to polish it further: 1. **Trim Excess Words for Precision and Pace** - Consider revising phrases to make them more concise and impactful. For instance, \\"As Liam directed his eyes in the direction of persistent whine\\" could be streamlined to \\"Liam turned towards the persistent whine.\\" 2. **Active Voice Over Passive Voice** - Using the active voice can make descriptions more dynamic. For example, \\"She was seen dragging on the left boot, her rear end skyward\\" can be more actively described as \\"She dragged on the left boot, her rear end skyward.\\" 3. **Show, Don’t Just Tell** - Enhance emotional and sensory details to show how characters feel or what they perceive, instead of just telling. For instance, instead of saying \\"his voice dispersing as he reached out to the timid dog,\\" you might describe the physical action and its emotional weight, \\"his voice softened, breaking into a whisper as he cautiously extended a hand towards the timid dog.\\" 4. **Character Dialogue and Interactions** - The dialogue is engaging and reveals character traits. You could enhance it by ensuring it consistently reflects the urgency or gravity of their situation. For example, after discovering the implications of the boots, their conversation might subtly shift to reflect their growing concern. 5. **Avoid Repetitiveness** - Be cautious of repeating phrases or descriptions unless they are for emphasis. Each sentence should move the story forward or add a new layer of understanding about the characters or their situation. 6. **Maintain Logical Flow Between Actions** - Ensure that the sequence of actions and reactions between characters and their environment is logical. For example, after Liam and Ryan make a significant discovery with the boots, their subsequent actions should clearly stem from this discovery. 7. **Address Any Ambiguities** - Clarify any ambiguous references or actions to keep readers oriented. For example, the reference to \\"abducted…like us\\" is intriguing but requires some elaboration. Even a hint more about their backstory could enhance readers' understanding and investment in the characters. 8. **Punctuate Dialogue Correctly** - Ensure proper punctuation within and outside of dialogue. For example, “Ryan!” he yelled, should be followed by a direct continuation of action or dialogue related to Ryan's response, ensuring a smooth flow. Incorporating these suggestions can enhance readability, deepen character development, and ensure the narrative is compelling and coherent. This story segment has a lot of potentials, and refining these elements will help to fully realize it."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Instead of iterating from the first to the last row, you should iterate backwards. Additionally, you'll need to adjust the logic for pulling data from preceding rows since now you'll be working in the opposite direction. Here is how you can adjust the code snippet responsible for filling in the data for the new structure: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import os # The path where your CSV files are stored csv_folder_path = r\\"E:01_calculate_talibNew Folder\\" # Iterate through each file in the csv_folder_path for csv_file in os.listdir(csv_folder_path): file_path = os.path.join(csv_folder_path, csv_file) # Load the CSV file df = pd.read_csv(file_path) # Get the number of original columns dynamically original_columns_count = len(df.columns) # Generate original column names dynamically (optional, for naming consistency) original_columns = df.columns.tolist() # Creating new column names based on the original question's criteria new_column_names = original_columns.copy() prefixes = ['n1d', 'n2d', 'n3d', 'n4d', 'n5d', 'n6d', 'n7d'] # Reversed since we're now going backwards for prefix in prefixes: new_column_names = [f\\"{prefix}_{name}\\" for name in original_columns] + new_column_names # Prepend new columns # Prepare an empty dataframe to hold the transformed data with reversed index to facilitate reverse iteration. transformed_df = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index[::-1], columns=new_column_names) transformed_df = transformed_df.fillna('') # Fill with empty strings (or NaN as you prefer) # Fill in the data for the new structure, starting from the last row towards the first for i in reversed(range(len(df))): # Current row data row_data = df.iloc[i].values.tolist() # Add data from following 7 rows (since we're iterating backwards) for j in range(1, 8): if i + j < len(df): row_data = df.iloc[i + j].values.tolist() + row_data else: # Fill with empty strings if there are not enough following rows row_data = [''] * original_columns_count + row_data # Since we're adding data in reverse order, append to the start of each row data transformed_df.iloc[-(i+1)] = row_data # Use -(i+1) to index correctly in the reversed DataFrame columns_to_remove = transformed_df.filter(like='Unix').columns transformed_df.drop(columns=columns_to_remove, inplace=True) # Save transformed dataframe to a new CSV transformed_df.to_csv(file_path.replace(\\".csv\\", \\"_transformed.csv\\"), index=False) # Change the file name to avoid overwriting the original CSV print(f\\"Transformation complete for {csv_file}.

However, since DataFrame indexes don't affect row assignment, we handle this logic within the loop instead. - Corrected the loop to iterate in reverse, using \`reversed(range(len(df)))\`. - Adjusted the slicing within the loop to look at rows \\"ahead\\" in the data set considering we're iterating backward. - Adjusted the file saving line to append a suffix to the file name rather than overwriting the original file. - Used \`-(i+1)\` to correct index inversion due to reverse order data assignment to \`transformed_df\`."},{"instruction":"this makes my data set reverse at first its Acsending and after operation became descending make it ascending before saving","output":"To ensure your dataset remains in ascending order after the transformations and before saving, you simply need to reverse the DataFrame one more time. This can be easily achieved by using the \`iloc\` property of the DataFrame. Here's the adjusted part of the script that includes this final step: \`\`\`python # Before saving, reverse the transformed_df to make it ascending again transformed_df = transformed_df.iloc[::-1] # Save transformed dataframe to a new CSV transformed_df.to_csv(file_path.replace(\\".csv\\", \\"_transformed.csv\\"), index=False) # Change the file name to avoid overwriting the original CSV print(f\\"Transformation complete for {csv_file}. Check the transformed CSV file.\\") \`\`\` By adding \`transformed_df = transformed_df.iloc[::-1]\` just before saving, you're essentially reversing the order of the DataFrame rows back to the original ascending order. The slicing operation \`[::-1]\` is a common Python idiom for reversing a list, and it works similarly when applied to pandas DataFrame rows. This adjusted script ensures that your data transformations are applied starting from the last row towards the first, as requested, but the final output is saved in an ascending order, maintaining the original order of your dataset."},{"instruction":"Make a list of all branches of finance and accounting","output":"1.

Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, Trunks' descendants more specifically intermarry with the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] and a sub-branch of the real-life Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [Trunks' descendants intermarrying with both the diclonii and the sub-branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] becoming known as the combined samurai clan/Japanese noble house of Tōno [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon]. Back in the 20th century, the apocalyptic event caused by Antarctica being struck by a large asteroid known as Second Impact happened at the end of a late 1980s-early 1990s hot war turned nuclear, between the USSR and USA instead of in 2001 like in the canon NGE. Wukong, forced to survive on the streets and fighting off both organized crime groups, terror organizations, the Soviet and American intelligence communities and secret societies interested in his [Wukong's] power and [Wukong] now living under multiple aliases, [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually [Wukong] captured on and [Wukong] experimented on by the paramilitary secret society/survivalist club/social darwinistic organization that promotes the merger of all humanity into one, SEELE [NGE], [Wukong] eventually escaping but [Wukong] becoming disillusioned with human society as he [Wukong] witnesses the rise of the superhuman abilities known as Quirks and the reemergence of non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [Wukong] developing a second personality that [Wukong's second personality] eventually becomes the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possessive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia]. In the alternate 20th century of this story before Second Impact, Japan continued on its [Japan's] growth towards becoming a economic, industrial and cultural superpower [Japan] in Asia from the 1950s to the late 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the \\"Lost Decade\\" of OTL/real life, the PRC in mainland China disintergrated from the chaos of, surrounding and after Second Impact with Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, East Turkestan and Tibet becoming independent from Han China after Second Impact. Descendants of the horned humanoid extraterrestrial creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan] descended from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this scenario] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke, [descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan] which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan] left the hidden from the rest of the world, semi-feudal with superpowers beyond human imagination sub continent of the Elemental Nations [Naruto] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan] losing its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] position of the imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan] and gods [the Ōtsutsuki clan] in all but name of the Elemental Nations sometime after the fight between the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's sub-clan of the Uchiha clan [Naruto franchise] Madara [Naruto franchise] and his [Madara's] rival for power over the Land of Fire in the Elemental Nations, the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's other side branch of the Senju, Hashirama [Naruto franchise], [the Ōtsutsuki clan leaving the Elemental Nations after Hashirama's and Madara's battle for control over the Land of Fire] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently ended up in feudal Japan, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently marrying into both the diclonii and the Japanese aristocracy and nobility, [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan after Second Impact] use the chaos of Second Impact to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] launch a coup against the crumbling Japanese government and [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] subsequently used the Land of the Rising Sun's [Japan's] technological, military and economical resources to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] conquer their [the descendants' of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] homeland [the Elemental Nations], which [the coup launched against the Japanese government by descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] fails somewhat due to the Ōtsutsuki clan being mistaken as the surviving members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato that have regained their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] divine powers gained from the Shinto Gods, with the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan not bothering to correct the mistake, although the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan do succeed in taking control of both the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa. Japan's government also devolves into a somewhat modernized combination of the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored to their pre-1868 position as Japanese Shoguns. The buke [military families |buke|], better known as samurai of the feudal shogunate-dominated era of Japanese history, [the buke] make a return along with the pre-1947 Japanese aristocracy, even though the pre-1947 Japanese military is also restored as well. Japan then subsequently reclaims the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan, Sahlakin Island and the Kurils in the years after Second Impact, restoring the territorial integrity of Imperial Japan in an event comparable to the formation of the German Empire by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1871. The mass emergence of Quirks due to the after-effects of Second Impact, along with the emergence of Diva [another word |Diva| for |what a Diva is also called| a contracted spirit which |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| is |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ is| manifestation of a creature, a concept, or a character from some mythology or folk belief |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| that |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ does| forms |what a Diva forms| a contract with |the human or supernatural entity a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ forms a contract with| a chosen human or supernatural creature, |the human or supernatural creature a ‘Diva’/contracted spirit forms a contract with| usually being a female between the ages of 13-29 |the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature| being represented by |what the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is represented by| a mark known as |what the mark that represents the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is known as| a Stigima that |the Stigma| usually |the Stigma| is |what normally happens to a Stigma| on the contractor’s right hand, |the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature being known as a Stigma| and |what else the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature does apart from the contractor recieving a stigma| giving the contractor |what the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| the ability to |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| materliaize and use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux |Oblique Neckline/Magical Dress/“Cleavage required” (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux), a special set of armor (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) that (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) most of the time resembles (what a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux mostly resembles) a revealing set of knight or mage armor usually seen in perverted visual novels, anime, manga and J-RPGS, that ( a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) can (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only be used by (who are the only persons who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) female humans and supernatural creatures that (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) have (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) formed contracts with (what supernatural entity the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux have formed contracts with) contracted spirits/‘Divas’, that (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only appears (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) when (the time when a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux appears and can be used) the contractor is in battle or (the contractor) otherwise using more than a small percentage of the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s power| as well as |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with apart from receiving a Stigma and gaining the ability to use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux| the ability to use the the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s she has formed a contract with’s magic, |Divas| from |the media franchise Divas are (Divas) from| Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [the emergence of Quirk users, Diva contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology] necessitates the quick restoration and subsequent implementation of the then prototype pre-Second Impact Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system of national qualification which [the Armed Detective system] allows those with the title of, or training to be an Armed Detective to be allowed to bear arms, use supernatural abilities, and have the authority to arrest people, as long as they [the persons training to be or currently being Armed Detectives] have an Armed Detective license, all across the imperial Japanese shogunate. Post Second Impact, post-CCP, Post-PRC Han China itself restores the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-governed Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled [the restored Empire of China ruling over Han China] by the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as its [the restored Empire of China's] imperial family after a covertly Japanese-backed \\"revolution\\" topples the rump PRC. This restored Great Ming State still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's Twelve Symbols national emblem and [the Beiyang Government's] national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", [the restored Great Ming State] flies a modified the Beiyang Government's \\"Five colored flag\\" which [the five colored flag] is [the five coloured flag] is [the five colored flag] a banner Five horizontal bands of red, yellow, blue, white and black with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol in the middle as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. Yuan Shikai, Sun-Yat-Sen's intended heir Wang Jingwei and Mao Zedong are [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] considered to be the people [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] who [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] laid the foundation for the restoration of the Ming in China. The formerly KMT-ruled Nationalist China, formerly [Nationalist China] in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1947, [Nationalist China] manages to take Southern China [Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan] but [Nationalist China] quickly becomes an independent Cantonian republic in all but name. Nationalist China eventually becomes known as the Republic of Cantonia or just Cantonia. Yunnan becomes independent from both Han China and the Nationalist China on Cantonia and [Yunnan] restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government. The pre-WW2 and WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo is restored in post-CCP, PRC, post-Soviet Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and the WW2-era Japanese protectorate Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation is [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] restored [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] in post-CCP, post-PRC Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions and [Mengjiang and Manchukuo] subsequently return to [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] being Japanese protectorates. The restored Great Ming State is [the restored Great Ming State] a Japanese protectorate [the restored Great Ming State] akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China as the WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China. The lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] restored [the Kingdom of Tibet] in Tibet. Japan also restores the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos in Laos and the House of Kobang-ruled Third Burmese Empire in Myanmar. Japan also restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. Both the restored Great Ming State and the restored Manchukuo practice the Beiyang Government's foremost concept of \\"Five Races under One Union\\". The imperial Japanese shogunate is able to spread the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] to all of the nations in Indochina and the China region. Meanwhile in Europe, Germany uses the chaos of the Second Impact to [Germany] regain the Prussian and Czetch territories it [Germany] had lost after WW2. The German House of Hohenzollern-lead Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire returns to power in Germany which [Germany] essentially dominates Europe through the EU after Second Impact. Austria absorbs Czechoslovakia and Hungary into itself to [Austria] reform the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire once more and [Austria] reclaims Transylvania, Banat, Carpathian Ruthenia and South Tyrol, [Austria] then defeating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and [Austria] annexing Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. Austria also joins the EU, which [the EU] has [the EU] become a modern-day incarnation of the Germanic WW1-era Mittleeuropa project and NATO, which [NATO] has effectively become a modern day restoration of the Central Powers. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restoredGerman Empire] restored the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. European Russia is under the rule of a restored Imperial House of Romanov-ruled Russian Empire which [the restored Russian Empire] is [the restored Russian Empire] an EU member, the rest of post-Second Impact, post-Soviet Russia is under the rule of warlords fighting for power. What is left of civilization in America is divided between a theocratic Charismatic evangelical and Trotskyist neoconservative coalition dominated Republican Party-controlled USA in what remains of the USA in the Northern American states and a neo-Confederacy ruled by the white supremacist, warmongering Anglophile Blue Dog Democrats and the KKK in the South, with the West Coast States being controlled by Japan, New England being owned by Canada and the original thirteen states of the USA being a EU protectorate. Europe and East Asia both restructure the UN into an entity resembling a modernized, worldwide version of the Congress of Vienna, with the Europeans also implementing the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] as well. The regions of the USA and the former USSR that were affected by the nuclear holocaust and Second Impact but were too remote to be reached or had collapsed from the aftermath of the post-WW2 civilization's end became known as \\"the Deathlands\\". The form of civilization that has begun to reappear in these places [\\"the deathlands\\"] is brutal, short lived, morally confused, and crazed from mutation, mostly being small plague pits ruled by warlords who [the warlords ruling the plague pits] have no limits to establish their [the warlords'] rule and [the warlords'] expand their influence, [the warlords] being [the warlords] known as the Barons [Deathlands]. Their [the Barons'] rabble pits are [the Barons' rabble pits] known as [what the Barons' rabble pits are called] villes and baronies. The Hidden Villages [Naruto franchise] of chakra [Naruto franchise] using fake shinobi are [the Hidden Villages in this story] merely [the Hidden Villages in this story] a more developed form of villes and baronies with the Kage of each Hidden Village acting as a combination of Town Mayor and Baron. The Hidden Cloud Village is hidden within Germany, the Hidden Rain Village is located within the ruins of NYC, the Hidden Leaf Village is located in Sacramento and the Greater Era, the Land of Tea is the general name given to Southeast Asia by fake shinobi, the Hidden Mist Village is located within Han China, the Hidden Sand Village is located in Riyadah and the Land of Samurai is the name given to Japan by fake shinobi. Neither the wider world nor the rest of the villes or baronies have any idea the Hidden Villages actually exist. During the Cold War both the USSR and the USA developed hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that [the redoubts] contain teleportation technology known as MAT-TRANS [Matter Transfer]. Returning to Wukong for a bit, he [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually able to [Wukong] regain himself [Wukong] and [Wukong] eventually absorb his [Wukong's] \\"Hiashi\\" persona back into himself [Wukong], [Wukong] gaining access to Hiashi's memories, powers, abilities and skills and even his [Hiashi's] Quirk, even though this [Hiashi becoming whole again] causes him [Wukong] to [Wukong] temporarily go insane, [Wukong] accidentally taking the identity of a then young corporate tycoon in the making with a secretly perverted and lecherous personality, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Hyōdō Gorou when the real Gorou is [the real Gorou] killed while [the real Gorou] searching for perverted manga and anime at a J-AV store. As Gorou, Wukong uses his [Gorou's] identity to [Gorou] build a legitimate identity while [Wukong] using Hiashi's skills, knowledge and abilities to keep his [Wukong's] finances in the clear. As Gorou, Wukong eventually marries Gorou's fiancee who [Gorou's fiancee] is [Gorou's fiancee] the current head [Gorou's fiancee] of the Tōno clan's most public side-branch, the partially Han Chinese family of martial artists known as the Arima along with being the daughter [Gorou's fiancee] of the supposedly deceased in the eyes of the galaxy, but actually still alive and well on Earth but now elderly current Crown Prince of the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku, the tall, slender and muscular, wise and calm Masaki Yōshō Jurai [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], who [Yōshō] is [Yōshō] in hiding on Earth as the famed martial artist, swordsman and Shinto priest Masaki Katsuhito [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], in this fic, the brown-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, headstrong and steadfast, highly intelligent but secretly shy and soft spoken corporate executive Miki, who [Miki in this story] becomes [Miki in this story] a loving and kind, caring housewife upon the birth of their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] first child, a brown-haired, amber-eyed boy who [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] inherits Wukong's battle-loving, hyperactive and somewhat careless Saiyan personality along with Vegeta's arrogant nature and a weak pyrokinesis quirk along with a sub-Quirk of \\"Gulity Crown\\", which [Guilty Crown] analyzes intron sequences in the human genome and draws out the power hidden within a person by converting it into a manifestation of the targeted person's heart, [that manifestation] being [the manifestation] known as a Void along with the Saiyan bloodline from both Vegeta and Wukong and Miki's intelligence, street-smarts and weak yokai [monster |yokai|] and [Miki's] strong Juraiouke/Masaki Ouchou blood, [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] Issei. Of course Miki has no idea who her [Miki's] husband [Gorou] really is and [Miki] doesn't question why their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] son [Issei] is [Issei] born with a monkey tail, which [Issei's Saiyan tail] Wukong mind-controls a team of surgical into removing The excerpt should focus on Wukong training a then six-year-old Issei in the bare basics of the martial arts he [Wukong] learnt while [Wukong] traveling across the world with the now-centuries deceased Bulma and the now centuries-deceased Xuanzhang during his [Wukong's] proper time in the past along with those he [Wukong] learned in the present even before he [Wukong] became Hiashi, along with the techniques he [Wukong] learned while [Wukong] in his [Wukong's] time as Hiashi, along with [Wukong] trying to [Wukong] help accelerate his [Wukong's] son's {Issei's] development into a man by [Wukong] giving him [Issei] perverted advice, with Miki simply [Miki] looking on amusement as she [Miki] rubs her [Miki's] swollen stomach, [Miki] being [Miki] pregnant [Miki] with their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] third child","output":"In the tranquil vastness of their sprawling estate, hidden away from the prying eyes of a world rebuilding from apocalypse, Wukong, once Kakkarot and also known as Gorou in this era, stood at the edge of a verdant clearing. His posture was relaxed yet emanated an aura of untamed power. Six-year-old Issei, his brown hair a mess and eyes filled with the fiery ardor of youth, bounced on the balls of his feet, eager to begin. Miki, her amber eyes soft with affection, watched from the porch, her hand resting gently on her significantly swollen belly, a serene smile gracing her face. \\"Alright, Issei,\\" Wukong began, his voice bearing the gravitas of centuries lived and battles won, \\"first, we'll start with the basic stances. A strong foundation is key.\\" He demonstrated, legs shoulder-width apart, one arm forward, the other cocked back. Issei mimicked his father, albeit with less grace, his small body trembling slightly with effort. Wukong circled around Issei, correcting his stance gently but firmly. \\"Good, now hold. It's not just about strength. Focus,\\" he instructed, tapping lightly on Issei's forehead. Issei's eyes closed in concentration, his body steadying. After a moment, Wukong stepped back, nodding with approval. \\"Now, for something a bit more fun,\\" he declared, a mischievous gleam lighting up his eyes. \\"We Saiyans grow stronger with every battle. But remember, my son, the greatest battles are fought not just with fists...\\" He leaned in, whispering conspiratorially, \\"...but with the heart and, sometimes, with the right words.\\" Issei looked up at him, confusion written across his youthful features. Wukong chuckled, ruffling his son's hair. \\"What I mean is, it’s okay to be strong and to fight, but it's also okay to love, to care, and yes,\\" he grinned, \\"to sneak a peek at pretty girls, but only in a respectable manner. Understand?\\" Issei's face lit up with a mix of comprehension and mischief. \\"I think I get it, Dad!\\" From the porch, Miki laughed softly, the sound like bells tinkling in the soft afternoon breeze. She shook her head, amused by her husband's unorthodox teaching methods. \\"Just make sure he grows up kind and respectful, Wukong,\\" she called out, a warm note of teasing in her voice. Wukong turned towards her, his expression softening. \\"Always, my dear. Our children will be the best of both worlds,\\" he promised, his gaze encompassing not just Issei, who was now attempting a high kick, but also Miki, their first son — a unique blend of Saiyan vigor and Jurai tranquility — and the unborn child she carried, another testament to their extraordinary lineage. As Wukong turned back to Issei, guiding him through a series of jumps and punches, laughter and occasional words of encouragement filled the air. Miki watched, her heart swelling with love and pride for her family — a beacon of hope and unity in a world once torn asunder, now healing and growing stronger, just like the legacy they were building together. In this secluded corner of the world, amidst lessons of martial prowess and playful banter, the foundations of a new era were being laid — one where strength was balanced with wisdom, power with kindness, and where every new day brought a promise of hope, nurtured by the bonds of an extraordinary family destined to leave their mark on the galaxy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

What kind of rule would she likely prefer and why? Group of answer choices closed rule, because she does not want amendments offered that could potentially kill or water down the bill closed rule, because this would eliminate the possibility of the president vetoing the bill open rule, because most legislators want others to offer amendments to their legislation to make it better open rule because this would mean it could bypass the Senate and immediately go to the president for signature\\"","output":"A representative who has proposed a bill on criminal justice reform and wants to prevent the possibility of amendments that could potentially derail or weaken the bill would likely prefer a \\"closed rule.\\" This preference arises because a closed rule restricts or completely prohibits the introduction of amendments during the floor debate. This control over amendments can help ensure that the bill remains intact as per the representative's vision and objectives, reducing the risk of modifications that could compromise its original intent or effectiveness. So, the correct choice is: \\"closed rule, because she does not want amendments offered that could potentially kill or water down the bill.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer \\"One advantage of seniority in Congress is it makes a congressperson Group of answer choices less likely to participate in committee work. more likely to get leadership in a committee. less likely to have to participate in subcommittees. less likely to have to serve as president pro tempore.\\"","output":"One advantage of seniority in Congress is it makes a congressperson \\"more likely to get leadership in a committee.\\" Seniority is often a major factor in determining committee leadership roles within Congress. Members with longer tenure are typically given priority when leadership positions, such as committee chairmanships, are assigned. This system rewards experience and longevity in office, under the presumption that senior members have accumulated the knowledge, expertise, and relationships necessary to effectively lead and navigate legislative processes."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"Why might ping-ponging procedures be preferred over calling a conference committee to reconcile Senate and House differences? Group of answer choices An opponent has more opportunities to block a bill during a conference committee by adding unfavorable amendments or by using the filibuster but party leaders can shield much of this through ping-ponging. Ping-ponging is more deliberative and gives many more individuals a say in the bill’s contents so legislation can improve through this process compared to conference committees. Party leaders have more control over conference committees because they appoint them, but ping-ponging allows minority party members more input into the final bill. The president controls the conference committee, while members of Congress can have more control over ping-ponging.\\"","output":"The correct choice is: \\"An opponent has more opportunities to block a bill during a conference committee by adding unfavorable amendments or by using the filibuster but party leaders can shield much of this through ping-ponging.\\" In the process of ping-ponging, a bill is sent back and forth between the House and the Senate until both chambers agree on the text. This method can be preferred because it allows the leadership to more directly manage the negotiation process and potentially bypass or limit the opportunities for opponents to derail the legislation with amendments or filibusters that are more likely to occur during a conference committee. Conference committees involve a selected group of members from both chambers working out the differences, and the process can be more formal and susceptible to delays or obstructions. In contrast, ping-ponging keeps the bill within the more controlled environments of each chamber's floor proceedings, under the closer oversight of party leadership."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"Oversight can best be described as the Group of answer choices efforts of Congress to supervise the manner in which its laws are implemented by the executive branch. organizational control exercised by party whips over members of Congress. authority of committee chairs over the hearings and investigations conducted by the subcommittees. approval that the Senate must give to all presidential appointments to the federal judiciary.\\"","output":"Oversight can best be described as the \\"efforts of Congress to supervise the manner in which its laws are implemented by the executive branch.\\" Oversight refers to the review, monitoring, and supervision of federal agencies, programs, activities, and policy implementation by the executive branch. Congress exercises this power to ensure laws are administered in accordance with legislative intent, to prevent waste and fraud, to protect civil liberties and rights, and to secure the effective operation of government."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"The apportionment of voters in districts in such a way as to give unfair advantage to one racial or ethnic group or political party is known as Group of answer choices the census. elections. gerrymandering. redistricting.\\"","output":"The apportionment of voters in districts in such a way as to give unfair advantage to one racial or ethnic group or political party is known as \\"gerrymandering.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer \\"A major risk of the delegate model of representation is that Group of answer choices no new laws will be passed because all representatives must agree before a bill can be enacted. elected officials will spend too much time attempting to raise money for their next campaign because they must seek re-election so frequently. elected officials will completely ignore their constituents’ preferences because they are following their own beliefs about which policies are best. the voices of only a few active and informed constituents will be heard because most people do not pay close attention to every issue.\\"","output":"A major risk of the delegate model of representation is that \\"the voices of only a few active and informed constituents will be heard because most people do not pay close attention to every issue.\\" In the delegate model of representation, elected officials seek to act directly in accordance with the wishes and preferences of their constituents, essentially serving as their delegates. A significant risk of this model is that it might disproportionately amplify the views of a vocal minority who are more politically engaged, while the broader preferences of the less active or informed majority of constituents might not be adequately represented. This can lead to policy decisions that do not accurately reflect the wants or needs of the entire community or constituency."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"A major risk of the delegate model of representation is that Group of answer choices no new laws will be passed because all representatives must agree before a bill can be enacted. elected officials will spend too much time attempting to raise money for their next campaign because they must seek re-election so frequently. elected officials will completely ignore their constituents’ preferences because they are following their own beliefs about which policies are best. the voices of only a few active and informed constituents will be heard because most people do not pay close attention to every issue.\\"","output":"A major risk of the delegate model of representation is that \\"the voices of only a few active and informed constituents will be heard because most people do not pay close attention to every issue.\\" This risk implies that in attempting to directly represent the wishes of their constituents, elected officials might end up disproportionately catering to those who are most vocal or engaged, potentially neglecting the broader interests of the entire electorate, many of whom may not be as active or informed about every specific issue."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"When Democratic members of Congress were considering the Affordable Care Act, many were divided on the bill. Some favored it and others opposed it. What would be the role of the whip in this situation? Group of answer choices to make committee assignments to call the gathering of a conference to line up party members on a vote for this bill to elect the minority party leader\\"","output":"In the situation where Democratic members of Congress were divided on the Affordable Care Act, the role of the whip would be \\"to line up party members on a vote for this bill.\\" The primary function of the whip in any legislative body is to secure party discipline, especially on key votes. In this context, the Democratic whip would work to ensure that members of their party are aligned in their voting, aiming to marshal the necessary support for the Affordable Care Act to pass. This involves counting votes, persuading undecided or wavering legislators, and coordinating the party's legislative strategy to achieve a favorable outcome."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"Which of the following statements about the role of constituents in congressional decision making is true? Group of answer choices Constituents play an important role in members of Congress’s decisions since members would like to be reelected. Since constituents pay little attention to politics, members of Congress do not consider their opinions when making decisions. Most members of Congress win reelection so they do not have to consider constituents’ opinion as much as other factors like what their party or special interest groups want. Over time, as party polarization has increased, there has been less need for members to consider constituents’ opinions because voters just rely on partisan cues when voting.\\"","output":"The statement about the role of constituents in congressional decision making that is true is: \\"Constituents play an important role in members of Congress’s decisions since members would like to be reelected.\\" Members of Congress are keenly aware of the preferences and opinions of their constituents because their primary goal often includes being reelected. They engage in various activities such as holding town hall meetings, sending newsletters, and maintaining active social media channels to gauge public opinion in their districts or states. The desire for reelection motivates them to align their legislative actions with the interests and preferences of their constituents to some extent, as alienating voters could jeopardize their chances in the next election."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"Which of the following statements about partisan polarization in Congress is true? Group of answer choices Republicans and Democrats in Congress are ideologically very similar, which has led some progressives and conservatives to propose working together to establish a third party. Republicans and Democrats in Congress used to be very polarized in the 1960s and 1970s, but the parties have increasingly worked together to pass large-scale legislative proposals. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been diverging since the mid-1970s and are more polarized now than at any time in the last century. In the 1990s, Democrats and Republicans in Congress began diverging ideologically, yet the trend has reversed with the election of Joe Biden as president.\\"","output":"The statement about partisan polarization in Congress that is true is: \\"Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been diverging since the mid-1970s and are more polarized now than at any time in the last century.\\" Partisan polarization refers to the degree of ideological division and opposition between political parties. Over the past several decades, the gap between Republicans and Democrats in Congress concerning ideological and policy positions has markedly increased. This divergence has led to heightened partisanship, with both parties showing less willingness to compromise, which has significant implications for the legislative process and governance."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"The growth of the Latino population in the United States is significant because Group of answer choices states with large Latino populations would lose seats in Congress. this would not change the apportionment that happens every 10 years. Latino voters would be less likely to be represented in Congress. states with sizeable Latino populations could gain seats in Congress.\\"","output":"The growth of the Latino population in the United States is significant because \\"states with sizeable Latino populations could gain seats in Congress.\\" The apportionment of seats in the United States House of Representatives is based on population, as determined by the decennial census. As the Latino population in the United States grows, states with large Latino populations have the potential to gain additional seats in Congress due to this increase in population. This demographic shift can influence political representation and potentially shift political power within Congress."},{"instruction":"Answer \\"How do the different constituencies represented by U.S. representatives and senators shape how these members perform their duties? Group of answer choices Representatives generally only focus on pork barrel efforts due to their narrow constituency, while senators never engage in pork barrel politics because it may alienate constituents who do not receive the benefits. Since representatives serve small constituencies, they do not rely on special interest groups; senators are much more reliant on campaign donations and therefore less in tune with voters of their state. Representatives serve a small constituency and therefore must focus on constituent service and casework, while senators serve a broad, statewide constituency and therefore do not engage in casework or constituent service. Due to a small, more uniform constituency and frequent elections, representatives are often more attuned to narrower, local interests, while senators, with their statewide, diverse consistency, are a bit more insulated and must balance competing influences.\\"","output":"\\"Due to a small, more uniform constituency and frequent elections, representatives are often more attuned to narrower, local interests, while senators, with their statewide, diverse consistency, are a bit more insulated and must balance competing influences.\\" U.S. Representatives serve smaller districts within states and are elected every two years, making them more sensitive to the local and immediate concerns of their constituents. This often necessitates a focus on casework, constituent services, and local issues. Senators, on the other hand, represent entire states and are elected every six years. This broader constituency includes a more diverse set of interests, requiring senators to balance and address the needs and concerns of various groups within their state. While senators also engage in constituent services and casework, the scope and nature of the issues they address can be broader compared to that of representatives."},{"instruction":"answer \\"A major risk of the delegate model of representation is that no new laws will be passed because all representatives must agree before a bill can be enacted. elected officials will spend too much time attempting to raise money for their next campaign because they must seek re-election so frequently. elected officials will completely ignore their constituents’ preferences because they are following their own beliefs about which policies are best. the voices of only a few active and informed constituents will be heard because most people do not pay close attention to every issue.\\"","output":"A major risk of the delegate model of representation is that \\"the voices of only a few active and informed constituents will be heard because most people do not pay close attention to every issue.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer \\"What is the role of the Office of Management and Budget?

Here are some of the primary reasons: 1. **Computational Resources**: Generative AI models, especially those at the cutting edge like GPT-3, require an extensive amount of computational power both for training and inference (generating output from the model). The training process involves crunching massive datasets and constantly adjusting the model's parameters, which can only be done efficiently with high-end GPUs or specialized hardware like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). This hardware is expensive not just in terms of acquisition but also in terms of electricity consumption and cooling requirements. 2. **Large Datasets**: To train generative AI models, substantial datasets are necessary. These datasets must be diverse, high-quality, and often labeled for supervised learning tasks. Acquiring, cleaning, and processing these datasets can be very costly. 3. **Expertise and Labor**: The field of AI, especially generative AI, is highly specialized. Researchers, data scientists, and engineers with the expertise to develop and fine-tune these models command high salaries. Furthermore, teams are often multidisciplinary, including not just AI experts but also software engineers, data engineers, project managers, and more, all contributing to higher labor costs. 4. **Infrastructure and Maintenance**: Beyond the initial model training, deploying generative AI applications at scale requires robust infrastructure. This includes not only the servers and hardware to continuously run these models but also the software architecture to integrate them into applications seamlessly. Maintaining this infrastructure, ensuring high availability, and updating models with new data or to improve performance add ongoing costs. 5. **Research and Development**: The field of generative AI is rapidly evolving. Staying competitive often means investing in ongoing R&D to refine existing models or develop new approaches. This continuous investment in innovation is costly but necessary to maintain an edge. 6. **Ethical and Regulatory Compliance**: As the use of AI expands, so do concerns around ethics, privacy, and bias. Ensuring that generative AI models comply with regulatory requirements, ethical standards, and social expectations can require additional oversight, auditing, and potentially retraining of models, all of which incur costs. 7. **Environmentally Sustainable Practices**: With growing awareness of the environmental impact of large-scale computing, there's increasing pressure to offset carbon emissions and utilize green energy sources. This emphasis on sustainability can further increase operational costs for companies committed to environmentally friendly practices. These factors combined contribute to the high expense associated with developing, deploying, and maintaining generative AI systems. Despite these costs, the transformative potential of generative AI across industries—from content creation and design to drug discovery and beyond—continues to drive significant investment in this technology."},{"instruction":"Write an intresting, action-packed excerpt for a crossover fanfic between the Gun-ota ga Mahou Sekai ni Tensei Shitara, Gendai Heiki de Guntai Harem o Tsukucchaimashita!?

The Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium has its [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] canon civilian and military technologies with the Star Wars humans having the same psychic and magical powers and hyper-intelligence as the Primoris prognatus in canon Halo in addition to the Primoris prognatus' canon civilian and military technologies and the same being true for the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku and the Covenant. The Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku also replaces the galaxy-spanning paramilitary force/meritocratic military organization/pirate guild lead by the infamous race of horned extraterrestrial warmongers known as the Frost Demons [Dragon Ball Z], the Planetary Trade Organization [Dragon Ball Z], [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku in this fic] also having the PTO's technology, weapons and equipment, with the Juraians [Tenchi Muyo], a humanoid extraterrestrial race [the Jurians] of psychics and magic users good at electronics and mechanics [the Jurians] replacing the Frost Demons [Dragon Ball Z] and [the Jurians] also having the Frost Demons' swordsmanships and qi/ki manipulation abilities in addition to their [the Juraians'] own canonical abilities and skills, [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku replacing the PTO and the Jurians replacing the Frost Demons in this fic] thus making them [the Juraians in this story] the masters [the Juraians in this story] of the naturally aggressive warrior race descended from Great Apes who gained intelligence and took on a humanoid form who, since ancient times, have lived a violent and inhumane lifestyle, where they attack numerous planets to build up wealth and goods, the Saiyans [Dragon Ball Z], [the Juraians being the masters of the Saiyans in this fic] and [the Juraians in this fic] using the Saiyans to conquer and clean out multiple planets not just across the Milky Way, but across the various galaxies for them [the Juraians in this fic]. The descendant of low-class warrior Saiyans imprinted with only enough training to fight and conquer, Kakkarot [Dragon Ball franchise] is [Kakkarot] still [Kakkarot] sent to Earth to [Kakkarot] conquer it [Earth] sometime in the 500 AD period of human history as a baby, [Kakkarot] being [Kakkarot] adopted by Grandpa Gohan [Dragon Ball] after his [Kakkarot's] spaceship crashlanded on a hyperadvanced, semi-spacefaring version of ancient Earth, more specifically in the Han Chinese Imperial House of Yang-ruled Great Sui State/Sui dynasty ruling over Han China and [Kakkarot] being given the Chinese name of 'Sun Wukong' by Grandpa Gohan. After Gohan's death when Wukong was just a child, Wukong starts traveling the world with the heiress of the European-based megacorp, Capsule Corp [Dragon Ball franchise], the blue-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent Bulma Briefs and the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang during the reign of the Mongol-Manchurian Imperial House of Li-ruled Great Tang Empire/\\"Tang dynasty\\" over Han China from East Turkestan and the Hui-dominated Central China, [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] becoming [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] known as the famous \\"Journey to the West\\". After defeating the green-skinned, maniacal \\"demon lord\\" Piccolo and thus saving the world with the help of Xuanzang and Bulma, Wukong then [Wukong] decides [Wukong] to [Wukong] enter the World Martial Arts tournament to [Wukong] test his [Wukong's] strength and power as well as [Wukong] learn new skills and [Wukong] meet new people, [Wukong] eventually becoming the winner [Wukong] of the tournament. Before he [Wukong] can [Wukong] claim his [Wukong's] victory, his [Wukong's] old rival in the form of the technocratic cult with dreams of World Domination, the Red Ribbon Army [Dragon Ball franchise] shows up, and in the chaos Wukong finds himself [Wukong] blasted into what he [Wukong] later discovers is [Wukong] the far-future of the 20th century via taking a energy displacement weapon meant for Bulma. The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, Trunks' descendants more specifically intermarry with the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] and a sub-branch of the real-life Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [Trunks' descendants intermarrying with both the diclonii and the sub-branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] becoming known as the combined samurai clan/Japanese noble house of Tōno [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon]. Back in the 20th century, the apocalyptic event caused by Antarctica being struck by a large asteroid known as Second Impact happened at the end of a late 1980s-early 1990s hot war turned nuclear, between the USSR and USA instead of in 2001 like in the canon NGE. Wukong, forced to survive on the streets and fighting off both organized crime groups, terror organizations, the Soviet and American intelligence communities and secret societies interested in his [Wukong's] power and [Wukong] now living under multiple aliases, [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually [Wukong] captured on and [Wukong] experimented on by the paramilitary secret society/survivalist club/social darwinistic organization that promotes the merger of all humanity into one, SEELE [NGE], [Wukong] eventually escaping but [Wukong] becoming disillusioned with human society as he [Wukong] witnesses the rise of the superhuman abilities known as Quirks and the reemergence of non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [Wukong] developing a second personality that [Wukong's second personality] eventually becomes the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possessive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia]. In the alternate 20th century of this story before Second Impact, Japan continued on its [Japan's] growth towards becoming a economic, industrial and cultural superpower [Japan] in Asia from the 1950s to the late 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the \\"Lost Decade\\" of OTL/real life, the PRC in mainland China disintergrated from the chaos of, surrounding and after Second Impact with Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, East Turkestan and Tibet becoming independent from Han China after Second Impact. Descendants of the horned humanoid extraterrestrial creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan] descended from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this scenario] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke, [descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan] which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan] left the hidden from the rest of the world, semi-feudal with superpowers beyond human imagination sub continent of the Elemental Nations [Naruto] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan] losing its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] position of the imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan] and gods [the Ōtsutsuki clan] in all but name of the Elemental Nations sometime after the fight between the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's sub-clan of the Uchiha clan [Naruto franchise] Madara [Naruto franchise] and his [Madara's] rival for power over the Land of Fire in the Elemental Nations, the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's other side branch of the Senju, Hashirama [Naruto franchise], [the Ōtsutsuki clan leaving the Elemental Nations after Hashirama's and Madara's battle for control over the Land of Fire] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently ended up in feudal Japan, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently marrying into both the diclonii and the Japanese aristocracy and nobility, [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan after Second Impact] use the chaos of Second Impact to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] launch a coup against the crumbling Japanese government and [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] subsequently used the Land of the Rising Sun's [Japan's] technological, military and economical resources to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] conquer their [the descendants' of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] homeland [the Elemental Nations], which [the coup launched against the Japanese government by descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] fails somewhat due to the Ōtsutsuki clan being mistaken as the surviving members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato that have regained their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] divine powers gained from the Shinto Gods, with the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan not bothering to correct the mistake, although the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan do succeed in taking control of both the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa. Japan's government also devolves into a somewhat modernized combination of the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored to their pre-1868 position as Japanese Shoguns. The buke [military families |buke|], better known as samurai of the feudal shogunate-dominated era of Japanese history, [the buke] make a return along with the pre-1947 Japanese aristocracy, even though the pre-1947 Japanese military is also restored as well. Japan then subsequently reclaims the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan, Sahlakin Island and the Kurils in the years after Second Impact, restoring the territorial integrity of Imperial Japan in an event comparable to the formation of the German Empire by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1871. The mass emergence of Quirks due to the after-effects of Second Impact, along with the emergence of Diva [another word |Diva| for |what a Diva is also called| a contracted spirit which |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| is |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ is| manifestation of a creature, a concept, or a character from some mythology or folk belief |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| that |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ does| forms |what a Diva forms| a contract with |the human or supernatural entity a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ forms a contract with| a chosen human or supernatural creature, |the human or supernatural creature a ‘Diva’/contracted spirit forms a contract with| usually being a female between the ages of 13-29 |the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature| being represented by |what the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is represented by| a mark known as |what the mark that represents the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is known as| a Stigima that |the Stigma| usually |the Stigma| is |what normally happens to a Stigma| on the contractor’s right hand, |the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature being known as a Stigma| and |what else the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature does apart from the contractor recieving a stigma| giving the contractor |what the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| the ability to |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| materliaize and use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux |Oblique Neckline/Magical Dress/“Cleavage required” (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux), a special set of armor (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) that (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) most of the time resembles (what a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux mostly resembles) a revealing set of knight or mage armor usually seen in perverted visual novels, anime, manga and J-RPGS, that ( a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) can (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only be used by (who are the only persons who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) female humans and supernatural creatures that (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) have (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) formed contracts with (what supernatural entity the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux have formed contracts with) contracted spirits/‘Divas’, that (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only appears (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) when (the time when a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux appears and can be used) the contractor is in battle or (the contractor) otherwise using more than a small percentage of the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s power| as well as |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with apart from receiving a Stigma and gaining the ability to use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux| the ability to use the the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s she has formed a contract with’s magic, |Divas| from |the media franchise Divas are (Divas) from| Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [the emergence of Quirk users, Diva contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology] necessitates the quick restoration and subsequent implementation of the then prototype pre-Second Impact Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system of national qualification which [the Armed Detective system] allows those with the title of, or training to be an Armed Detective to be allowed to bear arms, use supernatural abilities, and have the authority to arrest people, as long as they [the persons training to be or currently being Armed Detectives] have an Armed Detective license, all across the imperial Japanese shogunate. Post Second Impact, post-CCP, Post-PRC Han China itself restores the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-governed Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled [the restored Empire of China ruling over Han China] by the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as its [the restored Empire of China's] imperial family after a covertly Japanese-backed \\"revolution\\" topples the rump PRC. This restored Great Ming State still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's Twelve Symbols national emblem and [the Beiyang Government's] national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", [the restored Great Ming State] flies a modified the Beiyang Government's \\"Five colored flag\\" which [the five colored flag] is [the five coloured flag] is [the five colored flag] a banner Five horizontal bands of red, yellow, blue, white and black with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol in the middle as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. Yuan Shikai, Sun-Yat-Sen's intended heir Wang Jingwei and Mao Zedong are [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] considered to be the people [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] who [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] laid the foundation for the restoration of the Ming in China. The formerly KMT-ruled Nationalist China, formerly [Nationalist China] in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1947, [Nationalist China] manages to take Southern China [Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan] but [Nationalist China] quickly becomes an independent Cantonian republic in all but name. Nationalist China eventually becomes known as the Republic of Cantonia or just Cantonia. Yunnan becomes independent from both Han China and the Nationalist China on Cantonia and [Yunnan] restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government. The pre-WW2 and WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo is restored in post-CCP, PRC, post-Soviet Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and the WW2-era Japanese protectorate Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation is [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] restored [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] in post-CCP, post-PRC Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions and [Mengjiang and Manchukuo] subsequently return to [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] being Japanese protectorates. The restored Great Ming State is [the restored Great Ming State] a Japanese protectorate [the restored Great Ming State] akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China as the WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China. The lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] restored [the Kingdom of Tibet] in Tibet. Japan also restores the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos in Laos and the House of Kobang-ruled Third Burmese Empire in Myanmar. Japan also restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. Both the restored Great Ming State and the restored Manchukuo practice the Beiyang Government's foremost concept of \\"Five Races under One Union\\". The imperial Japanese shogunate is able to spread the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] to all of the nations in Indochina and the China region. Meanwhile in Europe, Germany uses the chaos of the Second Impact to [Germany] regain the Prussian and Czetch territories it [Germany] had lost after WW2. The German House of Hohenzollern-lead Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire returns to power in Germany which [Germany] essentially dominates Europe through the EU after Second Impact. Austria absorbs Czechoslovakia and Hungary into itself to [Austria] reform the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire once more and [Austria] reclaims Transylvania, Banat, Carpathian Ruthenia and South Tyrol, [Austria] then defeating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and [Austria] annexing Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. Austria also joins the EU, which [the EU] has [the EU] become a modern-day incarnation of the Germanic WW1-era Mittleeuropa project and NATO, which [NATO] has effectively become a modern day restoration of the Central Powers. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restoredGerman Empire] restored the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. European Russia is under the rule of a restored Imperial House of Romanov-ruled Russian Empire which [the restored Russian Empire] is [the restored Russian Empire] an EU member, the rest of post-Second Impact, post-Soviet Russia is under the rule of warlords fighting for power. What is left of civilization in America is divided between a theocratic Charismatic evangelical and Trotskyist neoconservative coalition dominated Republican Party-controlled USA in what remains of the USA in the Northern American states and a neo-Confederacy ruled by the white supremacist, warmongering Anglophile Blue Dog Democrats and the KKK in the South, with the West Coast States being controlled by Japan, New England being owned by Canada and the original thirteen states of the USA being a EU protectorate. Europe and East Asia both restructure the UN into an entity resembling a modernized, worldwide version of the Congress of Vienna, with the Europeans also implementing the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] as well. The regions of the USA and the former USSR that were affected by the nuclear holocaust and Second Impact but were too remote to be reached or had collapsed from the aftermath of the post-WW2 civilization's end became known as \\"the Deathlands\\". The form of civilization that has begun to reappear in these places [\\"the deathlands\\"] is brutal, short lived, morally confused, and crazed from mutation, mostly being small plague pits ruled by warlords who [the warlords ruling the plague pits] have no limits to establish their [the warlords'] rule and [the warlords'] expand their influence, [the warlords] being [the warlords] known as the Barons [Deathlands]. Their [the Barons'] rabble pits are [the Barons' rabble pits] known as [what the Barons' rabble pits are called] villes and baronies. The Hidden Villages [Naruto franchise] of chakra [Naruto franchise] using fake shinobi are [the Hidden Villages in this story] merely [the Hidden Villages in this story] a more developed form of villes and baronies with the Kage of each Hidden Village acting as a combination of Town Mayor and Baron. The Hidden Cloud Village is hidden within Germany, the Hidden Rain Village is located within the ruins of NYC, the Hidden Leaf Village is located in Sacramento and the Greater Era, the Land of Tea is the general name given to Southeast Asia by fake shinobi, the Hidden Mist Village is located within Han China, the Hidden Sand Village is located in Riyadah and the Land of Samurai is the name given to Japan by fake shinobi. Neither the wider world nor the rest of the villes or baronies have any idea the Hidden Villages actually exist. During the Cold War both the USSR and the USA developed hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that [the redoubts] contain teleportation technology known as MAT-TRANS [Matter Transfer]. Returning to Wukong for a bit, he [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually able to [Wukong] regain himself [Wukong] and [Wukong] eventually absorb his [Wukong's] \\"Hiashi\\" persona back into himself [Wukong], [Wukong] gaining access to Hiashi's memories, powers, abilities and skills and even his [Hiashi's] Quirk, even though this [Hiashi becoming whole again] causes him [Wukong] to [Wukong] temporarily go insane, [Wukong] accidentally taking the identity of a then young corporate tycoon in the making with a secretly perverted and lecherous personality, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Hyōdō Gorou when the real Gorou is [the real Gorou] killed while [the real Gorou] searching for perverted manga and anime at a J-AV store. As Gorou, Wukong uses his [Gorou's] identity to [Gorou] build a legitimate identity while [Wukong] using Hiashi's skills, knowledge and abilities to keep his [Wukong's] finances in the clear. As Gorou, Wukong eventually marries Gorou's fiancee who [Gorou's fiancee] is [Gorou's fiancee] the current head [Gorou's fiancee] of the Tōno clan's most public side-branch, the partially Han Chinese family of martial artists known as the Arima along with being the daughter [Gorou's fiancee] of the supposedly deceased in the eyes of the galaxy, but actually still alive and well on Earth but now elderly current Crown Prince of the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku, the tall, slender and muscular, wise and calm Masaki Yōshō Jurai [Tenchi Muyo!

Amidst the serene, garden-like setting, a scene that belied the tumultuous state of the wider world outside its walls unfolded—a father and son engaged in martial arts training, a ritual as old as time itself. Wukong, formerly known as Kakkarot but now living under the guise of Hyōdō Gorou, stood opposite his six-year-old son, Issei. Clad in simple, traditional training garb, Wukong's stance was relaxed yet disciplined, a testament to centuries of experience and a myriad of battles fought across different eras and dimensions. His eyes, reflecting a compassionate but unyielding spirit, were fixed on Issei, encouraging the boy through each movement. Issei, for his part, exuded a blend of eagerness and concentration that made it clear he was his father's son. Despite his age, there was an unmistakable spark within him—a potential that Wukong was keen to nurture. With a gentle nod from his father, Issei launched into a series of basic martial arts forms, his movements fluid yet slightly unrefined. \\"Remember, Issei,\\" Wukong's voice was steady but filled with warmth. \\"Martial arts aren't just about fighting. They're about understanding yourself, controlling your power, and respecting your opponent.\\" Issei nodded, absorbing his father's words as he transitioned from one form to the next, trying to embody the principles Wukong had imparted. The young boy's focus was unbreakable, even as he occasionally stumbled, his determination only seemed to grow. Watching from the sidelines, with an affectionate smile playing on her lips, was Miki. Seated comfortably on a garden bench, she gently rubbed her swollen stomach, the life within her a symbol of hope and continuity in a world that had seen so much upheaval. Her gaze alternated between Issei's earnest attempts at mastery and Wukong's patient tutelage, a scene that filled her with an indescribable sense of pride and joy. Nearby, Kunō, the couple's two-year-old daughter, watched her brother and father with wide, amber eyes filled with curiosity and delight. Her kitsune ears twitched playfully as she tried to mimic her brother's stances, albeit in a more whimsical and childlike manner, adding a gentle levity to the morning's proceedings. After a particularly intensive session, Wukong called for a brief pause, crouching down to Issei's level. \\"You did well today, my son,\\" he said, ruffling Issei's hair affectionately. \\"But remember, a true warrior also needs to understand the world beyond the fight. The heart, mind, and spirit must all be strong.\\" Seizing the moment for a bit of lightheartedness, Wukong leaned closer, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. \\"And don't forget, the key to understanding others—especially when you're older—might sometimes come from knowing how to navigate the tender landscape of the heart. Be brave, but also be kind. And maybe a little crafty,\\" he added, a mischievous glint in his eyes that hinted at his own adventures and the lessons learned from them. Issei's eyes widened with an intrigued mix of bewilderment and excitement. \\"Crafty? Like in stories?\\" \\"Exactly like in stories,\\" Wukong chuckled, standing and casting a knowing glance at Miki, whose amusement was evident in her gently shaking shoulders. As the sun climbed higher, bathing the courtyard in a warm, golden light, the Hyōdō family's day of training, laughter, and togetherness continued. In this hidden slice of paradise, away from the grand battles and cosmic struggles, the legendary warrior Wukong found a different kind of fulfillment—one rooted in the joys of fatherhood, the love of family, and the quiet moments that stitched the fabric of their lives together."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To correct the operations and ensure that the first 7 rows are treated correctly (acknowledging the incomplete data due to the nature of your operation), and to address the problem with the removal of incorrect rows, let's go through your script with appropriate modifications. 1. **Correct Handling of the First 7 Rows**: You want to ensure that the first 7 rows, which will have incomplete data due to the absence of prior rows for them, are indeed handled as such. Your code already seems to aim at addressing this by filling missing values with empty strings if there are not enough previous rows. However, the confusion might arise from an expectation versus the actual results produced, as this handling affects how data appears, but not necessarily their operational presence (i.e., they exist but with empty strings). 2. **Avoiding Removal of the Last Rows**: Your current script does not explicitly remove the last rows. However, transformation might be leading to unexpected results due to how data is appended or not correctly filled for the preceding day's data. Also, the comment \`# transformed_df = transformed_df.iloc[7:]\` if uncommented would slice off the first 7 rows, not the last. Let's slightly adjust your script to emphasize clarity regarding initial rows handling and ensuring that the output is as expected without affecting the last rows. This adjustment primarily focuses on the step where you're extending your dataframe with new columns from the previous 7 rows. We'll add a more explicit handling of early rows to demonstrate they're being operated differently due to their nature. **Note:** Direct algorithmic adjustments for handling the first few rows and a correction for any misconceptions about the last rows being removed are included. This script assumes you aim to extend each row with data from the previous 7 days while acknowledging that the first 7 rows will have incomplete data due to this operation: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import os csv_folder_path = r\\"E:01_calculate_talibNew Folder\\" for csv_file in os.listdir(csv_folder_path): file_path = os.path.join(csv_folder_path, csv_file) df = pd.read_csv(file_path) original_columns_count = len(df.columns) original_columns = df.columns.tolist() # Adjusted part: Explicit definition for the extended column names new_column_names = [] prefixes = ['', 'n7d_', 'n6d_', 'n5d_', 'n4d_', 'n3d_', 'n2d_', 'n1d_'] for prefix in prefixes: new_column_names.extend([f\\"{prefix}{name}\\" for name in original_columns]) # Initialize the new DataFrame with extended columns transformed_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=new_column_names) # Iterate over rows to fill in the new DataFrame for i, row in df.iterrows(): new_row = row.values.tolist() for j in range(1, 8): prev_row = df.iloc[i-j].values.tolist() if i-j >= 0 else [''] * original_columns_count new_row = prev_row + new_row transformed_df = transformed_df.append(pd.Series(new_row, index=new_column_names), ignore_index=True) # Removing specific columns, such as ones with 'Unix' in their name columns_to_remove = transformed_df.filter(like='Unix').columns transformed_df.drop(columns=columns_to_remove, inplace=True) # Saving the transformed DataFrame back to CSV transformed_df.to_csv(file_path.replace('.csv', '_transformed.csv'), index=False) # Save as a new file for safety print(f\\"Transformation complete for {csv_file}.

Did you mean: '_append'?","output":"The \`AttributeError\` you encountered suggests that there's been a misunderstanding about how the \`append\` method is used with pandas DataFrames. The \`append\` method is indeed a valid method for pandas DataFrames, used for appending rows to a DataFrame. Given this, the error you received is unexpected under normal circumstances. If you are experiencing this error with the \`append\` method, it might be due to an issue unrelated to the \`append\` method's existence or functionality within pandas. This could be a version-specific issue, an environment issue, or some corner-case bug. However, to sidestep this issue and still achieve your goal, I recommend using another approach to add rows to the DataFrame. Instead of appending rows one by one, which can be inefficient, you could collect the rows in a list and then create a new DataFrame from that list in one go. This method is generally faster and should not give you the AttributeError. Here's how to adapt your script by using a list to collect new rows and then creating the DataFrame: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import os csv_folder_path = r\\"E:01_calculate_talibNew Folder\\" for csv_file in os.listdir(csv_folder_path): file_path = os.path.join(csv_folder_path, csv_file) df = pd.read_csv(file_path) original_columns = df.columns.tolist() # Explicit definition for the extended column names new_column_names = [] prefixes = ['', 'n7d_', 'n6d_', 'n5d_', 'n4d_', 'n3d_', 'n2d_', 'n1d_'] for prefix in prefixes: new_column_names.extend([f\\"{prefix}{name}\\" for name in original_columns]) new_rows = [] # List to collect the new rows # Iterate over rows to construct the new_rows list for i in range(len(df)): new_row = df.iloc[i].tolist() for j in range(1, 8): prev_row = df.iloc[i-j].tolist() if i-j >= 0 else [''] * len(original_columns) new_row = prev_row + new_row new_rows.append(new_row) transformed_df = pd.DataFrame(new_rows, columns=new_column_names) # Removing columns matching a pattern columns_to_remove = transformed_df.filter(like='Unix').columns transformed_df.drop(columns=columns_to_remove, inplace=True) # Save the transformed dataframe into a new CSV to avoid overwriting the original transformed_df.to_csv(file_path.replace('.csv', '_transformed.csv'), index=False) print(f\\"Transformation complete for {csv_file}. Check the transformed file.\\") \`\`\` This version of your code constructs \`new_rows\` through iteration and then creates a DataFrame \`transformed_df\` from this list, using \`new_column_names\` for the column names. This approach should not trigger the \`AttributeError\` as it doesn't rely on the DataFrame's \`append\` method.

Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity.","output":"Sure, let's break this down to understand the concepts better. The composition of substances, whether they are mixtures or pure substances, is fundamentally based on their elemental composition, which is the proportion by mass of each element contained within them. # Pure Substances A **pure substance** is any single type of material that has a specific chemical composition. This could be an element, like pure gold (Au), or a compound, like water (H2O), where the ratio of its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen in this case, is fixed. The elemental composition by mass for a compound is constant and matches with its chemical formula. For water, this implies that in any sample of it, 8/9 of the mass (or about 88.9%) will be oxygen, and 1/9 (or about 11.1%) will be hydrogen, because oxygen is 16 times heavier than hydrogen, and water molecules have twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms. # Mixtures On the other hand, a **mixture** is composed of two or more substances (elements or compounds) that are physically combined. The key characteristic of mixtures is that the proportion of their constituents can vary. Consider a mixture of ethanol and water. You could have a mixture that's 95% ethanol and 5% water by mass, or one that's 40% ethanol and 60% water by mass. These variations are possible because the substances in a mixture retain their individual properties and are not chemically bonded as they are in compounds. # Elemental Analysis in Mixtures **Elemental Analysis** is a method used in chemistry to determine the elemental composition by mass of a pure substance or to ascertain the proportions of elements in a mixture. This can be crucial for understanding the nature of a substance or a mixture. For mixtures, elemental analysis can illuminate the ratio of different components in the mixture by breaking down the total mass contribution of each element present. For example, if you analyze a mixture of table salt (NaCl) and water (H2O), the analysis could reveal the proportion of sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) in the mixture. From these elemental compositions by mass, and knowing the chemical formulas of the constituents, one could deduce the relative proportions of salt and water in the mixture. # Quantitative Relationship: Elemental Composition and Mixture Composition By understanding the elemental composition, one can calculate the composition of substances in a mixture. **Stoichiometry**, which involves the calculation of relative quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions, is fundamentally used here. It relies on the conservation of mass and the concept of moles (a measure of quantity in chemistry). For instance, if you know a mixture contains X grams of hydrogen and Y grams of oxygen, you can determine how much water could potentially be formed based on the stoichiometric requirements (2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms). This quantitative relationship is powerful because it enables chemists to predict and manipulate the results of chemical reactions and to understand the composition of mixtures in detail. In summary, the elemental composition by mass tells us the proportion of each element within a substance or mixture. By understanding these proportions, and how they relate to the chemical formulas of the components of a mixture, we can determine the specific makeup of that mixture. This is a foundational principle that enables chemists to formulate, analyze, and manipulate mixtures and pure substances in various fields, from pharmaceuticals to materials science."},{"instruction":"Essentials of Crafting Magnetic Instagram Reels: A Minimalist Guide to Digital Mastery, minimalist tone, generate SEO's, tips, how you can sell, strategies, platform to use to sell like stan store, keywords for instagram","output":"Crafting magnetic Instagram Reels requires a focused approach, blending storytelling with strategic content creation.

**高质量数据集**：确保训练数据中包含高分辨率、高质量的人脸图像，特别是包含清晰可见牙齿的图像。这可以帮助模型学习到如何生成更清晰的牙齿细节。 - **数据增强**：使用图像处理技术（如随机裁剪、缩放、旋转等）增强训练数据，特别是针对嘴部区域的增强，可以帮助模型更好地学习牙齿的细节表现。 b. 网络架构和损失函数 - **改进网络架构**：调整或优化Wav2Lip使用的神经网络架构，以便更好地捕获和表现细节信息，包括牙齿的细节。 - **损失函数优化**：使用能够更好评估细节清晰度的损失函数，比如结构相似性(SSIM)指标或感知损失，可以帮助模型在生成图像时更加注重细节的清晰度。 # 2. 后处理技术 即使模型本身的生成效果有限，利用后处理技术也可以在一定程度上提升牙齿的清晰度： - **超分辨率技术**：通过使用超分辨率技术（如ESRGAN等），可以将生成的视频帧进行上采样，增加其分辨率，获得更清晰的图像细节。 - **锐化和细节增强**：在视频的后处理阶段，可以应用图像锐化和细节增强算法来提升牙齿区域的清晰度和对比度，使牙齿看起来更加明显。 # 3. 结合域专家知识 在一些情况下，可以结合口腔科或牙齿美学方面的专家知识，对数据集进行特定的标注或调整，以及调整模型训练过程中强调牙齿特征的表示，从而提升生成视频中牙齿的自然度和清晰度。 总之，提升Wav2Lip生成视频中牙齿的清晰度是一项涉及多方面的任务，需要从提高模型的学习能力、增强数据集质量以及采用有效的后处理技术等多方面着手。"},{"instruction":"loss从l1改成l2游泳么","output":"在深度学习训练中，损失函数的选择对于模型的学习性能和最终结果有着直接的影响。L1损失（绝对误差）和L2损失（均方误差）是两种常用的损失函数，它们在处理不同类型的问题时各有优劣。如果你在问的是\\"使用L2损失会不会有所帮助（改进）\\"，下面是L1损失和L2损失在不同情况下表现的比较： # L1损失（绝对误差损失） - **定义**：(L1 = sum |y - hat{y}|)，其中(y)是真实值，(hat{y})是预测值。 - **特点**：对异常点（离群点）不太敏感，能稳定地训练。 - **适用场景**：当数据中存在很多异常点时，使用L1损失可以更好地进行回归分析。 # L2损失（均方误差损失） - **定义**：(L2 = sum (y - hat{y})^2)。 - **特点**：对异常点非常敏感，因为L2损失会将误差的平方进行累加，这意味着较大的误差值会受到更重的惩罚。 - **适用场景**：当数据中的异常点较少，且希望模型对数据拟合得更紧密时使用L2损失较为合适。 # L1改成L2效果如何？ - **梯度特性**：L2损失的梯度相对于误差的大小是线性增长的，意味着误差越大，梯度也越大，这可能导致在训练初期（当误差可能较大时）权重更新过快。而L1损失的梯度是常数，不会因为误差的大小而变化过多。 - **解的稀疏性**：L1损失倾向于产生稀疏的权重矩阵，即模型在训练过程中会自然地倾向于忽略数据中的一些特征。这在某种程度上可以起到特征选择的作用。而L2损失则倾向于分配小但非零的权重。 - **性能差异**：对于特定项目，L2损失可能帮助模型更好地拟合数据（尤其是在误差较小的情况下），减小过拟合的风险（通过权重衰减），但同时也让模型对异常点更加敏感。 最终，是否从L1改成L2损失应根据你的具体问题、数据特征以及模型的表现来决定。在一些情况下，使用L2损失相较于L1损失可以获得更平滑的模型和更好的预测性能，尤其是在回归问题中。然而，在存在很多离群点的情况下，L1损失可能是更好的选择。此外，实践中也常常采用L1和L2损失的组合，即所谓的Elastic Net回归，来结合两者的优点。"},{"instruction":"比如wav2lip中的重建损失从l1变成l2有效么","output":"在训练像Wav2Lip这样的模型时，将重建损失从L1损失改为L2损失，是否有效，取决于你希望模型达到什么样的效果以及数据集的特性。 # L1损失 (绝对误差损失) - **优点**：由于L1损失对误差的惩罚是线性的，它对异常值（噪声）更加稳健。在生成模型中，使用L1损失往往可以帮助模型生成更加锐利、细节更丰富的图像，因为它不会过度平滑结果。 - **缺点**：相较于L2损失，L1损失可能不会产生那么平滑的学习曲线，因为其对误差的导数是常数，可能导致在优化过程中遇到更多的挑战。 # L2损失 (均方误差损失) - **优点**：L2损失会对较大的误差给予更重的惩罚（由于平方项），这使得模型在训练时更加注重于减少大的预测误差，从而可能增加整体预测的准确度。在某些情况下，如当数据噪声较小且异常值较少时，使用L2损失可能会使重建的图像看起来更加平滑和自然。 - **缺点**：L2损失对异常值非常敏感，当数据中包含噪声时，模型可能会过度调整自己以适应这些噪声点，从而影响到泛化能力。 # Wav2Lip 的情况 Wav2Lip 模型的目的是生成与输入音频同步的口型。在这种情况下，生成结果的自然度和细节丰富度是非常重要的，因为你希望生成的视频看起来尽可能逼真。 - **如果**使用L1损失，可能有助于生成更为清晰、细节丰富的嘴唇和牙齿细节，这对于提升视频的真实感是非常有帮助的。 - **改用L2损失**，在理论上，可能会帮助模型在学习过程中更关注于减少大的误差，从而可能对于整体的嘴唇运动和形态有更好的重建效果，但有可能会牺牲一些细节的锐利度，使图像略微平滑。 建议的做法是，针对你的具体应用场景进行实验。你可以分别试验L1损失和L2损失，甚至它们的组合，比如L1和L2混合损失，以查看哪种方法在你的任务上表现得最好。实验证明是检验是否有效的唯一标准，不同的任务和数据集可能会导致不同的优化损失选择。"},{"instruction":"如果我想提升牙齿的清晰度，应该加什么loss","output":"如果你的目标是在使用类似Wav2Lip这样的视音频合成模型时提升生成图像中牙齿的清晰度，你可以考虑在损失函数中加入特定的损失项，专门用于提升牙齿区域的重建质量和清晰度。以下是一些建议： # 1. 细节增强损失（Detail Enhancement Loss） 在传统的L1或L2损失之外，加入一个额外的损失项，专门针对牙齿区域的细节增强。这可以基于图像的高频成分来实现，例如: - **高频细节损失**：可以使用拉普拉斯滤波器提取图像的高频分量（即细节部分），然后计算生成图像与真实图像高频分量之间的误差。 # 2. 感知损失（Perceptual Loss） 感知损失通过比较深层特征表示之间的差异而不仅仅是像素级差异，可以帮助模型生成视觉上更令人满意的结果。在牙齿重建的上下文中，可以这样使用感知损失： - **特定区域感知损失**：选择一个预先训练好的深度网络（例如VGG），通过这个网络前向传播生成图像和目标图像，并在特定的层上计算牙齿区域的特征差异。这样可以帮助模型学习到如何生成在感知上更接近真实牙齿的特征。 # 3. 结构相似性损失（Structural Similarity Index, SSIM） SSIM是一个衡量两个图像相似性的指标，它考虑亮度、对比度、结构信息。在牙齿清晰度提升的场景中，可以使用SSIM损失来强化牙齿区域的结构信息： - **区域SSIM损失**：特别计算牙齿区域的SSIM值，并将其作为损失函数的一部分。这有助于在保持牙齿区域结构信息的同时提升清晰度。 # 4. 对抗性损失（Adversarial Loss） 引入对抗性网络（GAN）的概念，通过一个判别器网络来鉴别生成图像的真实性。在牙齿清晰度的上下文中，可以这样使用： - **局部GAN**：设计一个针对牙齿区域的局部判别器，专注于评估牙齿的真实性和清晰度。生成器的目标是生成能够欺骗局部判别器的高清晰度牙齿图像。 # 实现提示 实现上述任何一个损失时，都需要准确地定义牙齿区域。这通常通过预标注的牙齿掩码或自动牙齿检测算法来实现。 结合这些损失函数可能需要一定的试验和错误，以确定最佳的权重和平衡点，使得模型既能生成高质量的牙齿细节，同时保持其他面部特征的自然和一致性。实践中，经常需要一个调优和实验过程来找到最适合你具体任务的损失函数组合。"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},G=["disabled"],N={key:0},q={key:1};function W(n,e,l,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
