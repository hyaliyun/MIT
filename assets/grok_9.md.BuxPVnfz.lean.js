Reuters - Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawiurged an Iraqi court Monday to speed up proceedings againsttoppled leader Saddam Hussein and his close aides. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a news report from Reuters regarding Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's appeal to an Iraqi court to expedite the legal proceedings against the former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and his close associates. The statement was made on Monday, although the exact date is not mentioned. Saddam Hussein, who ruled Iraq from 1979 to 2003, was known for his oppressive and brutal regime. He was eventually captured by the US forces in December 2003. Following his capture, a trial was initiated to bring him and his close aides to justice for their crimes against humanity and other violations of international law. Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi was part of the transitional government put in place after the fall of Saddam's regime to help oversee the restoration of stability and political order within Iraq. In this text, Allawi expresses his concerns over the slow pace of proceedings in court, possibly fearing that delays could lead to further tensions and unrest among the population. By urging the court to speed up the process, he aims to demonstrate the government's commitment to holding Saddam and his allies accountable for their actions while bringing a sense of closure for the Iraqi people who suffered under their rule. It is crucial to note that the underlying tone of the text also highlights the broader context of the political climate, international scrutiny, and the power dynamics in Iraq at the time. The call for faster proceedings could signify a desire to achieve justice swiftly and move forward from the trauma of the past, reinforcing the legitimacy of the interim government and ultimately facilitating the transition towards democracy and a more stable society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth.

It's also the 10th anniversary of the completion of the Human Genome Project, which set out to sequence the more than 3 billion letters in our genetic code. Biologist James Watson and physicist Francis Crick realized our DNA molecules form a three-dimensional double helix in 1953. But DNA research dates back to the late 1860s, according to Nature Education. Friedrich Miescher was the first to identify \\"nucleic acid\\" in our white blood cells; his 1869 finding was later named deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Others later defined the components that make up DNA molecules, identified RNA (ribonucleic acid, the other type of nucleic acid found in all cells along with DNA) and determined that although DNA differs in each species, it always maintains certain properties. Those findings led to Watson and Crick's conclusion, which paved the way for decades of DNA discoveries. Today we use DNA tests to tell us about all kinds of things -- from Justin Bieber's baby daddy status to the innocence of a man sitting on death row. But genetic scientists are doing more than trying to prove Bigfoot's existence. Here are five cool things DNA testing can do:. Map your family tree. A 99 DNA test could give you thousands of new relatives (although if they're anything like ours, we're not sure why you'd want them). Sites such as Ancestry.com offer to compare your DNA to those they already have on record in hopes of connecting you to unknown branches of your family tree. Ancestry.com's test can also tell you your genetic ethnicity. \\"The new test looks at a massive amount of your DNA ... and compares it to other DNA samples from around the world. By detecting similarities, we can trace back generations to connect you to the lands your ancestors once called home,\\" the site states. Solve ancient mysteries. No one knew where Richard III, one of the most famous kings of England, was buried until his remains were discovered in a parking lot in Leicester. The remains showed evidence of battle wounds and scoliosis, but scientists weren't sure the skeleton was Richard III's until DNA extracted from the bones was matched to Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of the king's sister. It wasn't the first time ancient remains had been identified using DNA. If it's stored in a cold, dry, dark place, DNA can last for thousands of years. In 2009, a DNA analysis of some bone fragments showed two of Czar Nicholas II's children were killed along with the rest of the family during the Russian Revolution, despite speculation they could have escaped. Scientists have even extracted DNA from Neanderthals, who went extinct about 30,000 years ago, in hopes of gaining insight into the evolution of humans. Shakespeare, thou art stored in DNA. Distinguish your mutt. \\"Where does Buddy get his curly tail from? Why does he love digging holes in the backyard? Could I be doing more to make him happier and healthier? Your dog may not be able to tell you the answers -- but his DNA can,\\" claims one dog DNA site, WisdomPanel.com. You'll probably never figure out why Buddy loves to eat your favorite Italian pumps (other than the fact he's a dog) but you can figure out where he comes from. WisdomPanel.com will test your mutt's DNA against that of more than 190 breeds to determine his genetic background. \\"But why?\\" cat lovers may be asking. \\"When you understand your dog's natural tendencies, you can tailor a training, exercise and nutrition program to his needs,\\" the site explains. Predict the future. Using blood from the mother and saliva from the father, scientists can now determine whether a fetus has any chromosomal abnormalities that could cause a genetic disorder. For example, DNA testing can reveal if an unborn baby will have trisomy 21, or Down syndrome. Researchers are beginning to expand the field of prenatal genetic testing even further, using it to identify potential developmental delays and intellectual disabilities such as autism. Genetic testing can also reveal risk factors you may have inherited from your parents, such as a high risk for breast or colon cancer. While this genetic risk factor does not guarantee you will get the disease, it does increase your chances; knowing about the risk may help you take preventive steps. Help you lose weight. A growing body of research suggests that our ability to lose weight -- or gain 10 pounds by simply looking at a piece of chocolate -- is shaped in large part by our genes. Scientists have identified several gene variants that may predispose us, and our children, to obesity. Rodent studies have also shown that up to 80% of body fat is regulated by our genes, according to TIME. That said, we wouldn't search for a customized DNA Diet just yet. While there is a genetic component to obesity, our understanding of it is limited, says CNN diet and fitness expert Dr. Melina Jampolis. Researchers are still trying to figure out how genetics, nutrition and exercise are related so we can help people lose weight and keep it off. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Happy National DNA Day! This day celebrates the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by scientists James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, as well as the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. DNA is a very important part of our body and helps us know many things about ourselves. Here are five cool things DNA testing can do: 1. Map your family tree: DNA tests can help you find your long-lost relatives and learn about your genetic background. 2. Solve ancient mysteries: Scientists can use DNA from old bones to learn about people who lived a long time ago, like kings and queens. 3. Learn about your dog: By testing your dog's DNA, you can find out what breed they are and understand their behavior better. 4. Predict the future: DNA tests can tell us about the health of unborn babies and if they may have certain medical conditions. 5. Help you lose weight: Our genes can affect how easily we gain or lose weight, so understanding our DNA can help us find the best way to stay healthy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: The largest population centres of the Sinhalese diaspora are mainly situated in Europe, North America and Australia. The city of Melbourne contains just under half of the Sri Lankan Australians. The 2011 census recorded 86,412 Sri Lanka born in Australia. There are 73,849 Australians (0.4 of the population) who reported having Sinhalese ancestry in 2006. The Sinhalese language was also reported to be the 29th-fastest-growing language in Australia (ranking above Somali language but behind Hindi language and Belarusian language). Sinhalese Australians have an exceptionally low rate of return migration to Sri Lanka. In the Canada 2011 Census, 7,220 people identified themselves as of Sri Lankan Canadians, out of 139,415 Sri Lankans. There are a small amount of Sri Lankans in India, scattered around the country, but mainly living in and around the North India and South India regions. Sri Lankan New Zealanders comprised 3% of the Asian population of New Zealand in 2001. The numbers arriving continued to increase, and at the 2006 census there were over 7,000 Sri Lankans living in New Zealand. The Sri Lankan American number about 12,000 in the U.S. The New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States, receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population, followed by Central New Jersey and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Many Sri Lankans in Italy have migrated to Italy since the 1970s. Italy was attractive to the Sinhalese due to perceived easier employment opportunities and entry, compared to other European countries. It is estimated that there are 30,000-33,000 Sinhalese in Italy. The major Sinhalese communities in Italy are located in Lombardia (In the districts Loreto and Lazzaretto), Milan, Lazio, Rome, Naples, and Southern Italy (Particularly Palermo, Messina and Catania). Though British Sri Lankans people in particular and Sri Lankans in general have migrated to the UK over the centuries beginning from the colonial times, the number of Sinhalese people in the UK cannot be estimated accurately due to inadequacies of census in the UK.

He also placed a corps of his own troops under Frederick's command This turn of events has become known as the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg. Frederick was then able to muster a larger army of 120,000 men and concentrate it against Austria. He drove them from much of Saxony, while his brother Henry won a victory in Silesia in the Battle of Freiberg (29 October 1762). At the same time, his Brunswick allies captured the key town of Göttingen and compounded this by taking Cassel. Q: How many troops did Frederick have left?","output":"Frederick had 60,000 men left in his Prussian armies at the time when his survival was severely threatened and Berlin was under siege. After the Russian Empress Elizabeth died and her successor Peter III recalled the Russian armies and offered support to Frederick, he was able to muster a larger army of 120,000 men to concentrate on fighting against Austria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: To open a letter very neatly without ruining the envelope when you don't have a letter opener,","output":"Opening a letter neatly without ruining the envelope can be a bit tricky if you don't have access to a letter opener. However, there are several other methods you can use to achieve this goal. Here is a detailed and long answer: 1. Using your hands: a) Hold the envelope horizontally, with the sealed flap facing up. b) Gently run your finger under the flap, starting from one corner of the envelope and working your way across to the other corner. Apply slight pressure to loosen the adhesive. c) Once the adhesive is weakened, use the thumb and index finger of your dominant hand to grip the flap's corner you started at, while using your other hand to hold the body of the envelope firmly. d) Slowly and carefully open the flap, moving from one corner to the other with a steady hand to avoid tearing the paper. 2. Using a butter knife or a similar blunt tool: a) Hold the envelope horizontally with the sealed flap facing up. b) Choose a butter knife or another blunt-edged tool for this method. The tool should be thin enough but not too sharp to avoid cutting the envelope.  c) Gently slide the blunt edge of the tool under the flap a little away from one corner, and rock it back and forth gently to loosen the adhesive. Be sure not to force the tool under the flap, as this may cause tearing. d) Once the edge is loosened, slide the tool along the seam of the sealed flap, carefully separating the adhesive all the way to the other corner. e) Use your hands or the knife to carefully lift the flap open, ensuring it doesn't tear. 3. Using a plastic card (like a credit card): a) Hold the envelope horizontally with the flap facing up. b) Take a plastic card, such as a credit card or an ID card, and make sure it has no rough or sharp edges that can damage the envelope. c) Gently insert the card under the flap a little away from one corner. Push the card carefully but firmly along the seam of the flap, separating the adhesive without damaging the paper. d) As you reach the other corner, the flap's adhesive should be loose enough that you can carefully open the envelope without tearing it.  4. Softening the adhesive with steam: a) Boil water in a kettle, or heat water in a pan until it produces steam. b) Hold the sealed envelope flap above the steam, with a safe distance of about 5-6 inches away to avoid burns. The steam causes the adhesive to soften, making it easier to open without tearing. c) Periodically check the adhesive by gently poking the flap. You'll notice that it starts to give in. This process may take a couple of minutes, so be patient. d) Once the adhesive is softened enough, pull the flap open using your hands with the utmost care. Remember, the key to opening a letter without ruining the envelope is patience and gentle, precise movements. Taking your time and using one of the mentioned methods will help you achieve a neatly opened, unblemished envelope."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Your job is to determine which sentence(s) from the passage can be used to search for further information needed to answer the question. Problem:Question: In which country was the battle fought where O'Connor commanded the VIII Corps? Passage:General Sir Richard Nugent O'Connor, (21 August 1889 – 17 June 1981) was a senior British Army officer who fought in both the First and Second World Wars, and commanded the Western Desert Force in the early years of the Second World War. He was the field commander for Operation Compass, in which his forces destroyed a much larger Italian army – a victory which nearly drove the Axis from Africa, and in turn, led Adolf Hitler to send the German Africa Corps under Erwin Rommel to try to reverse the situation. O'Connor was captured by a German reconnaissance patrol during the night of 7 April 1941 and spent over two years in an Italian prisoner of war camp. He eventually escaped after the fall of Mussolini in the autumn of 1943. In 1944 he commanded VIII Corps in the Battle of Normandy and later during Operation Market Garden. In 1945 he was General Officer in Command of the Eastern Command in India and then, in the closing days of British rule in the subcontinent, he headed Northern Command. His final job in the army was Adjutant-General to the Forces in London, in charge of the British Army's administration, personnel and organisation. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identify the question's main focus. Usage: In which country was the battle fought where O'Connor commanded the VIII Corps? The main focus here is to find the country where O'Connor commanded the VIII Corps and a battle was fought.

BACKGROUND According to willingness of the Ministry of Health, Iran and presence of appropriate conditions for disease elimination, national malaria control program decided to conduct a research to clarify malaria status in 2007 and to provide required information to perform the elimination program. This review is comprised of the basis of national malaria elimination program in vision of 2025, which was started in 2010.     METHODS In this descriptive study, data were analyzed by applications of different variables at district level. All districts in the three south eastern provinces, in which malaria has local transmission, were considered. Malaria cases has been determined and studied based on the national malaria surveillance system.     RESULTS Since vivax malaria is predominant in Sistan & Baluchestan Province, number of vivax cases is equal to malaria positive cases approximately. The important point is that Nikshahr contains the maximum number of local vivax cases in this province and the maximum number of falciparum cases is reported from Sarbaz district. Among all districts of Hormozgan Province, no case of autochthonous falciparum was detected except in Bandar Jask and one case in Minab. There was no case of autochthonous falciparum in Kerman Province, except in Kahnoj and Ghale Ganj that each of them had one case in 2007.     CONCLUSION It appears that the report of locally transmitted cases in Iran is increasing over the past few years, before starting malaria elimination plan. Since the Afghan refugees started to return to their own country so the main source of reporting of imported malaria cases reduced and local cases would be demonstrated more clearly.","output":"Part 1: Topic sentence (or key sentence) in the abstract.

(Photo: Scott Kelly/Twitter)      Just over a year ago, astronaut Scott Kelly left Earth to spend a year at the International Space Station. He returns late Tuesday night.      Kelly shared one of his last sunrises Saturday morning, claiming it to be one of the best— and that's saying a lot since the International Space Station goes around the Earth so quickly that day and night come every 92 minutes, Kelly tweeted in September.

Let's take a look at some of his raddest photos.      He flew over Texas two months into his trip and spotted a storm coming in.      This stunning photo of the Milky Way came soon after to celebrate Hubble's 25th Anniversary.      Chicago looks beautiful with the unusual sight of the Aurora Borealis in the background.

Sure, we didn't walk on the Moon, but we did have a very close encounter with Pluto, grew crops in space, and started the hiring process for the first manned mission to Mars. And through it all, astronaut Scott Kelly has been orbiting Earth on the International Space Station, providing us with incredible images and setting the American record for the most time in space.      Sadly all good things must come to an end, and in preparation for his departure back to Earth on March 1, Kelly handed over command of the International Space Station to NASA astronaut Tim Kopra just a few hours ago. For anyone like us who's followed the almost year-long journey of Kelly and cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko so far, the ceremony below is pretty emotional.      Even if you haven't heard of the record-breaking Year in Space mission until now, you have to admit that spending 340 days straight on a spacecraft roughly the size of a football field is pretty impressive - not to mention the fact that Kelly drank an estimated 730 Litres of his own sweat and urine during the mission - all so he could help scientists back on Earth figure out what long-term space travel does to the body.      In the ceremony, Kelly thanks Kornienko ('Misha' for short) and admits goodbyes are always \\"bittersweet when you're leaving this incredible place\\". Kornienko will be travelling back to Earth on March 1 along with Kelly and cosmonaut Sergey Volkov, who's been on the space station with them for the past six months.      \\"Obviously, you know, Misha and I have been up here for a really, really long time and recently we've been joking with each other that we'll say something like 'We did it!' or 'We made it!'\\" says Kelly in the ceremony below. \\"But we both recognise that this is a lot more about teamwork and all the people that it takes to put these missions together and be successful than it is about us.\\"      \\"Spaceflight is the biggest team sport there is, and it's incredibly important that we all work together to make what is seemingly impossible possible,\\" he adds.      No, we're not crying, it's just allergies.      Once Kelly lands, NASA scientists will begin to assess the toll that space has had on his body, and compare him closely with his twin brother Mark Kelly, who stayed firmly on Earth throughout the year in space.      What we learn about the impact of microgravity and space travel during such long missions will help us better understand how to keep humans healthy on the way to Mars - and maybe one day even further into the Solar System.      As NASA control tells Kelly and Kornienko at the end of the handover: \\"What you have provided for our human spaceflight endeavours has been monumental ... We look forward to seeing you back safe on the ground and back in Houston.\\"      Here's a hero, signing off: ||||| One year ago, NASA embarked on its very own astronaut twin experiment. Scott Kelly shot up to the International Space Station while his identical-except-for-the-mustache twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly1, stayed firmly planted on Earth.      Now on March 1, after 340 days in orbit, Kelly-the-spacebound is coming home. Riding inside the snug Soyuz back with him will be fellow year-in-space resident, cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko.      But back to the twins (sorry, Mikhail), because that’s one of the most exciting parts of this year-in-space adventure. While Kelly-the-Earthbound wasn’t spending time munching space lettuce or drinking space coffee or doing important astronaut stuff, he was collecting blood, urine, saliva, and poop—for science! At the same time, NASA has been taking samples from his identical twin. By comparing the data, scientists hope to get a better handle on what happens to human bodies in space.      One year is twice as long as the typical ISS trip—but it is how long astronauts will have to spend in interplanetary space to get to Mars and back. That’s one year for the body to slowly break down in space thanks too little gravity and too much radiation.      Some of the effects of microgravity are obvious. When bones and muscles no longer have to bear the weight of walking, they start to weaken. Bones thin, muscles atrophy. To counteract that, ISS astronauts spend an average of two hours a day exercising, strapped onto a treadmill with elastic bands or doing weight resistance training. Supplements like vitamin D also help. But still, astronauts lose on average 1.5 percent of their bone mass per month in space.      Less obvious are the effects of gravity on fluids. Yes, your internal fluids! Like your blood and urine and the all the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells of your body.      Without gravity, for example, the heart shrinks because it no longer has to work as hard to pump blood to the legs and back. It also accounts for the Charlie Brown effect, where fluids in the face make astronauts more round-cheeked than they typically are on Earth. This makes it harder to smell food, but more seriously, also harder to see. Swollen tissues in the head put pressure on the optic nerve, leading to decreased vision. To counteract some of this, NASA has a device called a chabis, basically an uncomfortable-looking pair of pants that pull fluids back down to the legs.      Cosmic radiation is another very present danger. The ISS sits low enough in Earth’s orbit that it still enjoys some protection from the Earth’s mass and magnetic field; out in space en route to Mars, radiation becomes an even more pressing problem. NASA needs to find out exactly how big of a dose of space radiation is dangerous.      When Scott Kelly touches down on Earth, most of the data collecting part of the twin study will be over. But analyzing the data will have only just begun.      1UPDATE 1:15PM ET 2/29/16: This story has been updated with the correct name for Scott Kelly's brother, Mark Kelly. ||||| In this Jan. 21, 2016 photo made available by NASA, one-year mission crew members Scott Kelly of NASA, left, and Mikhail Kornienko of Roscosmos celebrate their 300th consecutive day in space. By spending... (Associated Press)      CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — As soon as he returns from the International Space Station, NASA's first and only yearlong spaceman, Scott Kelly, will try to pop up from a lying position and stand still for three minutes.      He'll take a crack at a mini-obstacle course and attempt to walk a straight line, heel to toe — all so researchers can see whether he'd hit the ground running if this were Mars instead of Earth.      NASA considers it crucial prep work for future Mars explorers who will have to spend much longer in space and won't have the help of a welcoming committee. In fact, this mission — which began with a launch last March — is all about Mars.      \\"I think we'll learn a lot about longer-duration spaceflight and how that will take us to Mars someday,\\" Kelly said Thursday in his final news conference from orbit. \\"So I'd like to think that this is another of many steppingstones to us landing on Mars sometime in our future.\\"      Kelly's 340-day mission — the longest by 125 days for NASA — comes to a dramatic end Wednesday on the remote steppes of Kazakhstan. (It will be Tuesday night in the U.S.) The astronaut will ride a Soyuz spacecraft back with two Russians, including Mikhail Kornienko, his roommate for the past year.      Once out of the capsule, the two will submit to a multitude of field tests.      What could new arrivals do on Mars, asks Dr. Stevan Gilmore, the lead flight surgeon who will be at the landing site to receive Kelly. Could they jump up and down? Could they open a hatch? Could they do an immediate spacewalk?      The tests on Kelly and Kornienko should provide some answers. There will also be blood draws, heart monitoring and other medical exams. The testing will continue for weeks if not months once they're back home in Houston and at cosmonaut headquarters at Star City, Russia.      Checkups will also continue for Kelly's identical twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. The 52-year-old brothers joined forces to provide NASA with a potential gold mine of scientific data: one twin studied for a year in orbit — twice the usual space station stay — while his genetic double underwent similar tests on the ground.      While a handful of Russians have spent longer in space, the record being a 438-day flight, those expeditions date back to the 1980s and 1990s aboard the Mir space station, rustic if not rickety compared with the current space station. Medical testing was spotty back then, and the data weren't always widely shared.      As of Thursday — Day 335 — Kelly professed to feeling pretty good. Indeed, flight surgeon Gilmore doesn't expect any alarming results at touchdown.      Kelly's vision has degraded a bit as it did during his last mission, a normal outcome for some astronauts because of increased pressure inside the skull in weightlessness. He anticipates his bones and muscles have weakened as well, despite daily exercise in orbit.      The real question mark — and Kelly's biggest concern — is the possible lingering effects of space radiation.      \\"Hopefully, I'll never find out what the true effects are of that,\\" Kelly said in a TV interview last week. NASA will need to tackle the problem for Mars trips because of the increased level of exposure.      Johnson Space Center physiologist John Charles puts the psychological side of long-duration spaceflight right up there with radiation, as well as in-flight medical care and even food preservation and packaging for the long haul.      \\"Just about everything is a big problem for Mars,\\" Charles said in a phone interview.      Mars expeditions planned for the 2030s will last 2½ years; the anticipated crew size will be four to six. The astronauts will almost certainly have to grow some of their own food; that's the reason for an experimental greenhouse aboard the space station.      Kelly and his crewmates grew red romaine lettuce in the mini-hothouse last summer and sampled some of the crop.      Even more impressive, Kelly nursed zinnias back to health in January, displaying a lush orange and yellow bouquet on Valentine's Day. He had to \\"channel my inner Mark Watney\\" — the lone astronaut who survives on potatoes in last year's blockbuster movie \\"The Martian\\" — to save the zinnias from mold.      Trust me when to add water, Kelly urged Mission Control, not some preflight script. That's how it will need to be when astronauts venture to Mars, he gently reminded everyone.      Charles stresses that Mars travel will be different than a space station stay. No regular phone chats with the husbands, wives and kids back home. No constant whispering in the astronauts' ears from Mission Control. Support would come via email.      \\"They're going to be highly autonomous,\\" Charles said of the Mars explorers, \\"and that's something that we're trying to practice on the space station now ... learning how to get Mission Control out of the back pockets of the astronauts.\\"      Kelly points out that crew quarters on Mars-bound craft will be much tighter than the space station — and nothing like the spaceships of science fiction. Between sleeping and working on his laptop, Kelly estimates he's spent almost half his time inside his personal cubicle — about the size of a phone booth.      NASA will need to improve privacy on Mars missions, he said, if it hopes to combat crew stress and fatigue.      The toughest part for Kelly has been the physical isolation from everyone he loves, 250 miles below him. But on a trip to Mars, tens of millions of miles away, astronauts won't be able to even see Earth.      \\"Obviously going to Mars, there are a lot of other challenges, but none of these we can't overcome,\\" Kelly said.      NASA is discussing doing more one-year flights with the other countries involved in the station program; more subjects are needed for a better understanding of all the challenges. It's a long time, no matter how you cut it. Just ask Kelly, who recently acknowledged, \\"a year now seems longer than I thought it would be.\\"      ___      Online:      NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/1ym/ ||||| This collaborative project is an extension of the 2016 End of Term project, intended to document the federal government's web presence by archiving government websites and data.

He also departs with a record as a social media maven and renowned photographer from space.      Kelly made four trips to space, the most prominent being a 340-day journey that ended last month. During that flight, Kelly made more than 5,000 trips around the Earth, and drank nearly 200 gallons of drinking water made from recycled sweat and urine.      From his perch 400 kilometers (249 miles) above the earth’s surface, he snapped hundreds of beautifully abstract photographs of our planet’s landforms and waterways. He spotted hurricanes ominously swirling on sapphire-blue oceans. He gazed out at the aurora’s glittering fog. He consistently turned Earth’s lands and waters into an abstract artist’s dream, with shots of beaches, deserts, forests, and everything in between.      And he did it all with equipment accessible to earthlings, taking most of his images with a Nikon D4 digital camera with lenses more commonly used to photograph football games.      Kelly’s photographs gained him a massive following. From Twitter to Tumblr, hundreds of thousands of social media users expressed their wonderment at the photos—and a devoted band of mapping experts tagged along, helpfully noting where Kelly snapped his pics.      “It’s fun to be a part of the public’s reaction,” says David MacLean of Nova Scotia Community College’s Centre of Geographic Sciences, who’s among the most influential of Kelly’s hobbyist geotaggers.      MacLean has been mapping astronauts’ photos since 2013, but says Kelly’s penchant for abstraction sets his pictures apart.      “Other astronauts have more of a city and regional view: ‘Here’s Indianapolis from space,’” MacLean says. Kelly, on the other hand, “has concentrated on details of little pieces of the world.”      “He’s caught the interest of quite a lot of people, [who] see these [places] in a whole new way.”      And Kelly’s eye for composition hasn’t gone unnoticed at National Geographic.      “Kelly’s photographs are striking and incredibly artistic,\\" wrote Patrick Witty, National Geographic’s deputy director of photography. “[It’s] hard to believe they were made by an astronaut and not a working professional photographer.”      “I’m sure every photographer on Earth is incredibly jealous of his angle.”      To celebrate Kelly’s #YearInSpace, we’ve selected our favorite Scott Kelly space pictures. We hope you enjoy the photos—and check out National Geographic's photographic coverage of Kelly’s final return to Earth. |||||Summary:","output":"After spending 340 consecutive days in space, astronaut Scott Kelly returned from his International Space Station mission.

Eating dinner together with family is an activity that goes beyond simple nourishment; it also entails social bonding, sharing stories, and strengthening relationships. This is particularly true in instances like this one, where preparing the meal itself is a joyful and communal experience. Given the positive interaction between Lee and his father, it can be inferred that they are looking forward to not only consuming the food but also relishing in the company and connection that comes with sharing the meal. Therefore, in concluding, it is reasonable to assume that \\"eat dinner\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What will Lee want to do next?\\", given that he and his father have just spent quality time laughing and preparing dinner together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This happens when dead plants, animals, and microorganisms settle at the bottom of a body of water, such as an ocean or lake, forming an organic-rich layer. This layer is mixed with and often trapped within inorganic sediments like mud, clay, and sand. As more sediment is deposited on top of the organic material, it becomes buried deeper in the earth, leading to the subsequent steps of the process. These steps are: 1. Accumulation and deposition of organic matter in a sedimentary environment (the missing first step). 2. Over time, more sediment piles on top, increasing the pressure and temperature on the buried organic material. 3. The resulting heat and pressure transform the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen. 4. Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack or break due to the continuous increase in temperature and pressure. 5. The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. 6.

A volleyed goal from substitute Tadanari Lee in the second half of extra time earned Japan a 1-0 victory over Australia and a record fourth Asian Cup Saturday. Lee hammered home a cross from Yugo Nagatomo in the 109th minute to settle the clash and leave Holgar Osieck's Australia heartbroken at Qatar's Khalifa International Stadium. The Socceroos had twice gone close with Everton's Tim Cahill having an effort cleared off the line and winger Harry Kewell firing straight at goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima when clean through on goal. But Alberto Zaccheroni's \\"Blue Samurai\\" weathered the storm to add to their previous triumphs in 1992, 2000 and 2004 as Lee proved their hero. With 20 minutes left Kewell spurned his chance when one-on-one with Kawashima and as the game drifted towards extra-time,","output":"Australia seemed to be growing in confidence. The Socceroos had controlled possession for large parts of the match and looked to use their physicality to wear down the Japanese side. Throughout the game, both Kewell and Cahill were constant threats for Australia, but the Blue Samurai remained disciplined in defense, largely thanks to the efforts of captain Makoto Hasebe and defender Yasuyuki Konno. As the match entered extra time, the level of intensity increased on both sides. Nagatomo and Shinji Okazaki had chances to score for Japan, but were denied by Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Meanwhile, Australia continued to create chances of their own, with Mile Jedinak and Robbie Kruse coming close, but ultimately, they were unable to break the deadlock. It was then, in the second half of extra time, that the game's decisive moment arrived. In the 109th minute, Nagatomo, who had been a constant threat down Japan's left flank throughout the match, found himself with space to deliver a pinpoint cross. Lee, who had been introduced as a substitute only 10 minutes earlier, met the ball with a thunderous volley, giving Schwarzer no chance as the ball hit the back of the net. It was a sublime finish that highlighted the quality of the Japanese side. The goal sent the Japanese supporters into euphoria, while the Australian players, who had given their all throughout the match, were left devastated. Despite the Socceroos' valiant efforts and numerous chances, they simply could not find a way past Kawashima and Japan's solid defense. As the final whistle blew, Japan were crowned champions for a record fourth time - an achievement that underlined the team's growing stature on the continent and the global football stage. The victory was also significant for Japan's Italian coach, Alberto Zaccheroni, who had taken charge of the team less than a year earlier. His tactical acumen and the players' determination proved vital in securing the Asian Cup title. In the end, Lee's goal proved to be the defining moment of the match and etched his name in Asian Cup history. The victory demonstrated Japan's strength and their status as the powerhouse of Asian football, while Australia, although disappointed, could take pride in their performance and their progress in the tournament. The thrilling finale to the 2011 Asian Cup showcased the exciting talent and potential of both teams and served as a fitting conclusion to a hard-fought and memorable edition of the competition."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please briefly summarize this news article: State of the Series: Rangers go back home down 0-2 SAN FRANCISCO -- Everything has gone according to plan for the San Francisco Giants. They've won one game with outstanding hitting and another with lock-down pitching. The Texas Rangers, meanwhile, will be looking for some home cooking to help get them back in the World Series. But history is against them. The last 14 times one team has taken a 2-0 lead in the World Series, that team has gone on to hoist the trophy 13 times. \\"It's nice to get the first two,\\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said after a 9-0 victory Thursday night, \\"but that's what it is. You've got to get to this number before your next number.\\" Of course, the Giants have had the Rangers' number so far in this series. They're hitting just .231 as a team after Matt Cain and Co. shut them down in Game 2. \\"I think that's more or less has to do with the pitching we've been facing,\\" said Texas manager Ron Washington. \\"You know those guys were good, especially Cain tonight. …I think you have to tip your hat to the pitching over there right now.\\" For the American League champions to bounce back, they'll have to show some of the potent offense that carried them past the New York Yankees in the ALCS. So where do the Rangers turn for solace? Perhaps in the fact that they were only a bounce from taking the early lead in Game 2. In the top of the fifth, Ian Kinsler's fly ball to deep center field hit the top of the wall and bounced back into play. He had to settle for a leadoff double and never came around to score. \\"We're getting guys on base, we're just not knocking them in,\\" said Texas third baseman Michael Young. \\"We keep getting guys on, then I like our chances of getting them in. We're just too good an offense not to.\\" The stats bear him out. In Game 2, the Rangers were 0-for-9 with runners in scoring position and they left nine men on base. In an 11-7 loss in Game 1, they left eight men on. The real problem may lie in the Rangers pitching. Game 2 starter C.J. Wilson was effective -- giving up only one run before walking the leadoff batter in the seventh and leaving with a blister problem. But the Giants have teed off on Texas relievers, averaging 10 runs per game in their formerly pitching-friendly home park. Now the Series moves to Texas, where the hits are usually expected to keep on comin'. After a travel day on Friday, Colby Lewis, who shut down the New York Yankees in winning the ALCS clincher, will be on the mound for the Rangers against Giants left-hander Jonathan Sanchez.","output":"The San Francisco Giants have taken a 2-0 lead in the World Series against the Texas Rangers, demonstrating impressive hitting and pitching, while the Rangers are struggling to keep up. With history against them, the Rangers need to show the potent offense they displayed during the American League Championship to increase their chances of winning. While their batters have managed to get on base, they have fallen short in bringing players home. Adding to their concerns is the performance of their pitchers, particularly their relievers who have given up an average of 10 runs per game. To bounce back, the Rangers will rely on their home advantage as the Series moves to Texas, with Colby Lewis aiming for a repeat performance of his winning efforts in the American League Championship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to French: Foundations of State authority at the local level 47 - 49 10","output":"Les fondements de l'autorité de l'État au niveau local 47 - 49 10 Il est important de reconnaître que les fondements de l'autorité de l'État au niveau local sont la pierre angulaire de l'organisation et du fonctionnement du gouvernement dans de nombreux pays. En France, par exemple, l'administration territoriale est constituée d'une série de niveaux allant des communes et des départements jusqu'aux régions et à l'État lui-même. Chaque niveau de gouvernement joue un rôle clé dans la façon dont les politiques sont élaborées et mises en œuvre et, par conséquent, dans la manière dont les services sont fournis à la population. La constitution française a établi un certain nombre de principes fondamentaux concernant l'autorité de l'État au niveau local. Le principe général de la décentralisation est consacré dans la constitution, reconnaissant que les collectivités territoriales sont libres de gérer leurs affaires en fonction de leurs compétences propres. En outre, l'autonomie financière des collectivités territoriales est également garantie par la constitution, leur permettant de disposer des ressources fiscales nécessaires pour s'acquitter de leurs missions. Le chiffre 47 correspond à la compétence des communes, les unités administratives qui constituent la base du système local français. Les communes sont responsables de l'administration et de la gestion des affaires locales, y compris la fourniture de services tels que la voirie, l'éducation, la santé publique et l'urbanisme. Les maires sont élus à la tête des communes, et ceux-ci travaillent avec des conseils municipaux composés d'élus locaux pour prendre les décisions affectant la communauté. Le chiffre 49 fait référence à la compétence des départements, qui sont un niveau de gouvernement intermédiaire entre les communes et les régions. Les départements sont responsables de questions telles que la protection sociale, les transports et l'équipement, ainsi que certaines infrastructures. Les conseils départementaux, composés de conseillers départementaux élus au suffrage universel direct, sont chargés de prendre les décisions pour ces domaines de compétence. Le chiffre 10, quant à lui, peut être interprété comme un rappel du fait qu'en France, il existe également d'autres niveaux d'autorité de l'État au niveau local. Parmi ceux-ci se trouvent les régions, qui sont responsables de l'aménagement du territoire, du développement économique et des formations professionnelles, et les établissements publics de coopération intercommunale (EPCI), qui regroupent plusieurs communes pour collaborer sur des projets d'intérêt commun. En résumé, les fondements de l'autorité de l'État au niveau local en France sont constitués par une série de niveaux de gouvernement, dont les communes, les départements, les régions et divers autres types de collectivités territoriales. Chacun de ces niveaux joue un rôle important dans le fonctionnement du gouvernement local et permet de répondre aux besoins spécifiques des citoyens dans différentes domaines. Les chiffres 47, 49 et 10 correspondent respectivement aux compétences et responsabilités des communes, des départements et d'autres niveaux d'autorité de l'État au niveau local."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choices:  - roof - ground - park - surface of earth - windowsill  The rationale to choose \\"windowsill\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The optimal location for ensuring your plants receive adequate sunlight is the windowsill, and here's why: 1. Direct access to sunlight: Windowsills provide direct access to sunlight, allowing plants to receive the necessary light they need to conduct photosynthesis. By placing plants by the window, you ensure that they can benefit from the sun's rays during the day. 2. Convenient and space-efficient: Windowsills are usually found within homes, making them extremely convenient for plant placement. This location also allows for efficient utilization of vertical space, which can be helpful for individuals with limited room for their plants. 3. Easy to monitor and care for: Having your plants on a windowsill makes it easy for you to monitor their growth and health. You can quickly assess their needs, such as watering or fertilizing, without having to venture outside. 4. Climate control: By placing your plants indoors, you can better control the environment in which they grow. This means that your plants will not be subjected to harsh outdoor conditions like heavy rain, strong winds, or extreme temperatures, which could potentially harm them. In comparison, options like the roof, ground, park, and surface of the earth often imply outdoor placement and can expose your plants to unfavorable environmental conditions and a lack of consistent access to sunlight.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who resigned the chairmanship of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee as a result of an argument before the 1900 campaign?  Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Summarize: Texts seen by the BBC suggest ex-IAAF consultant Papa Massata Diack, now wanted by Interpol, secured votes for Lord Coe's August election win. The programme also suggests Coe may have misled the UK parliament. The double British Olympic 1500m champion, 59, denies any wrongdoing. The text messages suggest Diack, son of the disgraced former IAAF president Lamine Diack, helped secure African delegate votes for Coe. The investigation also uncovers evidence Coe may have misled a parliamentary select committee over when he first became aware of the allegations of doping and corruption in athletics. Coe became IAAF president in the midst of a growing corruption scandal involving blackmail and state-sponsored doping in Russia. Within weeks of his election, his predecessor, Diack Sr, was arrested and a warrant issued for the arrest of his son, a marketing consultant for the IAAF. The corruption scandal had originally come to light in a German television documentary in December 2014. The documentary reported that Russian and IAAF officials, including Diack Jr, had conspired to cover up doping by the Russian marathon runner Lilya Shobukhova, as well as attempt to blackmail her. Media playback is not supported on this device Coe was not personally caught up in any of the doping or corruption allegations, but he had been a member of the IAAF council since 2003 and a vice-president since 2007. He was asked by MPs at a meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee last year why he had not been more prominent in pressing the doping issue while he was a vice-president. He told them: \\"I was certainly not aware of the specific allegations that had been made around the corruption of anti-doping processes in Russia.\\" When he was asked if he was aware of allegations against Diack Jr, Coe replied: \\"Well, they were allegations that were aired in the ARD documentary.\\" But evidence seen by the BBC and the Daily Mail reveals that, four months before the German television documentary was broadcast, an email was sent to Coe containing a number of attachments detailing the corruption, extortion and bribery claims, as well as the suggestion Diack Jr could have been involved. The attachments included a detailed complaint from the agent of Shobukhova, alleging she had paid Russian and IAAF officials 450,000 euro (£356,000) to cover up her doping and allow her to run in the London 2012 Olympics. Damian Collins MP, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: \\"I think his (Lord Coe's) answer to the select committee was deliberately misleading to create the impression that he was totally unaware of any specific allegations of this kind. \\"These involved serious criminal matters. The right thing to do would be to put that information into the hands of the criminal authorities straight away.\\" He added: \\"If he won't be drawn on the past and what he knew and can't come up with a compelling argument for the way he conducted himself, then I don't see how he could continue as president of the IAAF because he would lack the public support to do so.\\" In a statement, Coe, who won 1500m gold at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, said he was forwarded emails about the corruption allegations, which he then sent on to the IAAF ethics committee, leaving it to investigate. His director of communications, Jackie Brock-Doyle, added: \\"He did not feel it was necessary to read the attachments. \\"You may think this shows a lack of curiosity. He, and we, would argue that it shows a full duty of care, ensuring the right people in the right place were aware of allegations and were investigating them.\\" Diack Jr claims that he and Coe met during the IAAF presidential campaign, twice in Beijing and once in the Bahamas. This was almost a year after Coe was sent the email about allegations against Diack Jr and several months after it was revealed the Senegalese had been accused of corruption on a grand scale. The claims of Diack Jr, who has been banned for life by the IAAF, have to be treated with extreme caution, but there is evidence - in the form of emails and text messages between Diack Jr, Coe and Nick Davies, the IAAF's head of communications - that he did indeed help Coe during his presidential bid. At the time, Davies was helping Coe's election campaign. The following are some of text messages, seen by Panorama, which call into question how Coe ran his successful IAAF presidency election campaign. These messages are from 2015 - several months after the world knew Diack Jr had been accused of dishonesty on a grand scale. Coe also appeared keen to ensure Diack Jr made an important meeting. Diack Jr told the BBC that the \\"friend\\" mentioned in this message was Hamad Kalkaba Malboum, president of the Confederation of African Athletics, whose support was crucial. In the days before the election, Diack Jr appeared to provide information on the election tactics of Coe's rival, Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian former Olympic pole vault champion. Diack Jr also seemed to provide intelligence on how IAAF delegates might vote in the presidential election, asking Davies to get a message to Coe to speak to Phil Knight of Nike for confirmation from the USA delegate Steve Miller. This next message refers to the 24 out of 30 nations Diack Jr claims he could talk to and get support for Coe. The Briton won the election by a margin of 23 votes, 115-92. The BBC showed these text messages to Jack Robertson, a former chief investigator for the World Anti-Doping Agency and the man who investigated the Shobukhova doping scandal. \\"It appears that Coe is taking advice from someone who is at the centre of this scandal to extort athletes,\\" said Robertson. \\"It's wrong on so many fronts. It's not just disappointing, it's disgusting.\\" In an interview with Panorama, Diack Jr said Lord Coe would not have become IAAF president without his help. \\"If he had not the blessing of Lamine Diack or my support, he would have never been elected as the IAAF president,\\" he said. \\"He knows that.\\" Coe refused the BBC's request for an interview to discuss his relationship with Diack Jr and said the suggestion he sought the Senegalese's support was wrong. The Briton's spokeswoman added: \\"As with any campaign, lots of people offer advice - wanted or not, some helpful, some not. You try to be civil but wary. \\"This was the case with Mr Diack. He sent messages of support whilst at the same time supporting other candidates and accusing Seb Coe of leading a British media campaign against both him and his father.\\" Diack Jr is currently living in Senegal and Interpol has issued a notice for his arrest over allegations of bribery and corruption, which he rejects. \\"I have never, never, never been involved in any payment or any extortion of Lilia Shobukhova,\\" he said. \\"All we did about this Russian affair was to protect our World Championships. There was no cover-up of any, any, any doping matters.\\" Last week, the IAAF's ethics board announced that Davies was one of three IAAF members being provisionally suspended over allegations they took money to delay naming Russian drugs cheats. Given he is now the subject of an IAAF investigation, Davies said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the Panorama programme. But Robertson is happy to speak out and said: \\"I hate to use the word, but he [Coe] got in bed with the devil to win the election. \\"I don't mean to call Papa Diack the devil, but he was certainly in the middle of the investigation. \\"And if he [Coe] makes a decision such as that, how can we trust him with other decisions? My bottom line is clean athletes deserve better.\\" The Panorama programme airs on the eve of an IAAF meeting in Vienna to decide whether to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Rio Olympics.","output":"Text messages shown to the BBC suggest Papa Massata Diack, a former consultant to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and now wanted by Interpol, secured votes for the election of Lord Coe in August.

In the first quarter, the Raiders grabbed the early lead, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Sebastian Janikowski. The Broncos responded, with quarterback Tim Tebow hooking up with wide receiver Eric Decker on a 27-yard touchdown pass. The Raiders re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with quarterback Carson Palmer throwing two touchdown passes: an 11-yarder to running back Michael Bush, followed by a 40-yarder to fullback Marcel Reece. In the third quarter, the Broncos cut into the Raiders' lead, with a 26-yard touchdown pass from Tebow to wide receiver Eddie Royal. The Raiders responded, with Palmer throwing an 18-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jacoby Ford, giving Oakland a 24-14 lead. However, the Broncos would dominate the remainder of the game, beginning with a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, followed by running back Willis McGahee rushing for a 60-yard touchdown at the end of the third quarter. The Broncos grabbed the lead with six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, when Royal returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown, then pulled away with a 24-yard touchdown run by McGahee.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half.  - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - Diocletian, born Diocles (244312), was a Roman emperor from 284 to 305. Born to a family of low status in the Roman province of Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become cavalry commander to the Emperor Carus. After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him in the Battle of the Margus. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. He appointed fellow officer Maximian as Augustus, co-emperor, in 286.  - Valens ( 328 -- 9 August 378 ) , fully Flavius Julius Valens Augustus ( Latin : FLAVIVS IVLIVS VALENS AVGVSTVS ) , was Eastern Roman Emperor from 364 to 378 . He was given the eastern half of the empire by his brother Valentinian I after the latter 's accession to the throne . Valens , sometimes known as the Last True Roman , was defeated and killed in the Battle of Adrianople , which marked the beginning of the collapse of the decaying Western Roman Empire .  - Valentinian I (3 July 321  17 November 375), also known as Valentinian the Great, was Roman emperor from 364 to 375. Upon becoming emperor he made his brother Valens his co-emperor, giving him rule of the eastern provinces while Valentinian retained the west.  - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".  - Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.  - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\".  - Edirne, historically known as \\"Adrianople\\", in Bulgarian known as \\"Odrin\\", is a city in the northwestern Turkish province of Edirne, in the region of East Thrace, close to Turkey's borders with Greece and Bulgaria. Edirne served as the third capital city of the Ottoman Empire from 1363 to 1453, before Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) became the empire's fourth and final capital. At present, Edirne is the capital of Edirne Province in Turkish Thrace. The city's estimated population in 2014 was 165,979.  - The Goths were an East Germanic people, two of whose branches, the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths, played an important role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the emergence of Medieval Europe. The Goths dominated a vast area, which at its peak under the Germanic king Ermanaric and his sub-king Athanaric possibly extended all the way from the Danube to the Don, and from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea.  - Historiography is the study of the methodology of historians in developing history as an academic discipline, and by extension is any body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches. Scholars discuss historiography by topic  such as the \\"Historiography of the United Kingdom\\", the \\"Historiography of Canada\\", \\"Historiography of the British Empire\\", the \\"historiography of early Islam\\", the \\"historiography of China\\"  and different approaches and genres, such as political history and social history. Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the ascent of academic history, there developed a body of historiographic literature. The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties  such as to their nation state  is a debated question.  - The Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378), sometimes known as the Battle of Hadrianopolis, was fought between an Eastern Roman army led by the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens and Gothic rebels (largely Thervings as well as Greutungs, non-Gothic Alans, and various local rebels) led by Fritigern. The battle took place about north of Adrianople (modern Edirne in European Turkey, near the border with Greece and Bulgaria) in the Roman province of Thracia.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Mitt Romney isn’t going to shake up his staff. Should he? Talk of a shakeup in Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign is running rampant, with the expectation within the Republican political class that the former Massachusetts governor will add seasoned hands rather than part ways with any of his current senior staffers. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney finishes speaking about the Supreme Court ruling on health care in Washington, Thursday, June 28, 2012. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) At the heart of the critique of the Romney campaign, which began with a tweet from News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch and has continued with a stinging Wall Street Journal op-ed and harsh words for the campaign from the Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol today, is the idea that the presidential candidate’s staff may not be up to the task of running the sort of race it will take to beat President Obama. “The campaign needs to show the GOP elite world and the media a lot of competence going forward or this shake-up talk will only get louder and continue,” predicted one Republican adviser watching from the sidelines. In conversations with a handful of senior Republican operatives — none of whom are formally affiliated with the campaign and all of whom spoke under the condition their names not be used in order to allow them to speak candidly — opinions differed on whether some staff change might be a good thing. The one thing the whole group agreed on is that Romney is likely to add people before he subtracts anyone at a senior level. “The talent in senior staff is mostly one of their assets, not one of their problems,” said one longtime Republican consultant. “Nobody will lose their job,” added another. “They will probably add a couple of high visibility strategists/operatives relatively soon, if only to keep the critics at bay.” The loyalty and long service of Romney’s inner circle has always — or at least to this point — been seen as a strength not a weakness for the candidate. Matt Rhoades, the campaign manager, served as communications director during Romney’s 2008 campaign and then ran the candidate’s political action committee in the interregnum between races. Beth Myers, who is overseeing the vice presidential search, managed Romney’s 2008 campaign and was a part of the Romney Administration in Massachusetts. Ditto Eric Fehrnstrom who has long been considered Romney’s alter-ego. “Matt Rhoades has kept that thing humming with only the minimal amount of drama,” said one Republican consultant. “[Communications Director] Gail Gitcho has been a fantastic off-the-record fighter.” And, in truth, the critique that a candidate’s inner circle is too insular and not able to see the big picture is as old as politics itself. President Obama had to beat back stories during the 2008 campaign that his political inner circle was too small and not big-picture enough. And, even though he won a sweeping victory in 2008, that narrative has resurfaced already in his 2012 re-election campaign. Viewed through that lens, the chatter about a staff shakeup is nothing new. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter or that some of the criticism doesn’t have merit. The largest strain of unhappiness voiced by the strategist class is that the communications side of the campaign isn’t functioning at the highest level — from a slow response to the Post’s story about Romney’s outsourcing/offshoring at Bain to Fehnrstrom’s comments to NBC’s Chuck Todd on Monday regarding the penalty/tax debate on the individual mandate. “I do think they have a problem on the communications end...they’re not sharp, they’re not creative and I think they’re trying too hard to tear down Obama and not hard enough to build Romney up,” said one Republican strategist. The likeliest outcome of this staff foofaraw, according to those familiar with the goings-on in the Romney campaign, is that a few seasoned hands with national campaign experience will be added to the operation. In the waning days of Romney’s primary victory, the campaign hired on Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, and Brian Jones, a former communications director at the RNC. They have not made any other staff additions since then. “The Romney campaign should have expanded their senior team months ago, once the nomination was in sight,” said one high-level Republican consultant. “They need much more than that, especially on the strategy side.

This could take a few minutes depending on your age.. + Stretch to your toes, moving your right heel up as far as you can in that position. Feel the stretch in your neck, upper arms, and lower back.. Answer:","output":"Then, lift your left arm over your head and gently place your hand on the right side of your head. Slowly bend your head towards the_left_side and hold this position for about 10-15 counts. While holding this position, take deep breaths and focus on releasing the tension in your neck muscles. Be mindful not to pull too hard on your head, as the goal is to create a gentle stretch, not to strain the neck muscles. Once you have held the stretch for 10-15 counts, slowly release your left hand and bring your head back to the neutral position. Repeat this stretch on the opposite side by placing your left hand under your left thigh or holding the left side of the seat of your chair. Raise your right arm over your head and place your hand on the left side of your head, slowly bending your head towards the_right_side. Hold for 10-15 counts, remembering to maintain deep, even breaths throughout the stretch. Additionally, perform the stretch for each vertebra from your neck to your right shoulder. Begin by dropping your head forward gently to focus on the top of the neck, holding this stretch for two breaths. Slowly roll your head down and to the right, focusing on each vertebra as you make your way towards your right shoulder. This will help you release tension throughout the entire neck area, ensuring that you're targeting all the muscles that may be holding stress. Once you've completed these stretches, try incorporating some movements focused on the rest of your body to further alleviate stress. Starting at the top of your head, gently roll your head in circles, feeling the stretch move throughout your neck and upper shoulders. Then, standing up straight, reach your arms up overhead, stretching your fingertips towards the sky. Slowly bend to the left and then to the right, creating a stretch on both sides of your torso. Finally, stretch down to your toes by bending at the waist, keeping your knees slightly bent. Grasp your right heel with both hands, drawing your chest towards your knee. Feel the stretch in your neck, upper arms, and lower back as you hold this position for a few breaths. Switch to the left side, holding your left heel and drawing your chest towards your left knee, holding for a few breaths. By incorporating these varied stretches into your daily routine, you will not only help to relieve stress in your neck and other areas of your body, but you will also promote better posture, increased flexibility, and improved overall well-being. Always remember to listen to your body and adjust the intensity of your stretches to suit your individual needs, ensuring a safe and effective stretching experience."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What did Russ lie about? airing the tape A:","output":"Title: The Unseen Footage Step 1: Introduce the Main Characters The story revolves around Russ, an aspiring filmmaker, and his close group of friends - Hannah, a young woman with big dreams and aspirations, Scott, an aspiring actor, and Claire, a talented scriptwriter. Step 2: Establish the Setting The movie is set in a bustling city, a perfect place for aspiring artists and filmmakers. The characters are all in their late twenties, struggling to make a name for themselves in the competitive world of filmmaking and entertainment. Step 3: Introduce the Conflict One day, while cleaning up his video storage, Russ stumbles upon a mysterious tape that he's sure he never recorded. Eager to discover its contents, he decides to watch the tape alone. The footage shocks him - it shows a terrible incident involving his friends from a past party that could potentially ruin their careers if ever released. Step 4: Russ' Lie Disturbed by the footage and fearing its potential consequences, Russ decides to lie to his friends about watching the tape. He casually brings up the topic of the tape during a group dinner and states that it's just an old, harmless project they did together. The friends feel relieved, believing Russ when he says there's nothing to worry about. Step 5: Secrets Unfold and Tensions Rise As time passes, pieces of information about the incident caught on tape start to surface among their circle of friends. This stirs suspicion within the group, and they gradually begin to question Russ's version of the events. The trust and bond that once held them together start to crumble as suspicions rise and relationships become strained. Step 6: Resolution and Climax Faced with mounting pressure and fearing exposure, Russ finally comes clean about his lie to his friends. They are understandably hurt and angry, but the confession presents them with a chance to collectively confront their past mistakes. Together, they decide to destroy the tape and agree to never speak of the incident again. Step 7: Character Growth and Conclusion Although the friends have to face the consequences of their actions, their experience also leads to personal growth and self-improvement. Russ learns the value of honesty and the cost of lying to protect the ones he loves. Likewise, his friends learn to take responsibility for their actions and appreciate the importance of trust in their relationships. In the end, Russ and his friends continue to chase their dreams and aspirations, but they move forward with valuable lessons learned and a stronger bond between them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Statement 2: Where do we use 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1024 KB, 1 GB = 1024 MB, 1 TB = 1024 GB? As well as an additional query: \\"Is the phone OK if it has 1 GB ram?\\" Step 2: Analyze the statements. Statement 1 describes the decimal system of measuring storage capacity, and it is primarily used by the International System of Units (SI) for base-10 prefixes, which include kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G), and tera (T). Statement 2 describes the binary system of measuring storage capacity, and it is used in the context of computer systems, where memory and storage capacities are calculated using base-2 (binary) numbers. In this context, the base-2 prefixes include kibi (Ki), mebi (Mi), gibi (Gi), and tebi (Ti). Step 3: Compare the statements. The two statements describe different measurement systems (decimal and binary) used in different contexts. Therefore, they do not have the same meaning. Step 4: Evaluate the additional query. Answer options: [a]. no. [b]. yes. The query \\"Is the phone OK if it has 1 GB ram?\\" does not directly relate to the similarities or differences between the two measurement systems mentioned in the statements. Therefore, the options provided do not properly address this query. However, to answer this query, it depends on the user's requirements and the specific tasks that the phone needs to handle. For basic use, 1 GB of RAM would be considered sufficient, but for more advanced activities such as gaming or multitasking, additional RAM might be necessary. Step 5: Select the appropriate answer. Since the two statements do not have the same meaning based on the analysis in Steps 1-3, the correct answer should be: [a]. no."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Movie title: Above Suspicion Movie plot: Oxford, England, 1939 on the eve of the United States entering World War 2, the Germans have a new secret weapon, a magnetic water bomb that is pulled to a ship and explodes. The British want to know more about how it works and pull in American scholar Richard Myles (Fred MacMurray) to obtain information undercover in the Father land. Richard has just married classmate Frances (Joan Crawford) and the two take off for a private honeymoon on the coast. Before they know it they have agreed to be spies and take off to Germany, Frances with a rose in her hat to signal their presence to an unknown contact who will give them further information on who the main contacts in the country will have information about the destructive weapons of Germany. When they have landed they are contacted by suspicious Hassert Seidel (Conrad Veidt) who leads them to a hotel where another contact gives them more information about a concert with information located in the musical notes, which have been secluded in a tourist guide book. Richard makes friends with fellow Oxford scholar Thornley (Bruce Lester) and the three Americans are thrown together when someone shoots a high-ranking official at a Franz Liszt concert stopping the proceedings for questioning from the Nazis. At the concert disruptions Richard meets another Oxford chum, Sig von Aschenhausen (Basil Rathbone) whose place in Germany is unknown to the Americans until they realize that he is a Nazi himself, and aware of a contingency to gather information back to Britain. Aschenhausen is the perfectly sever German and he kidnaps Frances and tortures her to get information, thus putting Richard, Thornley, and Seidel into action to try to free her, and get back to the land of the free. Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Above Suspicion,\\" American scholar Richard Myles, played by Fred MacMurray, is sent to obtain information undercover in the Father land, which is a term often used to refer to Germany. The film is set in 1939, on the eve of the United States entering World War 2. The British, who are interested in learning more about a new magnetic water bomb being developed by the Germans, approach Richard for this covert mission.  Richard, who has recently married his classmate Frances, played by Joan Crawford, is not yet aware of the spy life that awaits him. Their covert mission commences when the newlyweds head to Germany for what was supposed to be a private honeymoon on the coast. Frances uses a rose in her hat as a signal to their unknown contact in Germany. This contact is set to provide them with more information on other contacts within the country who may have valuable information about the German's destructive weaponry. Upon their arrival, they are approached by the suspicious Hassert Seidel, played by Conrad Veidt, who directs them to a hotel where another source provides more information. This new information involves the musical notes of a concert, hidden within a tourist guide book, and is revealed to be crucial in their main mission. In the course of their mission, Richard encounters an old Oxford friend, Thornley, played by Bruce Lester. Their paths cross when a high-ranking official is shot during a Franz Liszt concert, leading to questioning by the Nazis. Another Oxford chum, Sig von Aschenhausen, portrayed by Basil Rathbone, also makes an appearance at this point. However, his role in Germany is at first unknown to Richard and Thornley. Their situation gets more complicated when it becomes apparent that Aschenhausen is a Nazi who is aware of the contingency to gather information back to Britain. Taking his role as a severe German to the extreme, Aschenhausen kidnaps Frances and tortures her for information. This act thrusts Richard, Thornley, and Seidel into action as they maneuver to rescue Frances and return to their homeland.  So, in summary, the character sent to obtain information undercover in the Fatherland is Richard Myles, who takes on this clandestine role amidst a whirlwind honeymoon and a series of dangerous encounters. It's an equally intellectual and adrenaline-rushing story, providing a mix of suspense, treacherous twists, and war-time intrigue. Whether its investment value holds, that would depend on the merit you place on these genre elements and the historical context that this plot offers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After six hours of questioning the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife.

Answer the following question: This article: Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director.

Kicker Phil Dawson (4) slaps hands with Garrett Celek (88) after making a 50-yard field goal in the 2nd quarter of a preseason game between the 49ers and the Houston Texans at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, 49ers’ preseason takeaway: What a difference in Davis Mike Davis had no nowhere to go but up after his rookie season, but who expected the 49ers running back to reach such heights Sunday? Yes, it was a preseason game, but the slimmed-down, cutting-on-a-dime Davis looked far shiftier than the first-year version. In 2015, Davis (35 carries, 58 yards) became the sixth running back since 1970 to average less than 2.0 yards a carry with at least 35 attempts in a season (the anonymous others: Louis Carter, Reggie Rivers, Lamar Gordon, Odell Lawson and Willie Spencer). On Sunday, in a 24-13 loss to the Texans, Davis rushed for 71 yards on five carries, ripping off gains of 44 and 17 yards. Chip Kelly was asked if Davis, a fourth-round pick, looked different than the player he’d seen on video in 2015. Kelly began with a joke (“Yeah, he’s a lot bigger in person”), before acknowledging Davis boosted his chances of making the 53-man roster. “I knew that he ran behind his pads really well and he’s shown that,” Kelly said. “He’s really put himself in a position for a spot … Some guys really stepped up and really took advantage of that opportunity and some other guys were kind of looking around and kind of caught up in the moment.” Davis stepped up because he stepped with more burst than he showed in 2015. Davis, listed at 5-foot-9, 217 pounds, isn’t a burner (4.58-second 40), but on Sunday he wasn’t the plodder he resembled as a rookie. 2-8-SF43 (shotgun): Davis right guard pushed ob at HST 13 for 44 yards. Davis, lined up to the right of QB Thad Lewis, began with a counter move that put him in the middle of the backfield. He then bounced back to the right and ran through a sizable hole created by a seal block from TE Blake Bell and pancake block from RT Trent Brown. Five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, Davis hopped over the would-be shoestring tackles of two defenders and raced down the right sideline. 2-10-HOU 13 (shotgun): Davis left tackle to HST 6 for 7 yards Davis, lined up the right of Lewis, ran left as he took the handoff and drifted parallel to the line of scrimmage, before cutting hard off his left foot and running decisively downfield. 2-10-HOU 46 (shotgun): Davis right end to HST 43 for 3 yards David, lined up to the right of Lewis, drifted left before cutting hard right. It initially appeared the cutback would net a decent gain, but Lewis got in his way as he carried out a zone-read fake. Lewis appeared to offer a Davis a my-bad tap on the helmet after the play. 2-5-SF 25 (shotgun): M.Davis left tackle to SF 42 for 17 yards Davis, lined up to the left of Lewis, drifted to the middle of the backfield before cutting hard off his right foot. He avoided a would-be tackler at his feet in the backfield and sprinted into the open field. Said play-by-play man Bob Fitzgerald after the run: “Did Mike Davis just get faster in the offseason?” 2-10-SF 42 (shotgun): Davis right end to SF 43 for 1 yard Davis, lined up the right of Lewis, cut right and probably would have gained about five yards if he squared his shoulders and ran upfield. Instead, he tried to juke a defender, bounced outside and ran four yards in the wrong direction before he was dragged down by a host of defenders. He’s faster than he was last year, but he’s not fast enough to turn the corner on a run like that.

Spanning over three centuries, this empire left an indelible mark on Indian history and culture with its diverse range of art forms. This article explores the various art treasures of the Mughal Empire that not only epitomize its cultural richness, but also reflect the imperial patronage and refined taste of its rulers. I. Mughal Miniature Paintings: Mughal miniature paintings evolved from the blending of Persian, Indian, and Central Asian styles and were popularized during the reign of Emperor Akbar. They are considered some of the most remarkable achievements in the history of Indian painting. These intricate paintings were usually commissioned to illustrate poetic and historical manuscripts or as independent paintings. Famous for their attention to detail, balance of colors, and sophisticated compositions, Mughal miniatures are rich in symbolism and illuminated with gold and silver. Noteworthy examples include those showcasing the tales of the Persian epic Shahnama, the life and conquests of Emperor Akbar, and the ethereal depictions of Emperor Jahangir and his court. Among the prominent painters were Abdu's Samad, Basawan, Bishndas, and Ustad Mansur, who immortalized Mughal emperors, nobility, and landscapes with their brushes. II. Mughal Architecture: Mughal architecture is characterized by its distinctive fusion of Persian, Indian, and Islamic styles, replete with domes, arches, and ornamental designs. The architectural marvels exhibit the grandeur and opulence of the Mughal era, with exemplary craftsmanship and engineering. Some iconic Mughal monuments include the Taj Mahal, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort. 1. Taj Mahal: An epitome of love, the Taj Mahal was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is constructed primarily of white marble and is adorned with intricate inlay work using precious stones. It stands as a testament to the expertise of Mughal artisans and architects. 2. Humayun's Tomb: Humayun's Tomb, another UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built by his widow, Bega Begum, in 1570. The tomb served as a prototype for Mughal mausoleum architecture, showcasing a synthesis of Persian and Indian styles with its octagonal layout, high arches, and a central dome. 3. Red Fort: Completed in 1648, the Red Fort is a massive fortification in Delhi that served as the main residence for Mughal emperors. It is an outstanding example of Mughal architectural splendor, characterized by its red sandstone walls, grand halls, and intricate lattice screens. III. Decorative and Applied Arts: Mughal decorative and applied arts are renowned for their intricate craftsmanship, luxurious materials, and high aesthetic appeal. Some notable forms include metalwork, textiles, carpets, manuscripts, and jewelry. These art forms were patronized by the Mughal emperors, who sought to surround themselves with beauty and luxury. 1. Metalwork: Mughal metalwork includes remarkable examples of vessels, weapons, and ornaments made from gold, silver, and copper alloys. The metalwork is often embellished with enameling, inlay work, and gemstones. 2. Textiles: The Mughal Empire produced some of the finest textiles in the Indian subcontinent, including the famed kani shawls and brocade work. Textiles were adorned with intricate patterns and motifs, curated from Persian, Chinese, and Indian sources. 3. Carpets: Mughal carpets were reputed for their high-quality craftsmanship and the intricate weaving techniques that gave them an opulent appearance. Carpets during Mughal rule typically featured geometric or floral patterns and were made with the finest silk, wool, and even metal-thread. 4. Manuscripts: The making and illustration of Persian and Indian manuscripts saw a golden age under Mughal rule. Calligraphers, painters, and bookbinders came together to create exquisite volumes showcasing the finest craftsmanship and artistic ingenuity. 5. Jewelry: Mughal jewelry was renowned for its intricate designs, lavish use of gemstones, and high-quality goldsmith work. This led to the creation of iconic pieces such as the Peacock Throne, the Timur Ruby, and the Shah Jahan Emerald. Conclusion: The Mughal Empire's art treasures are an ode to the rich history and cultural diversity of India. These profound artistic accomplishments display a keen eye for beauty and expertise in various mediums, blending native and foreign techniques to create a distinctive style. Today, they continue to enthrall us and stand as a testament to the mastery of Mughal artists and craftsmen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

From this gas and dust, everything we now see was made. How were stars and planets created from just gas and dust? The answer is gravity. The same gravity that holds you down on Earth. The same force that causes your pencil to roll off your desk. The same force that causes it to fall to the floor. The invisible force of gravity caused dust and gas particles to be pulled together. This force is what formed all the objects in our solar system. This force formed the smallest moons. It also formed our Sun. This force caused more than just our solar system to form.

Article: In this April 13, 2018 photo hobby archaeologist Rene Schoen and 13-year-old Luca Malaschnitschenko, right, search for coins after a medieval silver treasure had been found near Schaprode on the northern... (Associated Press)      BERLIN (AP) — Hundreds of 1,000-year-old silver coins, rings, pearls and bracelets linked to the era of Danish King Harald Gormsson have been found on the eastern German island of Ruegen in the Baltic Sea.      A single silver coin was first found in January by two amateur archaeologists, one of them a 13-year-old boy, in a field near the village of Schaprode. The state archaeology office then became involved and the entire treasure was uncovered by experts over the weekend, the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania state archaeology office said Monday.      \\"It's the biggest trove of such coins in the southeastern Baltic region,\\" the statement said.      The office said the two amateur archeologists were asked to keep quiet about their discovery to give professionals time to plan the dig and were then invited to participate in the recovery.      \\"This was the (biggest) discovery of my life,\\" hobby archaeologist Rene Schoen told the German news agency dpa.      Schoen said he and 13-year-old Luca Malaschnitschenko were using metal detectors on the field near Schaprode when Luca found a little piece that he initially thought was only aluminum garbage. But when they cleaned it, they understood it was more precious.      Archaeologists said about 100 of the silver coins are probably from the reign of Harald Gormsson, better known as \\"Harald Bluetooth,\\" who lived in the 10th century and introduced Christianity to Denmark.      He was one of the last Viking kings of what is now Denmark, northern Germany, southern Sweden and parts of Norway.      His nickname came from the fact he had a dead tooth that looked bluish, but it's now best known for the wireless Bluetooth technology invented by Swedish telecom company Ericsson. The company named the technology, developed to wirelessly unite computers with cellular devices, after him for his ability to unite ancient Scandinavia.      The technology logo carries the runic letters for his initials HB.      ___      Jan M. Olsen contributed from Copenhagen, Denmark. ||||| Discovery by a 13-year-old and an amateur archaeologist leads to hoard linked to king who brought Christianity to Denmark      A 13-year-old boy and an amateur archaeologist have unearthed a “significant” trove in Germany which may have belonged to the Danish king Harald Bluetooth who brought Christianity to Denmark.      René Schön and his student Luca Malaschnitschenko were looking for treasure using metal detectors in January on northern Rügen island when they chanced upon what they initially thought was a worthless piece of aluminium.      But upon closer inspection, they realised that it was a piece of silver, German media reported.      Over the weekend, the regional archaeology service began a dig covering 400 sq metres (4,300 sq ft). It has found a hoard believed to be linked to the Danish king Harald Gormsson, better known as “Harry Bluetooth”, who reigned from around AD958 to 986.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Archaeologists working on the dig on Rügen island after the find by René Schön and Luca Malaschnitschenko. Photograph: Stefan Sauer/AFP/Getty Images      Braided necklaces, pearls, brooches, a Thor’s hammer, rings and up to 600 chipped coins were found, including more than 100 that date back to Bluetooth’s era, when he ruled over what is now Denmark, northern Germany, southern Sweden and parts of Norway.      “This trove is the biggest single discovery of Bluetooth coins in the southern Baltic Sea region and is therefore of great significance,” the lead archaeologist, Michael Schirren, told national news agency DPA.      The oldest coin is a Damascus dirham dating to 714 while the most recent is a penny dating to 983.      The find suggests that the treasure may have been buried in the late 980s – also the period when Bluetooth was known to have fled to Pomerania, where he died in 987.      “We have here the rare case of a discovery that appears to corroborate historical sources,” said the archaeologist Detlef Jantzen.      Bluetooth is credited with unifying Denmark. The Viking-born king also turned his back on old Norse religion and introduced Christianity to the Nordic country.      But he was forced to flee to Pomerania after a rebellion led by his son Sven Gabelbart.      Bluetooth’s lasting legacy is found today in smartphones and laptops – the wireless Bluetooth technology is named after him, and the symbol is composed of the two runes spelling out his initials HB. ||||| At the weekend archaeologists from the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania excavated an area of about 400 square metres in an open field near the Rügen village of Schaprode.      To their surprise, they discovered Viking Age necklaces, rings, bracelets, beads, brooches, and 500 to 600 partially split coins - 100 of which are from a period in the late tenth century during King Harald's rule.      \\"This is the largest single find of Bluetooth coins in the southern Baltic Sea region and is therefore of outstanding importance,\\" excavation director Michael Schirren said.      With a weight of 0.3 grams, the silver coins bearing a Christian cross were among Denmark’s first independent coins.      Photo: DPA      Similar types of coins have so far only been found in the territory of the Danish empire, such as at Husby and Harndrup, according to the excavation director.      Harald Bluetooth is regarded as the founder of the Danish empire in that he brought the previously fragmented country together, implemented reforms and introduced Christianity to Denmark.      In 1872 and 1874, only a few kilometres away on the island of Hiddensee, gold jewellery also attributed to the king was discovered. It’s possible there is a connection between this find and the one at the weekend, according to Schirren.      In January, hobby archaeologist René Schön and pupil Luca Malaschnitschenko had been searching for treasures with a metal detector on Rügen.      Little did they know that the piece of aluminium they found would prompt a team of archaeologists to search the area and uncover more treasures from the late tenth century.      \\"That was the find of my life,\\" Schön said.

Shortly after 1:30 pm on June 13, 2008, Russert collapsed at the offices of WRC-TV, which houses the Washington, D.C. bureau of NBC News where he was chief. He was recording voiceovers for the Sunday edition of Meet the Press. In a speech he gave at the Kennedy Center, Brian Williams said that Russert's last words were, \\"What's happening?\\" spoken as a greeting to NBC Washington bureau editing supervisor Candace Harrington as he passed her in the hallway. He then walked down the hallway to record voiceovers in the soundproof booth and collapsed. A co-worker began to perform CPR on him. The District of Columbia Fire and Rescue service received a call from NBC at 1:40 pm, and dispatched an EMS unit which arrived at 1:44 pm. Paramedics attempted to defibrillate Russert's heart three times, but he did not respond. Russert was then transported to Sibley Memorial Hospital, arriving at 2:23 pm, where he was pronounced dead. He was 58 years old.  In accordance with American journalistic tradition, the public announcement of Russert's death was withheld by the wire services and his network's competitors, until Russert's family had been notified. Retired NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw then delivered, live on NBC, CNBC, and MSNBC, the news of his death. NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams was on assignment in Afghanistan and could not anchor the special report. CBS and ABC also interrupted programming to report Russert's death. Armen Keteyian reported the news for CBS and Charles Gibson reported for ABC. Russert had just returned from a family vacation in Rome, Italy, where he had celebrated his son's graduation from Boston College. While his wife and son remained in Rome, Russert had returned to prepare for his Sunday television show.  Russert's longtime friend and physician, Dr. Michael Newman, said that his asymptomatic coronary artery disease had been controlled with medication (LDL-C was <70 mg/dL) and exercise, and that he had performed well on a stress test in late April. An autopsy performed on the day of his death determined that his history of coronary artery disease led to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and ventricular fibrillation with the immediate cause being an occlusive coronary thrombosis in the left anterior descending artery resulting from a ruptured cholesterol plaque.  Russert is buried at Rock Creek Cemetery. The Newseum in Washington, D.C., exhibited a re-creation of Russert's office with original elements such as his desks, bookshelves, folders, loose leaf papers and notebooks. In August 2014, the exhibit was disassembled at the Newseum and transported to the Buffalo History Museum.

Wearing an oversized red cap to protect him from the scorching Philippine sun, Dante is doing work that should be reserved for men, not children.  Earning 150 pesos (3.50) for a seven-hour day, Dante has been a child laborer in the Philippine region of Mindanao since he was seven years old. He says he does it to help his parents, but he is just one of many children who are part of an illegal economic system of child labor.  The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates 2.4 million child workers are in the Philippines. Many of them, according to the ILO, are in rural areas working in fields and mines. The organization estimates 60% work in hazardous conditions.  Alongside Dante is 13-year-old Alvic James, who dropped out of school when he was in the first grade. Back then, he explained, his family didn't have enough money to eat. Alvic says he wants to learn to read and write but because he is needed in the fields he has no time to go to school.  When the boys turn 15 or 16, they'll move on to the more hazardous job of cutting sugar cane. That's currently the job of 16-year-old Elmar Paran, who hasn't been to school since he was a young child, sentencing him to a future in the fields.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A man throws a net off of a boat while children watch.\\" if \\"the man is fishing\\"?","output":"It is possible to conclude that \\"A man throws a net off of a boat while children watch\\" if \\"the man is fishing,\\" but one must consider several factors and make certain assumptions to reach this conclusion.  First, we must define \\"fishing.\\" Fishing is the activity of catching fish, either for food, recreation, or sport. This activity can be done in various environments, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. It can also be carried out with different tools and techniques, such as with a line and hook, nets, or even with bare hands. Now, given that the man is fishing, we can assume that he is engaged in the activity of catching fish. However, since there are various techniques for fishing, concluding that the man is throwing a net requires the assumption that the man is using a net for fishing. Throwing a net is common in certain types of fishing, like cast net fishing, purse seine fishing, or other types of commercial or traditional fishing. Consequently, it is plausible but not guaranteed that he may be using a net for fishing. There is also the mention of the boat in the original statement. Since the man is fishing, it can be inferred that he is on a body of water. Boats are a typical mode of transportation used for fishing activities and allow access to deeper waters or places unreachable from the shore. So, the premise of the man fishing off of a boat is reasonable.  Lastly, we must address the presence of children watching. It is not unusual for children to be around during various activities, including fishing. They might be observing the process, learning from adults, or simply enjoying the experience. However, their presence is not inherently connected to the act of fishing. Assuming that the children are at a location where they can observe the man fishing (e.g., on the boat or nearby), it is plausible that children could be present while the man is fishing. To conclude that \\"A man throws a net off of a boat while children watch\\" if \\"the man is fishing,\\" one would have to assume that: 1. The man is using a net as his fishing method. 2. The man is fishing from a boat. 3. Children are present and able to observe the man fishing. If these assumptions are accepted, it is possible to conclude that the sentence \\"A man throws a net off of a boat while children watch\\" can hold true if \\"the man is fishing.\\" Nevertheless, it is important to note that these are assumptions made to connect the two statements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who does the person that the drifter warns want him to kill? ?  Michael Williams is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash—\\"half now, half later\\"—and Michael plays along by taking the money. Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas. Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead. Michael and Suzanne escape onto a nearby train, but when Suzanne tries to betray Michael, he throws the money out of the speeding train and then throws Suzanne off to be arrested by the police accompanied by a wounded Wayne. Michael's train continues its journey into a new town.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was taught how to play guitar by Roger Cremer?  Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \\"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\\".When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \\"Lucky You\\". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modelled for...

They wanted everyone, including little kids like you, to understand why it's better to find other ways to make things work. You know that cars, buses, and factories use oil to run, right? Well, the more we depend on oil, the more it can cause problems. The friendly group wants us to know about three main dangers of using too much oil. 1. Dirty Air: When we burn oil to make machines go, it can cause dirty smoke to go into the air. This makes the air harder to breathe and it's not good for our lungs or our friends like the birds and squirrels. 2. Harm to Mother Earth: Oil can sometimes spill into the water or on land, making homes of fish, plants, and other animals dirty. It's like when you spill juice on the floor, but much harder to clean up. 3. Running Out of Oil: If we keep using a lot of oil, one day there may not be enough left for everyone. It's like when you eat all the cookies in the jar. Once they're gone, there are no more cookies! The nice group wants us to remember that we can use other things instead of oil, like wind that can move a pinwheel, or sun that can make your skin feel warm.

His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing.

Summarize this article: Before wrapping in the opposite direction, press down on the yarn between the pegs with the side of the hand. This moves the loops down on the pegs and creates room to loop the yarn around each of the pegs again. There should be some resistance when pressing down on the yarn. This  indicates good tension, which will result in a neat looking finished scarf. If the yarn feels loose or has already slid to the peg bottom on its own, then the pegs are not wrapped tightly enough. In this case, you may need to start over. Each peg (except for the last peg wrapped) will need to have two loops on it before working the loops off the loom. To make a second pass, bring the yarn down from the last peg wrapped and around it in the same direction as the yarn from the previous pass. Bring the yarn up to the next peg moving back towards the beginning of the loom. Keep wrapping the yarn around the pegs in the same direction as first round of loops until the last peg (the first peg wrapped on the first pass). Wrap this peg from the opposite direction. After wrapping the last peg, hold the yarn in place with fingers or wrap it around the anchor peg on this side of the loom. When each peg in the row is wrapped twice (except for last peg on upper end of the loom) begin working the bottom row of loops off the loom. Insert loom tool through the bottom loop on the last peg in lower row. Bring the loop up and over the other loop on the peg to knit it.  After knitting the first loop on the lower row, repeat for the bottom loop on the upper row. Return to the lower row going back and forth to knit the loops until the end of the row. When finished working the first round of loops off the loom, only one stitch is on each of the pegs. Continue the process of wrapping the yarn around the pegs and working back and forth across rows to knit the loops. Continue until scarf is the length desired.  After a few rows, knit material comes through the bottom of the loom. Measure the knitted material to determine where the scarf will end. Four rows creates 1” (2.5 cm) of knit material. For a scarf five feet long or 60” (152 cm), knit about 240 rows on the loom.","output":"To create a neat-looking scarf using a loom, ensure proper tension by pressing down on the yarn between the pegs with the side of the hand.

Until a few hundred years ago, not many people were taught to read, so there was a lot more reading out loud by the few people who could. To help those reading out loud in the old days, sign  known as \\"points\\" were added to pages of writing. Punctuation comes from the Latin word punctus, meaning \\"point\\". These points told readers when to pause  or take a breath, and what to emphasize . In Europe from the early centuries AD, these points were widely used although not everybody used the same points for the same thing. When printing was invented, printers had to be made more clearly about what to put where, so that everyone was doing the same thing.

The sort we have in English today began to be widely used during the 18th century. Before that readers simply understood from the way a sentence was written that someone was speaking although sometimes spoken words were underlined. Comma , colon: period(full stop). All three of these sorts of punctuation marks were given their Greek names by Aristophanes, a librarian who lived in Byzantium in the 2nd century BC. They were marks on the page, each with a message to the reader. Comma meant a short pause. Colon meant a medium  sized pause. Period meant a long pause. Exclamation mark! In the early days of punctuation, if you saw this sign, you were supposed to pause. Some people think the exclamation mark began as what the Greek word IO looked like if it was turned 90 degrees. This word means \\"Oh, gosh!\\" With the I on the top and the O under it, the sign as we know it today was developed. Question mark?

(CNN) -- Georgian authorities foiled an attempted army mutiny that they believe was designed to disrupt planned NATO exercises in the former Soviet republic, the country's interior ministry said Tuesday. Georgian troops take part in military exercises in January. They are to participate in NATO maneuvers this week. About 500 troops at a military base outside the capital, Tbilisi, were involved in the rebellion, said Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili. He said it was quickly brought under control, and the government reported a few hours later that the base was calm. Initial investigations suggest that Russia, Georgia's northern neighbor and former ruler, may have had a hand in the mutiny, Utiashvili said.","output":"(CNN) -- Georgian authorities averted an attempted army mutiny on Tuesday, which they suspect was planned to destabilize the upcoming NATO exercises in the former Soviet republic, according to the country's interior ministry. Georgian troops, who previously participated in military exercises in January, are scheduled to be part of NATO maneuvers this week. Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili confirmed that approximately 500 troops stationed at a military base just outside the capital city of Tbilisi were implicated in the rebellion. Utiashvili stated that the swift intervention of Georgian authorities effectively brought the situation under control, preventing the mutiny from escalating further. The government released an update a few hours after the initial reports, indicating that the military base had returned to a state of normalcy and calm. The authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the motives behind the mutiny and those involved in its planning and execution. Preliminary findings appear to point towards Russia, Georgia's northern neighbor and former ruler, as a possible orchestrator of the foiled mutiny, said Utiashvili. As tensions between Georgia and Russia have a history of volatility, with the two countries battling over disputed territories such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia, this attempted disruption of NATO exercises could be seen as Russia attempting to weaken Georgia's ties to the Western military alliance. However, Utiashvili reiterated that these suspicions remain unconfirmed, and the investigation is ongoing to determine the full extent of Russia's potential involvement. Considering the gravity of the situation, Georgian authorities are expected to collaborate with NATO and other partner countries to scrutinize the underlying machinations behind the mutiny and devise strategies to prevent future incidents. The thwarted mutiny and its possible link to Russia underscore the challenges countries like Georgia face while navigating complex international relationships in an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape. The results of the ongoing investigation could impact existing diplomatic ties and military alliances in the region, and might place extra scrutiny on Russia's role in regional stability. In response to the incident, both NATO and Georgian officials have expressed their commitment to ensuring the planned NATO exercises in Georgia proceed as scheduled, as any disruptions could undermine the credibility of the Western military alliance. These collaborative exercises are seen as vital for maintaining regional stability and preparedness in the face of evolving security threats, while also showcasing Georgia's military capabilities and dedication to working with NATO forces."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which language is this?","output":"The language used in the given sentence is Romanian.  Translation: \\"In the case where European consumers would be offered slightly cheaper textiles, would this pose a problem?\\" Addressing the question, offering slightly cheaper textiles to European consumers could potentially have both advantages and disadvantages, depending on different factors such as production methods, overall quality, and impact on the local economy. Advantages: 1. Increased affordability: Cheaper textiles make clothing and other textile products more affordable for a larger portion of the population. This can particularly benefit low-income families by reducing their expenses on essential clothing items. 2. Increased demand for products: Lower prices might drive an increase in demand for textile products, which in turn, can incentivize manufacturers to boost or maintain production levels. Disadvantages: 1. Lower quality: There may be concerns that cheaper textiles could be of lower quality due to the cost-cutting measures taken during production. This might lead to shorter product lifespans and more frequent replacements, causing more waste and higher consumption of resources. 2. Impact on local businesses: Cheaper textiles, especially if they are imported, could negatively affect local textile manufacturers and small businesses, which could struggle to compete with the lower-priced competition. This may result in job losses, reduced investments in innovation, and long-term damage to the local economy. 3. Ethical and environmental concerns: Lower-priced textiles may be produced in countries with less stringent labor and environmental regulations, raising concerns about the exploitation of workers and negligence of environmental protections. European consumers may be contributing to these issues indirectly by purchasing cheaper textiles. Overall, providing slightly cheaper textiles to European consumers has both positive and negative implications. The actual impact depends on the balance between affordability and quality, as well as the potential consequences on local businesses and ethical/environmental considerations. It is essential for consumers, businesses, and regulators to be informed and make choices that promote sustainable and responsible consumption."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cyber language is popular among Chinese netizens, who create English words to reflect novel phenomenon in society.  \\"Gelivable\\", combining pinyin of Chinese characters Geili (giving strength) with the English suffix for adjectives, literally means \\"giving power\\" or \\"cool\\". Similarly, \\"Hengelivable\\" means \\"very cool\\", and \\"ungelivable\\" means \\"dull, not cool at al\\". \\"Antizen\\" referred to the group of college graduates who, earning a poor salary and living in small rented apartments, are like the tiny and laborious ants.  David Tool, a professor with the Beijing International Studies University said it's very interesting to combine Chinese with English to create new words. \\"English is no longer mysterious to the Chinese people.

This three-character expression, which originally meant \\"you win\\" with the first character carrying the same pronunciation as garlic in Chinese, is used to satirize high garlic and food prices this winter.  Chinese people use the character \\"bei\\" before a verb to show a passive voice, and it is used by netizens to show the helplessness in front of false conclusions and fake media reports. For instance, \\"zisha\\" means \\"suicide\\" while \\"beizisha\\" means \\"be officially presumed to have committed suicide\\", and xiaokang means \\"fairly comfortable life\\" while \\"beixiaokang\\" means \\"be said to be living a fairly comfortable life\\".

Can you guess? Question: What's Mimi's favorite food? Options: A: Eggs. B: Fish. C: Rice. D: Fruit Answer:","output":"Based on the given article, Mimi has explicitly mentioned their favorite food. They said, \\"Do you know my favorite food? It is fish.\\" Therefore, the correct answer is B: Fish. The other options can be eliminated for the following reasons: A: Eggs - There is no mention of eggs in the article, so this cannot be considered as Mimi's favorite food. C: Rice - Again, there is no mention of rice in the article, and it is not connected to Mimi's preferences in any way. D: Fruit - In the article, we can see that Mimi specifically mentions not liking apples. Although apples are a type of fruit, we can still eliminate this option, as it is unlikely that her favorite food would belong to a category that consists of something she dislikes. The article gives us a clear idea of Mimi's preferences and characteristics. We know that Mimi is black and white, likes sitting on a chair in the sun during winter, climbs trees, and can \\"sing\\" by saying \\"miao, miao.\\" These clues also suggest that Mimi is a cat, as cats are known for their ability to climb trees and make \\"miao\\" sounds.

Let's break down each sentence: 1. \\"It has a legendary 1814 shoot on fresh artists from Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire to UB40, picture on the wall.\\" This sentence seems to suggest that a legendary \\"shoot\\" (which might refer to a photography or videography session, or possibly a creative project) took place in 1814, focusing on \\"fresh artists\\" like Johnny Cash and UB40. The sentence further refers to specific works (Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\" and UB40's \\"Picture on the Wall\\") as examples of the content in this shoot. Although the word '1814' seems out of place, as Johnny Cash and UB40 were not involved in music during that time, the focus seems to be on the legendary shoot or project. 2. \\"It features a fresh 1814 spin on legendary artists from Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire to UB40, Picture on the wall.\\" In this sentence, the project or collection is described as having a \\"fresh 1814 spin\\" on the works of legendary artists such as Johnny Cash and UB40. This suggests that the collection puts a new and modern twist on the works of these artists, which might involve reinterpretation, remixing, or reimagining of their music. Again, the number '1814' seems out of context but the focus of this sentence is more on presenting these classic works in a new and fresh manner. In conclusion, while both sentences revolve around the idea of a creative project that involves artists like Johnny Cash and UB40, the first sentence emphasizes the legendary shoot or project itself and the fresh artists involved, while the second sentence highlights the fresh spin or reinterpretation of the artists' works. Hence, they convey slightly different meanings or focus on different aspects of the project."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.  - The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, often referred to as The Guggenheim, is an art museum located at 1071 Fifth Avenue on the corner of East 89th Street in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It is the permanent home of a continuously expanding collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary art and also features special exhibitions throughout the year. The museum was established by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, the artist Hilla von Rebay. It adopted its current name after the death of its founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim, in 1952.  - Abstract art uses a visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.  - Morris Louis , born Morris Louis Bernstein ( November 28 , 1912 -- September 7 , 1962 ) , was an American painter . During the 1950s he became one of the earliest exponents of Color Field painting . Living in Washington , D.C. Louis , along with Kenneth Noland and other Washington painters formed an art movement that is known today as the Washington Color School .  - Abstract expressionism is a postWorld War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City at the center of the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term \\"abstract expressionism\\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine \\"Der Sturm\\", regarding German Expressionism. In the United States, Alfred Barr was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by Wassily Kandinsky.  - The Walker Art Center is a multidisciplinary contemporary art center in the Lowry Hill neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The Walker is one of the most-visited modern and contemporary art museums in the United States and, together with the adjacent Minneapolis Sculpture Garden and the Cowles Conservatory, it has an annual attendance of around 700,000 visitors. The museum's permanent collection includes over 13,000 modern and contemporary art pieces including books, costumes, drawings, media works, paintings, photography, prints, and sculpture.  - The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden is an art museum beside the National Mall, in Washington, D.C., the United States. The museum was initially endowed during the 1960s with the permanent art collection of Joseph H. Hirshhorn. It was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It was conceived as the United States' museum of contemporary and modern art and currently focuses its collection-building and exhibition-planning mainly on the postWorld War II period, with particular emphasis on art made during the last 50 years.  - The Washington Gallery of Modern Art was a short-lived gallery promoting contemporary art near Dupont Circle in Washington, DC, United States, during the 1960s. Its collection of 153 works was purchased by the Oklahoma City Museum of Art in 1968 for 110,000. The collection included 20th-century artists, Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Indiana, Grace Hartigan and Marcel Duchamp.  - Tate is an institution that houses the United Kingdom's national collection of British art, and international modern and contemporary art. It is a network of four art museums: Tate Britain, London (until 2000 known as the Tate Gallery, founded 1897), Tate Liverpool (founded 1988), Tate St Ives, Cornwall (founded 1993) and Tate Modern, London (founded 2000), with a complementary website, Tate Online (created 1998). Tate is not a government institution, but its main sponsor is the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.  - Helen Frankenthaler (December 12, 1928  December 27, 2011) was an American abstract expressionist painter. She was a major contributor to the history of postwar American painting. Having exhibited her work for over six decades (early 1950s until 2011), she spanned several generations of abstract painters while continuing to produce vital and ever-changing new work. Frankenthaler began exhibiting her large-scale abstract expressionist paintings in contemporary museums and galleries in the early 1950s. She was included in the 1964 \\"Post-Painterly Abstraction\\" exhibition curated by Clement Greenberg that introduced a newer generation of abstract painting that came to be known as Color Field. Born in Manhattan, she was influenced by Greenberg, Hans Hofmann, and Jackson Pollock's paintings. Her work has been the subject of several retrospective exhibitions, including a 1989 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and been exhibited worldwide since the 1950s. In 2001, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts.  - Kenneth Noland (April 10, 1924  January 5, 2010) was an American painter. He was one of the best-known American Color Field painters, although in the 1950s he was thought of as an abstract expressionist and in the early 1960s he was thought of as a minimalist painter. Noland helped establish the Washington Color School movement. In 1977, he was honored by a major retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York that then traveled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. and Ohio's Toledo Museum of Art in 1978. In 2006, Noland's \\"Stripe Paintings\\" were exhibited at the Tate in London.  - Color Field painting is a style of abstract painting that emerged in New York City during the 1940s and 1950s. It was inspired by European modernism and closely related to Abstract Expressionism, while many of its notable early proponents were among the pioneering Abstract Expressionists. Color Field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid color spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favour of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting \\"color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself.\\"  - A visual-art movement of the late 1950s through the late-1960s centered in Washington, D.C., the Washington Color School describes a form of abstract art that developed from color field painting, itself a form of abstract art that explored ways to use large solid areas of paint, as exemplified by the work of Mark Rothko and Helen Frankenthaler. The Washington Color School originally consisted of a group of painters who showed works in an exhibit called the \\"Washington Color Painters\\" at the now-defunct Washington Gallery of Modern Art in Washington from June 25 to September 5, 1965. This exhibition, which subsequently traveled to several other venues in the United States, including the Walker Art Center, solidified Washington's place in the national movement and defined what is considered the city's signature art movement. The exhibition's organizer was Gerald \\"Gerry\\" Nordland and the painters included Gene Davis, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Howard Mehring, Thomas \\"Tom\\" Downing, and Paul Reed.

We buy our own food and I had given my parents 5000 to pay off debt so that’s my justification for not paying utilities. They told us they couldn’t afford the house if we moved out and that we never even pay utilities. I asked them why not get a smaller house since the lease was up?

To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down.  and a hint : Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  Please answer this question : Would stage B see increased of decreased pressure than stage C? Answer:","output":"Stage B would see increased pressure compared to stage C. In the given situation, Rob experiments with a cylinder of gas in three stages (A, B, and C). During stage A, the gas is kept at room temperature (300 K). In stage B, the gas is heated, causing its temperature to increase. In stage C, the gas is cooled down, causing its temperature to decrease. Based on the hint provided, when the gas temperature doubles from 300 K (room temperature) to 600 K (heated), the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases. This leads to more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, resulting in a doubling of the gas pressure.  Conversely, when the gas temperature decreases (as it would in stage C, where the gas is cooled), the collisions between gas molecules and the container walls become less forceful, leading to a decrease in pressure.

She attends groups with her two friends, Alisha (Julia Garro) and Phil (Adam Wagner). One evening after giving a speech about the purity ring worn by members of the group, she is introduced to Tobey (Hale Appleman) and finds him attractive. The four begin going out as a group. Dawn has fantasies about marrying Tobey, although after acknowledging the attraction, they agree that they cannot spend time together. Soon after they give in and meet at a local swimming hole. After swimming together, they go into a cave to get warm and begin kissing. Dawn gets uncomfortable and tries to get them to go back. Tobey then attempts to rape Dawn, who panics and tries to push him off. Tobey becomes aggressive and shakes Dawn, resulting in her smacking her head on the ground. While she is dazed, Tobey takes the opportunity to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina. A horrified Dawn stumbles away and she flees the scene. After a Promise meeting, she meets her classmate Ryan (Ashley Springer) at a dance; they talk, and he drops her off at her home. Dawn drops her purity ring off a cliff and goes back to the swimming hole. She screams in horror when she sees a freshwater crab crawling on Tobey's penis.

More than one million motorists from around the world have exchanged their foreign licences for a British one in the last 15 years, it emerged today. According the figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the number of licences exchanged per year. peaked at 96,935 in 2007, before falling to 79,187 in 2009. Over the. past three years, the number has risen steadily once again, reaching. 83,553 in 2011. Currently, the UK recognises the driving licences awarded to drivers by 50. other countries, meaning they. can be exchanged after 12 months of residency for a UK licence without. the holder needing to pass any UK test. Drivers from 50 countries can exchange their licence for a British one after 12 months without taking a test. Almost half of the licences swapped. since 1997 have been gained in a country where the driving test doesn't. include driving on the left. Robin Reames, chief claims officer at. swiftcover.com which uncovered the figures, said: 'These figures reflect Britain's. multi-cultural society demonstrating that we are welcoming an increasing. number of motorists to our shores who are choosing to live and drive. here. 'However, UK roads are very different to those overseas so it's. vital that new motorists learn as much as they can, which could include. taking a few lessons from an instructor if necessary.' Since 1997, drivers from South Africa and Australia accounted for the highest number of licences exchanged with 149,897 and. 103,053 respectively. However, as more countries entered the EU in 2004,. allowing licences to be exchanged from eastern European countries,. Polish (135,079 – average of 8,442 per year), Bulgarian (18,719) and. Hungarian (21,714) motorists are actively exchanging their licences. About 88,000 Polish drivers exchanged their licence for a UK version in the. five years between 2004 and 2008. The data goes on to show that on. average each year since 1997, 2,334 drivers exchanged Japanese licences for UK one. Figures also show. 2,895 drivers exchanged Hong Kong licences and 836 drivers exchanged. South Korean licences for full British permits. Research carried out by the BBC earlier this year highlighted a scam where drivers obtained a UK driving. licence by exploiting the arrangement that the UK has with Hong Kong –. which saw more than 6,000 exchanged every year for the past five years,. even though the average is much lower. Agreements also exist with some African. countries. Around 950 Zimbabwean licences were exchanged in 2011, down from. 1,282 in 2010 and a peak of 6,168 in 2002. Nearly half of the licences exchanged since 1997 are from countries where the test does not require driving on the left hand lane. The UK's agreement with Kenya. was suspended in 2002 then later reinstated, resulting in 242 Kenyan. licences being exchanged in the early part of 2012. Robin Reames added: 'While the fact. that the UK recognises licences issued in certain countries shows that. driving tests in those countries are likely to be of a high standard,. it's important to recognise that driving in the UK is unique in many. ways. 'As such, it's important for everyone planning to drive in the UK. to take the time to become familiar with UK road signs and speed limits,. as well as driver etiquette – exactly as British motorists should when. driving abroad.' Nick Perry, driving instructor at. Bristol-based Oasis Driving School, commented: 'People who learned to. drive abroad will often face difficulties driving in the UK. 'The obvious. differences include driving on a different side of the road and new. signs and speed limits, but there are also more subtle differences such. as etiquette on the road that seem obvious to us, but are extremely. important. 'I've taught a range of drivers who have originally learned. to drive outside the UK, some of whom have settled in with no problems. and others who've needed a little help. 'It's a good idea for anyone new. to UK roads to take a short lesson or two with an approved driving. instructor in order to be on the safe side.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is saying that in the last 15 years, over one million people from other countries have traded their old driving licenses for British ones. The number of people doing this has gone up and down, but was the highest in 2007. People from 50 different countries can change their licenses after living in the UK for 12 months without needing to take a special UK driving test.  A lot of the people trading their licenses are from countries where they don't learn to drive on the left side of the road like in the UK. Some experts think it's important for these new drivers to learn about UK road signs, speed limits, and how to be polite on the road. They suggest that new drivers might want to take a few driving lessons with a teacher in the UK, even if they already know how to drive in their own country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.  Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... What did Trump think of Sen. Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee? - Trump is frustrated with his attempts to make Trump look bad - not enough information - Trump is indifferent - Trump is happy that Warner works hard Answer:","output":"President Donald Trump has expressed frustration with Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and his involvement in the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. Trump is likely displeased with Warner's attempts to expose any potential wrongdoings by his campaign, as it may create a negative image of his administration and fuel doubts about the validity of his presidency. Warner has been assertive in his efforts to get to the bottom of the issue, saying, \\"I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important.\\" Such a determined approach in conducting the investigation may have contributed to Trump's consternation regarding Warner, as the president has repeatedly dismissed the probe as a \\"WITCH HUNT\\" and a \\"Democrat hoax.\\" Furthermore, Trump has publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the ongoing investigation as he believes it casts a \\"phony cloud\\" over his administration, hindering its performance and damaging its image. The strenuous relationship between Sen. Mark Warner and President Trump can be inferred from these circumstances, indicating that Trump is certainly frustrated with Warner's endeavors and considers them as attempts to besmirch his presidency. In conclusion, President Trump is unlikely to be indifferent or happy with Sen. Mark Warner's involvement in the investigation. Instead, Trump's sentiments lean more towards frustration, as Warner's persistence in uncovering the truth risks exposing potentially damaging information that could impact Trump's administration and legacy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Namibia (i/nəˈmɪbiə/, /næˈ-/), officially the Republic of Namibia (German:  Republik Namibia (help·info); Afrikaans: Republiek van Namibië) is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates it from that country. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How far away is Namibia to the Zambezi River?","output":"Namibia is located in the southwestern part of Africa, and the Zambezi River, one of Africa's major river systems, forms part of the border between Namibia and its northeastern neighbor, Zambia. While Namibia does not share a direct border with Zimbabwe, a small section of the Zambezi River, less than 200 meters in length, separates the two countries. The distance between Namibia and the Zambezi River varies depending on which part of the country you are measuring from. In the northeastern corner of Namibia, the Caprivi Strip, the Zambezi River is only about 200 meters away from the border, as mentioned earlier. The Caprivi Strip is a narrow panhandle of Namibian territory extending eastwards from the main body of the country and provides Namibia with access to the Zambezi River. If measuring from central Namibia, such as the capital city of Windhoek, the distance to the Zambezi River would be greater. The approximate distance from Windhoek to the Zambezi River, in a straight line, is around 900 kilometers (559 miles). However, please note that this measure provides only an estimate of the distance, as the actual distance may vary due to geographical factors and the specific location of the river along the border between Namibia and Zambia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If I tell you that Friction causes a car to lose energy, and ask you the question \\"what causes a car to lose energy?\\", is the correct answer \\"temperature\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"what causes a car to lose energy?\\" is not \\"temperature.\\" While temperature can play a role in affecting a car's performance, it is not the main factor that causes a car to lose energy. Instead, the primary cause of energy loss in a car, as you mentioned, is friction. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are in contact with each other. In the context of a car, there are different sources of friction that contribute to energy loss: 1. Rolling resistance: This is the friction between the tires of the car and the road surface. Rolling resistance is affected by the materials and design of both the tires and the road surface, as well as the weight of the car. As the tires roll on the road, they deform and generate heat, causing energy to be lost in the form of heat. 2. Air resistance (drag): As a car moves, it has to push through the surrounding air, causing resistance. The faster the car moves, the greater the air resistance it has to overcome. The shape of a car and its frontal area determine how much air resistance it will experience. 3. Mechanical friction: All the moving parts of a car – like the engine, transmission, and wheels – have to overcome friction as they move and interact with each other. The energy lost as a result of this friction is typically dissipated in the form of heat. 4. Internal engine losses: Various factors within a combustion engine, such as pumping losses, heat generation, and drivetrain losses can cause a car to lose energy. 5. Braking: When brakes are applied, the kinetic energy of the moving car is converted into heat, leading to energy loss. While temperature doesn't directly cause a car to lose energy, it can affect the efficiency of various components and processes within the car, thereby influencing energy loss indirectly. For example, extreme cold may thicken engine oil, leading to increased friction and energy loss in the engine. Similarly, high temperatures can make some components, like tires and engine parts, behave differently, potentially increasing energy loss. In summary, friction is the primary cause of energy loss in a car, with rolling resistance, air resistance, mechanical friction, internal engine losses, and braking being contributors. Temperature is not the direct cause of energy loss; however, it can indirectly influence how various components and processes within the car contribute to energy loss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The review mentioned would likely decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons.  Firstly, the reviewer states that the slippers were too tight and pointed, which indicates that the product may be uncomfortable and not suitable for people with different foot shapes or sizes. This lack of adaptability in the product's design could lead to dissatisfaction and discomfort for potential buyers, especially those who have unique or particular preferences in terms of fit and comfort. Secondly, the reviewer describes the slippers as being slippery on wood floors, which raises concerns about safety. Anyone considering this product would likely prioritize the ability to walk securely on various surfaces, and slippery slippers could easily result in accidents and falls, especially for the elderly or those with mobility issues. This factor alone could be a significant deterrent for potential buyers, as it compromises on the fundamental aspect of safety that footwear should provide. Lastly, the reviewer specifically points out that these slippers are not appropriate for elderly individuals. This statement highlights that this product lacks an essential element of accessibility and usability for a certain demographic. Elderly people may have more specific needs when it comes to slippers, such as non-slip soles, a more comfortable fit, and ease of put on and take off. As the product seems to fail in meeting these needs, any potential buyer who has elderly family members or is considering their own aging process might be discouraged from purchasing this product. In summary, the negative review addressing various issues with the product, such as discomfort, lack of safety, and inappropriateness for elderly individuals, would likely decrease the chances of buying the product.

While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him. At first, he is mistaken for a murderer by the four people because he shoots at them through the door (mistaking them as the Evil Force), but they find out the truth after listening to a recording of Annie's father, Professor Knowby, that talked about how his wife Henrietta...

Question: \\"What was founded in the 28th year of the 17th century?\\"  Context: \\"Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, John Locke, the Glorious Revolution, the English Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement. Later, the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In North America, Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers. These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God. The Mayflower Compact was a social contract.\\"  Answer:","output":"In the 28th year of the 17th century, which corresponds to the year 1628, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded in North America. This event is quite significant in the historical context you provided on the development of democracy, particularly in relation to the Protestant religious beliefs associated with it. The Massachusetts Bay Colony was an English settlement established on the east coast of North America, in present-day Massachusetts. The colony was founded by a group of English Puritans, who were looking for a place where they could practice their religion freely, without the restrictions imposed by the Church of England. The Puritans were adherents of Calvinism, and they strongly believed in democratic self-rule and the separation of powers, as they thought that this form of government aligned with the will of God. The foundation of the Massachusetts Bay Colony played a significant role in the development of democratic ideals in the British colonies. Along with the Plymouth Colony, founded earlier in 1620 by the Pilgrim Fathers, these Congregationalist settlements practiced democratic governance based on a social contract among the settlers. This democratic approach, guided by religious principles, laid the groundwork for the future establishment of American democracy and the United States' political system. In summary, the Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1628, marked an important step in the evolution of democracy in North America, driven by the Calvinist-inspired belief in self-rule and powered by English Puritans seeking religious freedom. This colony, together with the Plymouth Colony and other historical events and figures, laid the foundation for modern democratic systems, not only in the United States but also in other former British colonies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip.

But, deep down, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented cast intact...De Bont and company will not ruin a film, who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety.

Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us.

The guard, named Thomas, preferred his trusty blade over a gun for a few reasons. First, he had trained extensively in close-quarters combat, which sharpened his skills and instincts. Second, the silent nature of a blade allowed him to work covertly, without alerting nearby enemies. As the moonlight seeped through the cracks in the old walls of the abandoned warehouse, Thomas scanned the area with his keen eyes, searching for any signs of movement. He'd heard rumors of a new criminal organization taking root in this part of the city, and he was determined to quell this threat before it could grow any further. Step by step, he patrolled the perimeter of the warehouse, listening closely for any sounds out of place. The building groaned and creaked, betraying its age and years of neglect. The sound of footsteps would be muffled by the thick layer of dust that covered the floor, but Thomas' ears were exceptionally keen. He was confident he'd be able to hear even the slightest footfall if someone were to approach. As the night wore on, Thomas began to wonder whether the rumors were just that - rumors. He considered the possibility that these whispers were merely the panicked talk of frightened locals, desperate to blame their struggles on an external force. But as his thoughts meandered, a sudden noise jolted him back to reality. The sound of shattering glass echoed through the warehouse as a dark figure hurtled through one of the high windows. Despite the surprise, Thomas reacted with practiced calm, drawing his blade and taking a defensive posture. He cautiously made his way towards the source of the noise, his heart pounding in anticipation. As he neared the broken window, he spotted the figure, clad in black attire and a ski mask, trying to pick themselves up from the pile of shattered glass. With the ease of a seasoned warrior, Thomas closed the distance swiftly, positioning himself between the intruder and any possible escape routes. He raised his blade, never flinching, and spoke in a stern voice. \\"Who are you, and what business have you in this place?\\" The intruder hesitated, seemingly weighing their options. Thomas knew that it was in moments like this when one had to make a choice - to fight or flee. It became evident that this intruder was determined to face him head-on, as they reached into their coat and produced a weapon of their own. With a metallic click, Thomas recognized the unmistakable sound of a knife being drawn. It seemed this opponent was more evenly matched than he had anticipated.

Article:The report estimates that hepatitis infections and their complications led to 1.45m deaths in 2013 - despite the existence of vaccines and treatments. World Health Organization data shows there were 1.2m Aids-related deaths in 2014, while TB led to 1.5m deaths. The WHO has put forward a global strategy to tackle hepatitis. Researchers say these plans must be put into action urgently to tackle the crisis. Viral hepatitis refers to five different forms of virus (known as A, B, C, D, E) - some can be spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and others (A and E) through contaminated food or water. Most deaths worldwide are due to B and C, which can cause serious liver damage and predispose people to liver cancer. But because people don't always feel the symptoms of the initial infection, they can be unaware of the long-term damage until it is too late. Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Washington examined data from 183 countries, collected between 1990 and 2013. They found the the number of deaths linked to viral hepatitis rose by more than 60% over two decades - partly due to a growing population. Deaths from diseases such as TB and malaria have dropped. Dr Graham Cooke of Imperial College London described the findings as startling. He said: \\"Although there are effective treatments and vaccines for viral hepatitis, there is very little money invested in getting these to patients - especially compared to malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB. \\"We have tools at our disposal to treat this disease - we have vaccines to treat hepatitis A and B and we have new treatments for C. \\"However the price of new medicines is beyond the reach of any country - rich or poor.\\" The study suggests the problem is biggest in East Asia. But unlike many other diseases, deaths from viral hepatitis were higher in high and middle income countries than in lower income nations. The WHO hepatitis strategy, which was put forward in May 2016,  includes targets to reduce new cases of hepatitis B and C by 30% by 2020, alongside a 10% reduction in mortality. The WHO says countries and organisations will need to expand vaccination programmes, focus on preventing mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B and increase access to treatment for hepatitis B and C, to help ensure these targets are met.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which of the following traits was not valued in classical Greek art: calm, perfected, or erotic? Context: Hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos). The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.

Article: The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called \\"kef\\" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \\"kef\\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of \\"kef music\\" heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star Cher. Ruben Hakobyan (Ruben Sasuntsi) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent. In the Armenian diaspora, Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth.[citation needed] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes. Now answer this question: What type of music does Sirusho perform?","output":"Sirusho performs pop music that is combined with Armenian folk music elements, creating a unique blend that appeals to both the Armenian diaspora and contemporary entertainment industry audiences.

A Brief History of Whitefield The town of Whitefield was incorporated in 1774, initially named \\"New Boston Plantation\\" in honor of the settlers who came from Boston, Massachusetts. However, the name was changed just a few years later in 1804 to Whitefield in honor of Reverend George Whitefield, an influential English preacher. The town flourished throughout the 19th century, mainly due to its location at the center of several major trade routes, including the iconic Boston Post Road, which contributed to its development as a hub for trade, agriculture, and logging. Historical Treasures and Sites Whitefield boasts several fascinating historical sites that serve as a testament to the town's rich heritage. The central Whitefield Town Common, first established in 1804, is one such site, still meticulously maintained and acting as the centerpiece of the town, surrounded by many of the original buildings from that era. One of the most notable of these buildings is the Whitefield Congregational Church, an immaculate, white building dating back to 1861. With its inherent charm, the town common is the perfect spot for residents and visitors to enjoy a picnic in the sun or take a leisurely stroll in the tree-lined surroundings. Nearly five miles from the town center is the iconic Hazelton Bridge. Built in 1881, it is the last remaining covered bridge in Whitefield, spanning the John's River. The bridge is preserved and maintained by the New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources, serving as a reminder of the area's history and the ingenuity of its early settlers.

The battle was a major part of Operation Cartwheel , the main Allied strategy in the South West Pacific Area and Pacific Ocean Areas during 1943 -- 44 , and was the second World War II landing of the U.S. 1st Marine Division , after Guadalcanal .  - The Territory of New Guinea was an Australian administered territory on the island of New Guinea from 1920 until 1975. In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of Papua were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971. Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of New Guinea at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.  - Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province, on the island of New Britain, in the country of Papua New Guinea. New Britain is an island about 60 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash of a volcanic eruption.  - New Britain, is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago (named after Otto von Bismarck) of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern (\\"New Pomerania\\").  - Kimbe is the capital of the province of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. It is a port town on the great Kimbe Bay which boasts more than 60 percent of the coral species of the entire Indo-Pacific. The bustling town of Kimbe is the third largest port in Papua New Guinea and is the fastest growing city in the South Pacific. Accommodation in Kimbe is readily available in many high-class resorts and hotels, as well as many budget guesthouses and motels dribbled along the province. The town of Kimbe is served by Hoskins Airport.  - Vitiaz Strait is a strait between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, northern New Guinea.   - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - German New Guinea was the first part of the German colonial empire. It was a protectorate from 1884 until 1914 when it fell to Australian forces following the outbreak of the First World War. It consisted of the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The mainland part of German New Guinea and the nearby islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Micronesian islands of German New Guinea are now governed as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau.  - Operation Cartwheel (19431944) was a major military strategy for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. Cartwheel was a twin-axis of advance operation, aimed at militarily neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA)General Douglas MacArthurwhose forces advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the Pacific Ocean Areas commandunder Admiral Chester W. Nimitzadvanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the US and various Pacific Islands.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Cape Gloucester (also known as Tuluvu) is a headland on the northern side of the far west of the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese captured New Britain, and had driven most of Cape Gloucester's native population out to construct two airfields. During the New Britain Campaign, American forces had decided to capture Cape Gloucester for its two airfields, to assist planned attacks on the garrison on Rabaul, an important area in New Britain. It became the site of the Battle of Cape Gloucester, part of Operation Cartwheel, in 1943. After long fighting through rain, and Japanese, the United States 1st Marine Division had it declared secured. After the war, the headland was given back to the natives.  - Papua New Guinea (PNG  Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815  30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, significantly and deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.\\"  - The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km.  - Kokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. As a result, the population of the town increased more than sixfold from 3,150 in 1990 to 20,262 in 2000.  - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.  - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region.  - The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a Protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called \\"British New Guinea\\". There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened \\"on or about\\" 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua.

Jack William Nicklaus (born January 21, 1940), nicknamed The Golden Bear, is an American retired professional golfer. He is widely regarded as the greatest golfer of all time, winning a record 18 career major championships, while producing 19 second-place and 9 third-place finishes, over a span of 25 years. Nicklaus focused on the major championships--Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship--and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (79). In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. These victories and placements more than justified the work Nicklaus put in toward his game during the off-season.  Nicklaus set a new scoring record for the 1980 U.S. Open with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open. This was Nicklaus's second major win at Baltusrol Golf Club. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki's aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a U.S. Open runner-up. Nicklaus' win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan. Nicklaus referred to this win as \\"by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country\\".  In the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set another record in winning the championship by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club, largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and was the only player to break par for the 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory's McIroy's 2012 victory. This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did he win any awards?","output":"The text does not directly mention any specific awards that Jack Nicklaus won.

First question: How do you find the owner of a vehicle? Second question: How can I find the owner of a vehicle? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing but they may be interpreted as representing two slightly different contexts. They are both seeking guidance on how to determine the ownership of a vehicle. The difference exists in point of view of the asker: 1. \\"How do you find the owner of a vehicle?\\" - This question can be seen as asking a general question to the public or an expert on how one would go about determining vehicle ownership. 2. \\"How can I find the owner of a vehicle?\\" - This is a more direct question, indicating that the person asking the question specifically wants to know how they, personally, could find out who owns a particular vehicle. Next, let's address how to find the owner of a vehicle. Finding the owner of a vehicle can be a complex process as privacy laws and regulations protect such information to safeguard the privacy of individuals. However, there are several official ways you can attempt to find this information: 1. **License Plate Lookup** – If you have the license plate number of the vehicle, you can use it to search for ownership information. However, many online license plate lookup services do not provide owner information due to privacy laws unless you're a law enforcement officer or have a valid legal reason. 2. **VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) Check** – A vehicle's unique VIN can be used to find specific information about the vehicle, but not the owner. While this method won’t directly disclose the owner, it can give you insight into the vehicle's history. 3. **Contact Law Enforcement** – Law enforcement might assist with the owner's information under circumstances related to law enforcement purposes. 4. **Request Information from DMV** – The Department of Motor Vehicles in your local area may have records of vehicle ownership. However, you usually need a valid reason related to lawsuits or potential vehicle purchase or transfers. 5. **Private Investigator** – If the situation is serious enough (like a hit-and-run or theft case), it may be worth hiring a licensed private investigator. They have more power to access private information due to their license. 6. **Neighborhood Canvas** – If the need arises from a local issue, such as a vehicle blocking your driveway, you can knock on neighbors' doors to find out who owns the car. Remember, while finding details about a vehicle's owner, it’s essential to respect people's privacy and abide by all relevant laws and regulations. If it's for a purpose that directly impacts your wellbeing, it's recommended that you contact law enforcement or legal professionals to take up the matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town.  and a hint : Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  Please answer this question : Who will be more likely to cause excess growth of algae in their respective lakes? Answer:","output":"Jimbo will be more likely to cause excess growth of algae in his respective lake due to his increased use of fertilizers on his farm. In the given situation, Jimbo has been experiencing high demand for his products, causing him to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farm. On the other hand, Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products are not as popular among the people in his town. The hint provided explains that large quantities of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields. When it rains, some of these chemicals are picked up by the rainwater and carried away as runoff to nearby rivers or lakes. In these bodies of water, the dissolved fertilizer can cause an overgrowth of water plants and algae, which in turn can lead to the formation of dead zones where nothing can live. Based on this information, it can be inferred that Jimbo, who is using high amounts of fertilizers, has a greater likelihood of causing excess growth of algae in his lake. The runoff from his farm could carry substantial amounts of dissolved fertilizer to the lake, promoting the proliferation of algae and potentially resulting in the creation of a dead zone. This could have severe consequences not only for the ecosystem of the lake but also for the local community, who may rely on the lake as a water source or food supply. In contrast, Jedd's decision to reduce the use of fertilizers on his farm due to decreased demand lessens the risk of his actions contributing to an overgrowth of algae in his respective lake. By reducing the application of chemicals, there is a lower probability that runoff from Jedd's farm will contain significant amounts of dissolved fertilizer, which would potentially encourage excessive growth of water plants and algae. As a result, Jedd's lake is less likely to experience the detrimental ecological effects associated with fertilizer-induced algal blooms. In conclusion, Jimbo is more likely to cause excess growth of algae in his respective lake due to his increased use of fertilizers on his farm. It would be beneficial for Jimbo to consider adopting more sustainable farming practices, such as reducing the quantity of fertilizers used or implementing integrated pest management strategies, in order to minimize the impact of his actions on the local environment and water resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response... Answer:","output":"The full name of the person John Lennon became involved with in a protest is Tariq Ali. Tariq Ali is a British Pakistani writer, journalist, and filmmaker who expressed his revolutionary political views during an interview with Lennon in January 1971. As a result of their shared views, Lennon and Ali joined forces in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\" and collaborated with Yoko Ono as Elastic Oz Band to release the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" in support of the magazine, while also participating in marches for the cause."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A variety of factors can impact the sales of a video game, including regional preferences, marketing strategies, local events, competition with other game titles, and more.  The context given only provides limited information on the release dates and platforms but doesn't present any definitive data on the sales performance of the game. Additionally, the success of the game would depend on aspects such as the quality of the game, its reception among players, and any external factors.  In essence, whether Puss in Boots would have fared better if released in Europe first is inconclusive based on the provided context. A deeper analysis would be required, including looking at historical sales data and consumer behavior trends in both regions, understanding the competitive landscape, studying the marketing efforts, and assessing the timing of the release in relation to the movie.

Answer: The answer is:","output":"The tone of this product review can be considered as mixed, with both positive and negative aspects.  On the positive side, the reviewer explains how the product (a book or resource about the Rorschach inkblot test) was helpful in a specific situation. The reviewer states that they read the material years ago, which indicates that the information was memorable and useful even after a considerable amount of time. Additionally, they attribute their success in a psychological evaluation and custody battle, to a large extent, to the knowledge they gained from this product. This suggests that the product had a significant positive impact on their life, and they appreciated the benefits they derived from it. On the negative side, the reviewer comments on the circumstances in which they needed to use the product, which includes a court-ordered psychological evaluation and a conflict with their \\"insane ex-spouse.\\" This injects a sense of negativity or frustration into the review since the circumstances surrounding the usefulness of the product were challenging and undesirable. The mention of an ex-spouse being \\"great\\" uses sarcasm, which also adds to the negative tone. Moreover, the review itself contains language that is informal and somewhat unpolished, such as the use of \\"sort of\\" and the uncertainty about the spelling of \\"Rorschardt\\" (the correct spelling is Rorschach). The use of asterisks for emphasis and casual expressions like \\"BTW\\" (by the way) further contribute to a less formal tone. While this informal language does not necessarily indicate a negative tone, it can give a more casual or conversational feel to the review, which may not leave as strong of a positive impression as a more polished and professional review might. In conclusion, the tone of this product review can be seen as mixed, with both positive and negative aspects. Although the reviewer found the product to be helpful and life-changing, the circumstances surrounding its use and the informal language used in the review detract from a purely positive tone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Article:China's new \\"Elderly Rights Law\\" deals with the growing problem of lonely elderly people by ordering adult children to visit their ageing parents. The law says adults should care about their parents \\"spiritual needs\\" and \\"never neglect or snub elderly people\\". The regulation has been ridiculed by tens of thousands of Chinese web users. Many across China are questioning how the law could be enforced, since it fails to spell out a detailed schedule dictating the frequency with which children should make parental house calls. \\"Those who live far away from parents should go home often,\\" it says. However, that does not mean the law is toothless. Instead, it serves as an \\"educational message\\" to the public, while also serving as a starting point for law suits, explained Zhang Yan Feng, a lawyer with Beijing's King & Capital Law Firm. \\"It's hard to put this law into practice, but not impossible,\\" Mr Zhang explained. \\"If a case is brought to court on the basis of this law, I think it'll probably end up in a peaceful settlement. But if no settlement is reached, technically speaking, court rulings can force the person to visit home certain times a month.\\" \\"If this person disobeys court rulings, he could be fined or detained.\\" But few in China seem to fear they will end up behind bars if they fail to log visits home. \\"Who doesn't want to visit home often? What is considered \\"often\\"? Who will oversee the process?\\" complained one poster on weibo, China's version of Twitter. \\"We all know to cherish our elderly parents, but sometimes we are just too busy trying to make a living and the pressure is too much.\\" \\"It's fine that no-one is paying for us to visit our parents, but is there someone who can give us time off to do it?\\" asked another. The question of how to deal with ageing parents is a mounting problem in China. According to Chinese government statistics, more than 178 million people in China were 60 years or older in 2010. By 2030, that figure will double. As China's population goes grey, the Chinese media fills with stories of neglected old people. Many were shocked by the story of a 91-year-old grandmother who was beaten and forced out of her home in China's southern Jiangsu province after she asked her daughter-in-law for a bowl of rice porridge. Two days later, internet forums were filled with a similar story of farmers in the same province who allowed their family's 100-year-old matriarch to sleep in a pig sty, sharing close quarters with a pungent pig. But those stories have not lead most people to support the new Elderly Rights Law. \\"Family bonds should be based on spontaneous emotions,\\" argued one weibo user. \\"It's funny to make it part of a law; it's like requiring couples to have a harmonious sex life after marriage.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"China's new \\"Elderly Rights Law\\" addresses the issue of lonely elderly people by mandating adult children to visit their aging parents and care for their \\"spiritual needs.\\" The law has sparked debate, with many questioning how it can be enforced since it does not provide a detailed schedule for visits.

Choices:  - raise - make - reincarnate - repair - build  The rationale to choose \\"repair\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The rationale for choosing \\"repair\\" as the answer lies in understanding the context of the situation and the meanings of each choice provided.  - Raise: In this context, \\"raise\\" refers to the act of lifting or elevating something. This is not a suitable solution for the issue Wendy is facing, as Bob destroyed her toy, and Wendy possibly wants to fix it. - Make: To \\"make\\" something is to create or produce it from scratch. Choosing this option would mean Wendy believes she can make a new toy instead of the original one. However, the word \\"make\\" can have several other meanings and is not as specific a verb as \\"repair\\" is for fixing a broken item. - Reincarnate: This choice refers to the idea of bringing something back to life in a different form or body. While technically this could mean that Wendy believes she can bring the toy back in an alternative form, it is important to consider that Wendy might want her original toy to be as it was before it got destroyed, not a new version of it. Additionally, the concept of reincarnation is usually related to spiritual beliefs associated with living beings and not inanimate objects like toys. - Repair: In the given context, \\"repair\\" refers to the act of fixing, restoring, or mending something that has been damaged or broken. This is the most logical and appropriate choice for Wendy because it implies that she believes she has the ability or resources to fix her favorite toy that Bob destroyed. By repairing her toy, she can restore its original condition and continue to enjoy it. - Build: To \\"build\\" something means to construct or assemble it from parts or materials. While this choice might seem closely related to the concept of repairing, it leans more towards creating a new toy from various components, instead of fixing the original toy. Building a new toy would not be the same as bringing the broken toy back to its original state. Taking all these points into consideration, it is clear that \\"repair\\" is the most appropriate answer. By choosing \\"repair,\\" Wendy expresses her confidence in her ability to fix her favorite toy that was destroyed by Bob, ultimately restoring it to its original state and allowing her to continue enjoying it. This choice accurately addresses the issue at hand and is the most logical and relevant solution in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The electorate that just two years earlier had overwhelmingly voted for hope and change, sweeping Democrats into office, up and down the ballot, across the country, had buyers' remorse. America changed its mind after 2008 and broke hard for the tea party, building a wave that would devastate Democrats. At least that's the conventional lazy narrative about the 2010 midterm elections. That narrative draws a picture of a tea party wave that swept Republicans to victory on the back of a set of conservative policies in reaction to President Barack Obama and Democrats. Yes, Democrats have to persuade swing voters, but there isn't enough persuasion in the world to make up for a 17 percentage-point difference between Democratic base precincts and OPTIONS: - America base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Barack Obama base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Belcher base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - CNN base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Cornell Belcher base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Democratic base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Democrats base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Obama base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Republicans base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Senate base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. - Young base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone.","output":"- Republican base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. The right ending to the passage would be: \\"Yes, Democrats have to persuade swing voters, but there isn't enough persuasion in the world to make up for a 17 percentage-point difference between Democratic base precincts and Republican base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone.\\" This ending emphasizes the scale of the challenge the Democrats faced in the 2010 midterm elections, provides context for the electoral struggle between the two parties, and highlights the importance of understanding the implications of voting patterns in key states. Ultimately, it underscores the valuable insights provided by analyses that go beyond the \\"lazy\\" narrative of the 2010 elections as nothing more than a tea party surge.

Yes A:","output":"1). No A more detailed answer: The MLS (Major League Soccer) schedule works on a regular season and playoffs system. The regular soccer season typically begins in late February/early March and continues until early October. During this time, each team plays a total of 34 games – 17 home matches and 17 away matches – against other MLS teams. The league consists of two conferences - Eastern and Western. The conferences each have an equal number of teams, and the teams play a combination of matches within their conference and against teams from the other conference. At the end of the regular season, the top teams from each conference advance to the MLS Cup Playoffs.

Article: Federal Communication Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski pauses as he speaks at the Cable Show in Chicago, June 15, 2011.      WASHINGTON Julius Genachowski said on Friday he will step down as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in the coming weeks after four years on the job, and touted his record of working to expand broadband Internet service to Americans.      Genachowski, whose term was due to end in June, told FCC staffers he would be leaving his post \\"in the coming weeks\\" but did not give a date. He told Reuters after his announcement that he has no career plans lined up for after his FCC tenure ends.      \\"I'm still focused on the work of the agency,\\" Genachowski said, adding that he expects the FCC, which maintains a Democratic majority, to keep its policy direction after he leaves.      Asked to describe his tenure at the FCC in three words, Genachowski answered \\"unleashing broadband's benefits.\\"      His exit from the agency that oversees telecommunications and broadcast policies was widely expected after President Barack Obama's re-election. Obama will nominate a successor to Genachowski, who has headed the FCC since 2009.      In a statement, Obama praised Genachowski, the president's classmate at Harvard Law School, for giving the FCC a \\"clear focus\\" on encouraging innovation and competitiveness, attracting \\"jobs of tomorrow\\" and improving high-speed Internet access and mobile devices sector growth.      \\"I am grateful for his service and friendship, and I wish Julius the best of luck,\\" Obama said.      The FCC is also losing its senior Republican commissioner. Robert McDowell said on Wednesday he will depart his post in a few weeks, leaving the five-member panel with two Democrats, one Republican and two vacancies.      Among the possible candidates to head the FCC is Tom Wheeler, a venture capitalist and an Obama ally and fundraiser. Wheeler headed the National Cable Television Association and the wireless industry group CTIA.      Two other possible contenders are: Lawrence Strickling, head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which advises the president on telecommunications and information policy; and Karen Kornbluh, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international economic body.      The next FCC chief faces a list of projects to complete. One major one is Genachowski's plan for a complex incentive auction of spectrum that is meant to free up airwaves for better wireless Internet access.      The auction relies on TV stations to give up some of their airwaves to be auctioned off to wireless companies or opened up for shared use. The broadcasters would get a portion of the proceeds and the rest would pay for a public-safety program and go to the U.S. Treasury.      Also on the list is the delayed loosening of rules on media ownership.      Asked whether he would like to see a vote on those rules before he leaves the FCC, Genachowski said only that the commission will \\"continue to work on the agenda.\\"      Later this year, a federal court will also hold hearings in a case against Genachowski's net neutrality rules for Internet service providers that could have broad implications for the breadth of the FCC's regulatory power.      'AN UNEASY DANCE'      In his FCC tenure, Genachowski oversaw an overhaul of the multibillion-dollar Universal Service Fund from a project to spread telephone service in rural America to one focused on broadband access. He also spearheaded the creation of a strategy known as the National Broadband Plan and later pushed Internet providers to step up the speediness of their services.      The FCC's priorities under Genachowski reduced the influence of U.S. broadcasters, the relationship with whom has been \\"an uneasy dance,\\" according to Medley Global Advisors telecommunications policy analyst Jeffrey Silva.      Also left disappointed were liberal-leaning organizations including consumer interest groups. Harold Feld of advocacy group Public Knowledge said Genachowski is leaving more tasks for his successor to finish than most of his predecessors.      \\"It's true to some degree of every chairman, but this chairman in particular came in with a lot of expectations,\\" Feld said. \\"And then, as people say, he wrote a lot of checks that he's now leaving for the next chair to figure out how to cash.\\"      Genachowski, who charted a centrist course in his chairmanship, defended his tenure, which also included the FCC's rejection of a landmark 2011 merger bid between U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier AT&T; Inc and fourth-largest provider T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom. The bid was dropped after the Justice Department sued to block the deal.      In pushing against the merger, Genachowski stood up against the prospect of a duopoly in the wireless market by AT&T; and the largest carrier, Verizon, analysts say, as it retained T-Mobile as a competitor and protected the third-biggest player Sprint from being overwhelmed.      \\"This sector has always been and will always be characterized by a robust debate,\\" Genachowski said.      \\"Some people say the commission has gone too far, some people say the commission hasn't gone far enough. What we've been focused on are the right actions to drive the economy and to improve the lives of the American people.\\"      Genachowski came to the FCC after advising Obama on telecommunications policy and working at several tech investment firms. He had previously served as chief counsel for former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.

Usage: Given a sentence, classify an event in the sentence as either transient (it will change over time) or stationary (it will NOT change over time).

Example: Sentence: \\"He is hungry.\\" The question could be, \\"Will the person's hunger pass with time or will the person remain hungry forever?\\" It's a transient event since the person's hunger will change upon eating, so the correct answer would be that the hunger will pass with time. Part #3: Consider that the question has no single correct answer. Usage: When creating the question, make sure it has multiple possible answers.

Here is an article: This three-story brick house built in 1850 is set amid rolling green hills, 25 miles from Brussels in the French-speaking province of Walloon Brabant. It has four bedrooms and three baths; a recent renovation retained architectural elements like exposed oak ceiling beams and rafters, and even remnants of machinery, like the pulley above the living room framed by ceiling beams. The baths and kitchen have been redone, as have the electrical, water and heating systems. The house has about 7,600 square feet of space; the central living room has a 26-foot ceiling, opened up as part of the renovation, in which the owners removed two higher floors to reveal beams, braces and rafters, said Véronique Schatten, office manager for Engel & Voelkers Wavre, the listing agency. The room has three elongated south-facing windows, as well as three smaller windows on the opposite wall. A large stone fireplace set in a brick wall came from a chateau in France. Other rooms on the main floor include a small television lounge with an open mezzanine above that functions as a home office; an open kitchen; and an adjoining dining area with a terra-cotta-tiled floor. Kitchen cabinets are wooden; the stovetop is ceramic and appliances are by the German company Miele. Of three bedrooms on the second floor, two have en-suite baths with Grohe ceramic fixtures and white tile walls. On the third floor is the master suite, which has a dressing room in addition to the bath, and a pitched ceiling with exposed wood. The teak-paneled bath has a ceramic tub, a large tiled shower, and two porcelain sinks by the Italian company Antonio Lupi. In the basement is a brick-walled wine cellar with a lounge, which still has a round chunk of granite in the floor, a remnant of the mill’s machinery. Also included in the asking price are two 19th-century buildings with terra cotta roofs, one most likely a horse stable, the other a renovated one-story building that was intended to be a pool house. The pool was never built, so the building, equipped with a bar, a fireplace, French doors, and a terrace, is used for entertaining. Red beeches line the driveway leading to the main house. The lawns are dotted with chestnut and oak trees, trellised walkways and sculptured shrubs. The center of Brussels is 40 minutes away, an hour during rush hour. Walloon Brabant is in the “Green Belt,” a ring of suburbs and semirural areas around Brussels. Castles and monuments punctuate the countryside, among them the site of the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The market has been steady and strong, nearly unaffected by the crisis that crippled housing markets in countries like Ireland and Spain. According to Olivier Thiel, a residential investment specialist in the Brussels office of Knight Frank, a London real estate and consulting firm, “Almost everyone who is 30 years old has bought real estate, and they see it as a type of savings.” About 70 percent of Belgians own property, said Mr. Thiel, adding that property prices in Walloon Brabant had gone up an average of 50 percent over the past decade, and that higher-end properties had risen 16 percent over the last five years. Even so, Ms. Schatten says that properties priced above a million euros are not moving. In Walloon Brabant, a province of Wallonia, the transfer tax is around 14.5 percent of property value. Owners tend to keep properties a minimum of 10 years before selling, in order not to lose money on the purchase. “It’s kept it stable, slow,” Ms. Schatten said of the market. Nearly all buyers in Walloon Brabant are Belgian, typically young Brussels families seeking more space. The small number of foreigners who do buy in Walloon Brabant are generally residents of France, Britain, Holland and Scandinavian countries, and have children attending international schools in the area. There are no restrictions on foreign buyers. As in many European countries, buyers do not usually hire a lawyer, relying instead on the public notary to handle the transaction. But while there is no imperative to hire a lawyer, especially if the buyer is using a real estate agent, some factors may dictate retaining one, said Siegfried Busscher, a lawyer with the Brussels-based Schoups law firm. If there are international tax issues, he said, a lawyer should be consulted. Foreigners are eligible for mortgages from Belgian banks; they must meet the same requirements asked of any Belgian buyer. Brussels and Wallonia tourism: wallonie-tourisme.be/ French, Dutch and German; euro (1 euro = 1.28) The transfer tax and notary fee cost approximately 15 percent of the property’s value. The property tax is 1,679 a year.

Which language is this?","output":"The language provided in your prompt is Finnish. It belongs to the Finno-Ugric family of languages and is the official language of Finland. The sentence translates to \\"In short, we have many opportunities to increase interaction with Latin America.\\" The Finnish language is spoken by about 5 million people, most of whom reside in Finland.  Finnish is notable for its complex grammar and extensive use of vowel sounds. It is known for its consonant gradation—a grammatical feature relating to changes that occur in the pronunciation of consonants in certain phonetic environments—and its use of fifteen noun cases. Apart from Finland, it's also spoken in parts of Sweden, Norway, Russia, and Estonia, as well as by Finnish ex-pat communities in the United States, Canada, and throughout Europe.  The Finnish language has a beautiful and complex phonetic structure and is considered very expressive. The language is phonemic, which means that each letter corresponds to exactly one sound, thus making pronunciation simpler than in other languages. To learn Finnish, it's important to understand its unique characteristics and structure, which comprise a significant range of suffixes and a unique approach to expressing tense and mood through verb inflection.  In terms of writing, Finnish uses the Latin script, and like many European languages, it's written from left to right. The Finnish alphabet consists of 29 letters including 'a', 'ä', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'ö', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', and 'å'. The diacritical marks that appear above certain letters — 'ä' and 'ö'— signify a change in pronunciation.  Moreover, the Finnish language is notable for its rich and evocative vocabulary, with many unique words that do not have direct translations into other languages. For instance, the words 'sisu' (extreme determination and persistence) and 'löyly' (the steam that rises when water is thrown on the hot stones in a Finnish sauna) are unique to the Finnish language in their meaning. The overall structure and lexicon of the Finnish language provide a fascinating window into Finnish culture and way of thinking.  Finally, it's noteworthy that Finnish, like other languages, also has a variety of dialects and regional differences, where pronunciation, vocabulary, and even the grammar can vary a little from one area to another. This tends to be especially true in rural areas and among older generations, while standard Finnish is commonly used in urban areas and among younger Finns, and it's this version of the language that is typically taught to learners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - The Cape Canaveral Monsters is a 1960 science - fiction b - movie written and directed by Phil Tucker . Though intended as a theatrical feature , it was ultimately released directly to television .  - Phil Tucker (May 22, 1927  November 30, 1985) was an American film director, writer, producer, and film editor. While Tucker directed his first six feature films in the span of two years (while still in his mid-20s), he is best known for his first film, the science fiction B movie \\"Robot Monster\\", often considered an example of \\"so bad it's good\\" film-making in the Ed Wood vein, and for the Lenny Bruce movie \\"Dance Hall Racket\\".  - A B movie is a low-budget commercial movie that is not an arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified a film intended for distribution as the less-publicized, bottom half of a double feature. Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s, the term \\"B movie\\" continued to be used in the broader sense it maintains today. In its postGolden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.  - Dance Hall Racket is a 1953 American film directed by Phil Tucker starring Lenny Bruce (who also wrote the script) and his wife Honey Harlow.  - Leonard Alfred Schneider (October 13, 1925  August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name Lenny Bruce, was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, and screenwriter. He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an obscenity trial was followed by a posthumous pardon, the first in the history of New York state, by then-Governor George Pataki in 2003. He paved the way for future outspoken counterculture-era comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for freedom of speech in the United States.  - Robot Monster (a.k.a. Monster from Mars) is a 1953 independently made American black-and-white 3D science fiction film, produced and directed by Phil Tucker, written by Wyott Ordung, that stars George Nader, Claudia Barrett, and George Barrows. The production company was Three Dimension Pictures, Inc. The film was distributed by Astor Pictures.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'. The answer is:","output":"Subject: The Cape Canaveral Monsters, Robot Monster, Dance Hall Racket Object: science-fiction, B movie Justification: The user asked for the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.

Movie plot title: Call Northside 777 Movie plot: James Stewart in Call Northside 777 (1948) In Chicago in 1932, during Prohibition, a policeman is murdered inside a speakeasy. Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and another man are quickly arrested, and are later sentenced to serve 99 years' imprisonment each for the killing. Eleven years later, Wiecek's mother (Kasia Orzazewski) puts an ad in the newspaper offering a 5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer. This leads the city editor of the Chicago Times, Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb), to assign reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart) to look more closely into the case. McNeal is skeptical at first, believing Wiecek to be guilty. But he starts to change his mind, and meets increased resistance from the police and the state attorney's office, who are unwilling to be proved wrong. This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration. Eventually, Wiecek is proved innocent by, among other things, the enlarging of a photograph showing the date on a newspaper that proves that a key witness statement was false.

He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history. For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy. Eakins' first works upon his return from Europe included a large group of rowing scenes, eleven oils and watercolors in all, of which the first and most famous is Max Schmitt in a Single Scull (1871; also known as The Champion Single Sculling). Both his subject and his technique drew attention. His selection of a contemporary sport was \\"a shock to the artistic conventionalities of the city\\". Eakins placed himself in the painting, in a scull behind Schmitt, his name inscribed on the boat.  Typically, the work entailed critical observation of the painting's subject, as well as preparatory drawings of the figure and perspective plans of the scull in the water. Its preparation and composition indicates the importance of Eakins' academic training in Paris. It was a completely original conception, true to Eakins' firsthand experience, and an almost startlingly successful image for the artist, who had struggled with his first outdoor composition less than a year before. His first known sale was the watercolor The Sculler (1874). Most critics judged the rowing pictures successful and auspicious, but after the initial flourish, Eakins never revisited the subject of rowing and went on to other sports themes.  At the same time that he made these initial ventures into outdoor themes, Eakins produced a series of domestic Victorian interiors, often with his father, his sisters or friends as the subjects. Home Scene (1871), Elizabeth at the Piano (1875), The Chess Players (1876), and Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog (1874), each dark in tonality, focus on the unsentimental characterization of individuals adopting natural attitudes in their homes.  It was in this vein that in 1872 he painted his first large scale portrait, Kathrin, in which the subject, Kathrin Crowell, is seen in dim light, playing with a kitten. In 1874 Eakins and Crowell became engaged; they were still engaged five years later, when Crowell died of meningitis in 1879. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did the critics think of his early works?","output":"The critics thought that Thomas Eakins' early works, especially the rowing pictures, were successful and showed a lot of promise.

Firstly, it is essential to understand that this product is a DVD, presumably aimed at teaching certain moves – possibly dance, workout, or any other physical activity. The review acknowledges that the DVD is excellent for beginners, implying that the instructions are clear, easy to understand, and provide a good foundation for people new to the activity. For someone with limited experience or knowledge in the subject matter, this review could increase the chances of buying the product. Clear instructions and thorough explanations can be significantly beneficial for beginners, as they may not be familiar with the specific techniques or terminology involved in the activity. In this case, the product would serve as a reliable resource for learning the basics before moving on to more advanced levels. On the other hand, the reviewer mentions that there was too much explanation for their preference, which could be a valuable piece of information for someone with more experience or expertise in the specific activity. If the potential buyer has prior experience or is looking for a DVD that provides advanced techniques with minimal focus on foundational  or basic moves, this review could decrease the chances of them purchasing the product.  In conclusion, the impact of the given review on one's decision to buy the product largely depends on the individual's skill level and requirements. For a beginner seeking detailed guidance, the review might increase the chances of purchasing the DVD.

Remove the spaces from the following sentence: If you choose the annual payments option, you'll receive the Mega Millions Plus jackpot in 26 graduated annual payments.","output":"The task involves removing all the spaces from a given sentence. The sentence is: \\"If you choose the annual payments option, you'll receive the Mega Millions Plus jackpot in 26 graduated annual payments.\\" Spaces exist in a sentence to separate words and without them, the sentence can look quite different and possibly challenging to read, especially for those who are not programmed to read without spaces. In this case, and like English text in general, the spaces co-exist with punctuation marks such as commas and full stops. In this task, only the spaces between words are being removed, which means the punctuation marks will remain intact. To remove the spaces from this sentence, we'll take each word in succession and seamlessly join it to the next. Spaces tend to be situated after each word and before the following one, so removing them means that the tail of one word effectively meets the head of the next. The punctuation marks, as mentioned, divide sentences and phrases rather than individual words so they should remain untouched. Without further ado, here is the sentence \\"If you choose the annual payments option, you'll receive the Mega Millions Plus jackpot in 26 graduated annual payments.\\" with all spaces removed: \\"Ifyouchoosetheannualpaymentsoption,you'llreceivetheMegaMillionsPlusjackpotin26graduatedannualpayments.\\" As expected, without any spaces, the sentence becomes a long string of letters, punctuation, and numerals. It's challenging to read for a human being, but makes no difference for an AI as we don't rely on visual separation to understand text. Further confirmation is required to make certain that spaces between words are the only target in this limitation. It's also important to remember that despite it currently being difficult to read, the meaning of the sentence holds firm.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: With the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 suicide by drowning of Virginia Woolf in the River Ouse, the action takes place within the span of a single day in three different years and alternates between them throughout the film. In 1923, Virginia has begun writing the book Mrs Dalloway in her home in the town of Richmond outside London. In 1951, troubled Los Angeles housewife Laura Brown escapes from her conventional life by reading Mrs Dalloway. In 2001, New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character, as she spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with AIDS who is to receive a major literary award. Richard tells Clarissa he has stayed alive for her sake, and the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tells him she believes he would have won the award regardless of his illness. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" - her namesake - because she distracts herself from her own life the way the Woolf character does. Virginia, who has experienced several nervous breakdowns and suffers from bipolar disorder, feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, Leonard, who has begun a publishing business, Hogarth Press, at home to stay close to her. Virginia both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister Vanessa and her children. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London, when Leonard arrives to bring her home.

The name of which Spanish region means ?very hard??","output":"In order to answer the question, I need to first identify the Spanish regions and then determine which region's name means \\"very hard.\\"  Step 1: Identify the Spanish regions. There are 17 autonomous regions in Spain: Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Balearic Islands, Basque Country, Canary Islands, Cantabria, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y León, Catalonia, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Madrid, Murcia, Navarre, and Valencia. Step 2: Determine which region's name means \\"very hard.\\" In this case, none of the 17 autonomous regions in Spain are directly translated to \\"very hard.\\" However, this question might be about a historical region or a broader geographic area in Spain.  Extra step: Investigate the potential historical or geographic references that could mean \\"very hard.\\" After researching, I find that the name \\"Castilla,\\" a historical region in Spain, which now has been divided into two autonomous communities: Castilla-La Mancha and Castilla y León, is derived from the word \\"castillo,\\" which means \\"castle\\" in Spanish. The name represents the numerous castles that were built in the area during the Middle Ages. While \\"castle\\" could symbolically be considered \\"very hard\\" due to its structure and purpose, it's not a direct translation. Conclusion: None of the current 17 autonomous regions in Spain directly translate to \\"very hard.\\" However, the historical region of Castilla might be the closest one to that meaning, as it represents the many castles built in the area."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What type of pistol was  George Jackson accused of smuggling? Title: Black August Movie plot: Feature Description:The George Jackson story has now been developed into a movie entitled Black August. It depicts the last 14 months of George Jackson's existence under the subjective and objective conditions of captivity. Sentenced to one year-to-life at age 18, for a 70 gas station robbery in 1960, George Jackson would spend the next 11 years in California's industrial prison complex, 7 years of which were in solitary confinement. The movie encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The movie also reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities in America as well as their influence on prisoners across the country. George Jackson would be moved and inspired as a result of the Panther Party activities. As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, would be killed at the Marin County Courthouse, at San Raphael, California, during an alleged hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other Soledad Brothers. The younger Jackson and thre others would be killed, including Superior Judge, Harold Haley. and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at San Quentin State Prison, California, during what is discribed as a prison break attempt.

Here's a detailed and long answer explaining how to accomplish this goal using Option (a) - transforming a zipper-free hoodie into a t-shirt: 1. Gather your materials: To transform your zipper-free hoodie into a t-shirt, you will need some or all of the following materials: sharp fabric scissors or fabric shears, a fabric pen or chalk, pins, a sewing machine (with thread that matches your hoody), and an iron. 2. Prepare your workspace: Lay out your hoodie on a flat, clean, and well-lit surface, such as a table or the floor. Ensure that the hoodie is completely flat and wrinkle-free before you begin cutting. 3. Mark the cutting lines: Start by marking the cutting lines on your hoody using your fabric pen or chalk. To do this, lay a well-fitting t-shirt on top of your hoodie and align the shoulder seams. Trace the sleeve and collar lines of the t-shirt onto your hoody, ensuring your markings are symmetrical on both sides. If you prefer a wider or more relaxed fit for the sleeves and collar, you can draw those lines accordingly. 4. Cut the sleeves and collar: Using your sharp fabric scissors or fabric shears, carefully cut along the lines you've drawn to remove the sleeves and excess collar fabric. Ensure you cut as straight and accurately as possible. A poorly cut line can negatively impact the final appearance of your t-shirt. 5. Trim and neaten raw edges: To prevent fraying and give your t-shirt a polished look, fold over the raw edges of the sleeves and collar (approximately 1/4 - 1/2 inch) and pin them in place. If you're having difficulty keeping the fabric folded, press the folds with an iron to help them hold in place more securely. 6. Sew the hems: Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch around the pinned edges of the sleeves and collar to secure the folds and create a clean, finished hem. You can use a zigzag stitch if you prefer or if your fabric has some stretch, but remember to still sew close to the folded edge. 7. Remove pins and iron: After sewing, remove all pins and press the hems with an iron to give them a crisp, finished look. 8. Enjoy your new t-shirt: Your hoody has now been successfully transformed into a t-shirt. Enjoy wearing your newly created t-shirt and extend the life of your old hoodie by giving it a new purpose. If you have any remaining fabric, consider repurposing it to create patches, accessories such as hair scrunchies, or for other crafting projects.

TOM ROVER-- CONCLUSION  \\"And you got back all the bonds, Dick? How, splendid!\\"  It was Dora who uttered the words, shortly after the arrival at the Outlook Hotel of the three Rovers. Dick had had the japanned box under his arm, and now held it up in triumph.  \\"Yes, we've got them all back, and those that don't go to the bank as collateral security for a loan are going to a safe deposit box,\\" answered Dick. \\"I won't take any more chances with an office safe.\\"  \\"Especially not that office safe,\\" put in Sam, pointedly.  \\"And what are you going to do with Jesse Pelter?\\" questioned Nellie.  \\"We are going to put him where he belongs-- in prison,\\" answered Tom. And it may be as well to state here that in due course of time Jesse Pelter and his partner in crime, Grimes, alias Haywood, were tried and sentenced to long terms in prison. At this trial it was brought to light that Barton Pelter had known about the hole in the back of the safe, but had had absolutely nothing to do with the taking of the bonds. Jesse Pelter was very bitter against his nephew for exposing him, but the Rovers told the young man that he had done exactly right, and he said that he thought so, too.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash across northern Europe. Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer  of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava  from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

French art expert says Louvre's Leonardo was overcleaned One of France's most eminent art experts has criticised the Louvre Museum's cleaning of a 500-year-old Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece, The Virgin and Child With Saint Anne. Ségolène Bergeon Langle, former director of conservation for France's national museums, accuses the team involved with the restoration of removing details of Leonardo's original work by mistaking it for repaints by later hands. She criticises the removal of Leonardo's own glaze on the infant's body. A dozen letters she wrote \\"opposing the cleaning\\" and warning of damage to one of western art's jewels \\"remained unanswered\\", she said. Two of the experts on the international committee that advised on cleaning were specialists from the National Gallery in London, Larry Keith and Luke Syson. Bergeon Langle, an authority on art restoration, resigned from the committee, along with Jean-Pierre Cuzin, the Louvre's former head of paintings, last December. At the time neither would discuss their departure. Bergeon Langle said only: \\"My reasons I am reserving for a meeting with the president-director of the Louvre.\\" But this week, she gave an interview to a prestigious French publication, Le Journal des Arts. In January 2011, she said, the committee agreed \\"a gentle cleaning\\" of late varnishes and the removal of stains on the Virgin's cloak: \\"Yet, between July and October, a more pronounced clean was called 'necessary', which I objected to. I was then faced with opposition to my position, which is technical, not aesthetic.\\" Her letters to the committee asking for details on the cleaning and materials to be used for retouching went unanswered, she said. \\"I had to resign.\\" She believes the decision-makers behind the restoration were not cautious enough. \\"The Virgin's face is less modelled now. The cleaning should never have gone so far … The whitened layer on Christ Child's body has been mistakenly understood as a late varnish gone mouldy.\\" She believes it was an irreversibly [original] altered glaze: \\"I recommended preservation, but nobody would listen.\\" Considering that experts rarely speak out, her decision to go public is damning. It confirms the view of critics that the painting is left too bright and is robbed of the Renaissance master's subtlety. As the Guardian reported last year, a Louvre source revealed that Keith and Syson were particularly keen on this restoration. Michel Favre-Félix, president of the Association for the Respect and Integrity of Artistic Heritage in Paris, was among those alarmed by the cleaning procedures. He is now collating a dossier of evidence, challenging the restoration on \\"points of gross misconduct\\". He said: \\"We are calling for the establishment of a scientific ethics committee, independent from the museums and the restoration teams, just as there is for medicine. It should re-examine the whole Saint Anne file.\\" Michael Daley, director of ArtWatch UK, the restoration watchdog, said he was shocked to learn that Bergeon Langle's warnings had been ignored: \\"It suggests either that describing what they planned would be dangerous and embarrassing or that they weren't clear what they intended to do. Either way, it's unacceptable.\\" The criticisms resonated with another member of the Louvre's advisory committee, Jacques Franck, consulting expert to the Armand Hammer Centre for Leonardo studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. He told the Guardian: \\"Restorations likely to generate such disapproval from leading experts should never be undertaken … Bergeon Langle is unquestionably France's best authority.\\" Asked to comment on whether other Leonardo paintings in the Louvre should be cleaned, Bergeon Langle gasped in horror: \\"Just do not do it!\\" The Louvre and the National Gallery declined to comment. • This article was amended on 30 April 2012. The original said that Ségolène Bergeon Langle criticised the retouching on the landscape in the painting and that she believed the restorers were not cautious enough. These points have been corrected. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A famous art expert in France, Ségolène Bergeon Langle, thinks that the Louvre Museum cleaned a very old painting by Leonardo da Vinci too much.

Pro-independence rallies being held in Glasgow and other cities to mark the anniversary of the 2014 vote. Meanwhile pro-Union supporters are marking the occasion by calling for a second referendum to be ruled out. The SNP has launched a \\"new conversation\\" on independence in the wake of the Brexit vote, but opposition parties have urged them to \\"focus on the day job\\" of governing Scotland. A rally of independence supporters is being held at Glasgow Green, with live music and speakers including SNP MP and deputy leadership candidate Tommy Sheppard. Meanwhile actress Elaine C Smith is hosting a meeting of the \\"Scottish Independence Convention\\" in Glasgow, with speakers including MSPs Jeane Freeman and Ross Greer. Other events are taking place elsewhere in Glasgow, Oban and Inverness, and a rally is also planned for Edinburgh later in the week. On 18 September 2014, more than 3.6 million Scots - a record 84.59% of the electorate - turned out to vote on the question \\"should Scotland be an independent country\\". A total of 2,001,926 people voted No, while 1,617,989 voted Yes. Most of the major parties have changed leaders since then, with Nicola Sturgeon replacing Alex Salmond as first minister and Theresa May taking over from David Cameron in Downing Street, while there have been UK and Scottish parliamentary elections and a referendum on the EU. Ms Sturgeon has claimed that the UK Scotland voted to remain part of \\"no longer exists\\", arguing that Scots have the right to consider a second poll in light of the EU referendum in June, which saw the majority of Scots who turned out backing Remain, while the UK as a whole voted to leave. Writing in the Sunday Herald newspaper to mark the anniversary, the SNP leader said self-governance was more important than \\"oil, national wealth and balance sheets\\". Ms Sturgeon said: \\"The EU referendum and the myriad of uncertainties it has thrown up in terms of the path ahead for both Scotland and the rest of the UK have of course provided a new ingredient to the debate on Scotland's future. \\"But two years on from the historic vote of 2014, the fundamental case for Scotland's independence remains as it was. The case for full self-government ultimately transcends the issues of Brexit, of oil, of national wealth and balance sheets and of passing political fads and trends. \\"It is in essence, as the Yes campaign said two years ago, about the simple fundamental truth that the big decisions about Scotland - including the decision about our EU membership - should be taken by those who live and work here. That is a truth which endures.\\" Mr Salmond meanwhile predicted his successor would call a second poll in 2018. And the Scottish Greens said they would launch a fresh campaign to convince former No voters to back independence by having others who changed their minds explain their reasons. A party spokesman said: \\"In light of the 2015 election, the prospect of decades more Tory government or the results of this year's Brexit vote many have reconsidered their choice and many more are thinking of doing the same. This campaign is about giving these voters a platform to tell their stories.\\" Former Better Together campaigners have also been marking the event. The Scottish Conservatives have set up a number of street stalls across Scotland calling for the country to \\"move forward\\" instead of focusing on independence. Leader Ruth Davidson said Ms Sturgeon's latest quotes showed she was \\"abandoning\\" her 2014 arguments. She said: \\"The economic case for independence two years ago was a tissue of lies. Fantasy figures on oil and our national wealth concocted to fool people and which fell apart under scrutiny. \\"Now everyone can see Nicola Sturgeon's sums don't add up, she's decided to abandon them altogether. \\"Instead of trying to explain what would happen to our economy and how we fund our public services under independence, the new mantra is that none of these things matter anymore and people should just shut up about them and wrap themselves in a flag instead. \\"I think Scots are smart enough to draw their own conclusions.\\" Meanwhile, Ms Davidson's finance and economy spokesmen Murdo Fraser and Dean Lockhart have written to Ms Sturgeon urging her to rule out a second referendum, calling it a \\"ball and chain\\" on the country's economy. They said Ms Sturgeon \\"could provide no greater stimulus to the Scottish economy than to clarify that no referendum will take place\\". Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said the SNP should \\"renew its focus on the day job\\". She said: \\"Since 2014 the economic arguments for Scotland staying in the UK, the positive benefits we get from pooling and sharing resources, have become stronger. \\"With so many challenges facing Scotland's future it makes no sense to return to the arguments of our past. \\"Instead there should be a renewed focus on the day job from the SNP government. We need to see real progress on the bread and butter issues which touch the lives of families across Scotland. \\"Scotland's voice was heard in 2014 and Nicola Sturgeon needs to listen to it.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, speaking at his party's federal conference in Brighton, accused former Prime Minister David Cameron of putting \\"the future of the union\\" at risk by focusing on English nationalism after the vote. He said: \\"Instead of reaching out to Scotland, he used his speech in the morning of the Scottish referendum result to stoke up English nationalism by arbitrarily stripping Scottish MPs of voting rights. \\"He put all our work during the referendum at risk. I am glad he has gone. David Cameron doesn't deserve our respect or fond memory.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"In 2014, people in Scotland voted to decide if their country should be independent or not. Many people discussed this important decision, and in the end, 55% of them decided that Scotland should stay with the United Kingdom (UK). However, some people still believe that Scotland should be an independent country. They are having meetings and events to support this idea. Scotland's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, says that big decisions about the country should be made by the people who live there. Other leaders believe that being a part of the UK is better for Scotland's money and jobs. They think that having another vote on this issue will not help their economy grow and that people should think about the future instead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As millions of playthings are recalled, doctors are reminded that the risks of lead exposure continue for young patients. Lead is such a well-known health - perhaps even contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire- that it came as a shock to discover that toys played by children could contain lead. Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora. Millions of others toys, lunch boxes and pieces of jewelry manufactured in China have been recalled because they contain lead either in the paint that coats them or as a component of the plastic used to make the item more flexible. The lead content in some of the toys recalled this summer was 180 times the amount allowed by law. Some pieces of jewelry were almost 100% lead. Experts advise that the items do cause a risk and that doctors should urge parents to check the comprehensive lists of recalled products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and return any appearing on those lists to the manufacturers. If exposure is suspected, a blood test is in order . Since there is no safe level of this universal   element, the risk face by children for lead poisoning and its accompanying threat of learning disabilities and behavior problems is considerable. Doctors who have toys in their waiting rooms also are advised to see if any of them have been recalled and to check for chipped, flaking paint-even on those that haven't yet been recalled--since new announcements of toy risk continue. Question: What is Dora according to the passage? Answer: A:","output":"Dora, according to the passage, is a toy played by children that has been found to contain lead.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 - 25 February 2001), often referred to as \\"The Don\\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Bradman joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. The RAAF had more recruits than it could equip and train and Bradman spent four months in Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.  Invalided out of service in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed stockbroking during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.  In June 1945, Bradman faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.  However, the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing Bradman as their delegate to the Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside some of the men he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test selector, and played a major role in planning for post-war cricket. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was wrong with him?","output":"Sir Donald Bradman, who is known to be the greatest batsman of all time, suffered from significant physical health issues during his life. According to your provided information, Bradman's muscular problems, which were diagnosed as fibrositis, were so severe that they eventually got him invalided out of service in June 1941. These chronic muscular problems were so severe that Bradman was unable even to shave or comb his hair due to the extensive muscular pain.  In addition to his physical muscular issues, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight. This was surprising given his extraordinary skills as a batsman. Furthermore, due to his health conditions, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his dominant right hand. This was after being referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders in 1945. Bradman, according to Charles Williams in his biography, might have also suffered from psychosomatic problems which could have been induced by stress and possibly depression. This theory was not disputed by Bradman himself when he read the manuscript of the biography.

Q:Given the following context:  White Deer Hole Creek is a 20.5-mile (33.0 km) tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Clinton, Lycoming and Union counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. A part of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, the White Deer Hole Creek watershed drains parts of ten townships. The creek flows east in a valley of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians, through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods. As of 2006, the creek and its 67.2-square-mile (174 km2) watershed are relatively undeveloped, with 28.4 percent of the watershed given to agriculture and 71.6 percent covered by forest, including part of Tiadaghton State Forest. The western part of White Deer Hole Creek has very high water quality and is the only major creek section in Lycoming County classified as Class A Wild Trout Waters, defined by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as \\"streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery.\\" The rest of the creek and its major tributary (Spring Creek) are kept stocked. There are opportunities in the watershed for canoeing, hunting, and camping, and trails for hiking and horseback riding. Historically, two paths of the native indigenous peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, was built in the watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two unincorporated villages, a hamlet, and most of the farms (many Amish).  answer the following question:  What was the acronym for the type of plant that was built in the watershed and later became a federal prison?

The answer is:","output":"What does the term \\"BASE\\" in BASE jumping stand for and what are the elements that it encompasses? As per the provided answer, the term \\"BASE\\" in BASE jumping is an acronym that represents four categories of fixed objects from which an individual can jump. Let’s discuss each letter of the acronym: 1. Buildings: This includes any man-made structures such as skyscrapers, towers, etc. The jumper often ascends these structures in a variety of ways - by elevator, stairs, or sometimes even climbing - before making the leap. 2. Antennas: This refers to transmission towers or masts. Like buildings, these are also man-made structures but they typically have a different architecture, often being more slim and tall. 3. Spans: This term refers to bridges. The space beneath the bridge provides an unobstructed area which allows the jumper to achieve freefall. Unlike buildings and antennas, this category also includes natural arches. 4. Earth: This signifies natural landforms, primarily cliffs or mountainous areas. The terrain on these landforms can often be rugged or steep which adds another layer of thrill and risk to the jump. These jumps often require more technical skills due to the varying conditions and potential for unpredictable winds. BASE jumping is essentially parachuting or wingsuit flying from these fixed, high points. It's worth noting that because of the altitudes involved and the proximity to the structure during the jump, it’s considered a very high-risk activity. This sport demands not just physical readiness, but also mental preparedness and the mastering of safety protocols and techniques. Despite the risk involved, many adrenaline junkies are drawn to this extreme sport due to the thrill and exhilaration that comes with it."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running.  But I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate.

The distinguishing feature of vertebrates is the presence of a vertebral column or a backbone, made up of individual vertebrae, which provides structural support and protection to the spinal cord. To clarify further, the term \\"vertebrates\\" refers to animals belonging to the subphylum Vertebrata of the phylum Chordata, which includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. The most notable characteristic shared by all vertebrates is the presence of this vertebral column. Other traits shared among vertebrates include a well-developed nervous system, a closed circulatory system, and, indeed, the presence of jaws in most (but not all) vertebrates. While fat is a common feature among vertebrates, it does not solely define the group, and there might be exceptions depending on the species or specific circumstances (e.g., food scarcity). Similarly, jaws are present in most vertebrates but are not a defining characteristic for all. For example, jawless fish like hagfish and lampreys are considered vertebrates but lack jaws.

After another pilot, Slick Goodlin, demands 150,000 to attempt to break the sound barrier, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot Jack Ridley.

Q: What effect, related to weather forecasting, occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer and the source?   A: A:","output":"The effect related to weather forecasting that occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer and the source is known as the Doppler Effect (IV).  The Doppler Effect, named after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave relative to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. This phenomenon can be observed in various waves, such as sound, light, and electromagnetic waves.  In the context of weather forecasting, the Doppler Effect is particularly significant for meteorologists who use a technology called Doppler radar to measure the velocity and direction of atmospheric phenomena such as precipitation, wind, and storms. A Doppler radar sends out waves, usually in the form of radio or microwaves, which then bounce off objects in the atmosphere, such as raindrops or snowflakes, and return to the radar receiver. By analyzing the frequency change in the reflected waves, meteorologists can determine the motion of the objects, allowing them to make more accurate predictions regarding weather patterns and potential hazards like tornadoes and flash floods. In summary, the Doppler Effect (IV) is the weather forecasting-related phenomenon that occurs with any wave, including sound, when there is relative motion between the observer and the wave source. This effect is a crucial aspect of modern meteorology, enabling accurate and timely predictions of weather events using advanced technologies like Doppler radar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thomas decided to eat some shellfish, and a short while later he felt like his throat was closing up and it was becoming difficult to breathe.  and a hint : Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune system’s response.  Please answer this question : Who is less likely to be experiencing mild allergy symptoms? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information and comparing the symptoms between Jonathan and Thomas, it appears that Thomas is less likely to be experiencing mild allergy symptoms. Jonathan's symptoms include watery and itchy eyes, along with constant sneezing. These symptoms are quite typical of mild allergic reactions, particularly during spring when there is a high amount of pollen in the air. Pollen allergies are a common type of seasonal allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever. In Jonathan's case, his immune system is overreacting to the pollen as if it is a harmful invader, triggering the release of histamine which causes the mild allergy symptoms he is experiencing. These symptoms can often be managed with over-the-counter antihistamines or other allergy medications. In contrast, Thomas' symptoms appear to be more severe. After eating shellfish at a seafood dinner, he experienced difficulty breathing as if his throat was closing up. These symptoms suggest that Thomas is experiencing a more serious allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening and severe allergic reaction which requires immediate medical attention and treatment with epinephrine, a hormone that helps open the airways and improve blood circulation. Symptoms like difficulty breathing and throat constriction can be potentially life-threatening and are generally not considered mild allergy symptoms. In conclusion, based on the symptoms experienced by both Jonathan and Thomas, it is more likely that Jonathan is experiencing mild allergy symptoms while Thomas is experiencing a more severe allergic reaction. It is crucial for Thomas to receive appropriate medical intervention to address his potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, whereas Jonathan can typically manage his symptoms by using antihistamines or other allergy medications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"Title: Needs Improvement - Potential But Falls Short (2/5) Review: I recently downloaded the app with package com.google.zxing.client.android after hearing a lot about its barcode scanning capabilities. While I had high hopes for its performance and ease of use, I must say that it currently stands at two stars for me, with five being the highest possible rating. There is certainly potential for a truly useful and efficient app, but the current version falls short in several areas. Firstly, let's talk about the user interface. The design is basic and somewhat outdated, giving a dull overall impression. Inputs and buttons can be unresponsive at times, causing unnecessary delays when setting up scans and processing the data. I believe that a more streamlined and modern interface is essential for an optimal user experience. Secondly, the app's actual barcode scanning capability has left me feeling underwhelmed. While it does manage to scan barcodes eventually, the process can often be finicky and frustrating. The scanner sometimes has issues focusing on the barcode, requiring multiple attempts and angle adjustments before it's finally successful. This can defeat the purpose of having a quick and convenient method of scanning barcodes. Improving the scanning accuracy and efficiency should be a top priority for the developers. Additionally, the app's performance issues could use some attention. It tends to freeze or crash frequently, especially when processing large amounts of barcode information. This can be extremely inconvenient and leads to users having to restart the app or even their device. The developers need to focus on optimizing the app's performance and reducing the number of crashes and freezes. Moreover, the app is lacking in terms of features. While barcode scanning is the main selling point, it would be beneficial to expand the app's functionality. For instance, adding a price comparison tool could prove to be a valuable addition that would keep users engaged and recommend the app to their friends and connections. Lastly, the customer support for this app is mediocre at best. The response time to user inquiries and feedback is slow, and the solutions provided to technical issues are often unhelpful. Better customer support could drastically improve the app's overall appeal and reputation. In conclusion, the app with package com.google.zxing.client.android has potential, but it currently falls short in various departments: user-interface, scanning performance, app stability, additional features, and customer support. To rate it higher, I would need to see significant improvements made to address these shortcomings.

Write the next sentence. Emily bought their groceries from the famer's market instead of the local store like Tanya, because","output":"she firmly believed in the numerous benefits of supporting local farmers and consuming fresh, organic produce. By choosing the farmer's market, Emily knew that she was not only reducing her carbon footprint and contributing to a sustainable local economy, but also ensuring that the food she brought home was packed with nutrients and devoid of harmful chemicals often found in mass-produced goods. Tanya, on the other hand, was more focused on the convenience and affordability that the local store offered. She hadn't yet delved into the vast implications of choosing between these two options, and simply followed her usual routine. While she was aware that Emily frequented the farmer's market, she didn't quite understand Emily's motivations nor the underlying reasons that propelled her to do so. Emily, who had taken numerous steps over the years to educate herself about the importance of food sourcing, environmental conservation, and local economies, regularly shared her knowledge with others, hoping to make a positive impact by raising awareness. She took great care in selecting her grocery items, oftentimes asking the farmers themselves about their cultivation methods and the types of seeds they used, as a means to ensure that her choices aligned with her values. Furthermore, she found that the quality and taste of the produce she purchased at the farmer's market far surpassed what she could find at the chain supermarkets. The locally-grown fruits and vegetables were picked at the peak of ripeness, allowing their flavors to fully develop before consumption. This made her meals not only healthier, but more enjoyable as well. In addition to supporting local farmers, Emily also appreciated the sense of community that the farmer's market fostered. Conversations and friendships bloomed between vendors and customers, creating an atmosphere that was both lively and welcoming. Emily enjoyed the opportunity to engage in meaningful exchanges, learn new recipes, and discover novel products that she would have unlikely stumbled upon in a conventional grocery store. Despite Emily's insistence on the importance of purchasing groceries from the farmer's market, Tanya remained hesitant. That is, until one sunny Saturday morning, when Emily decided to invite her friend along to experience first-hand the vibrant world of fresh, locally-sourced produce. Tanya, who had never before set foot in a farmer's market, soon found herself drawn to the enticing sights, the alluring smells of freshly baked bread, and the cheerful sounds of laughter and good-natured bargaining. As they strolled from stall to stall, Emily shared her insights garnered over the years. She explained the significance of each choice she made, and by extension, how those choices directly impacted local farms and the larger community. Tanya soon began to comprehend the importance of promoting sustainable practices and supporting the livelihoods of those who worked hard to supply fresh, nutritious food. That pivotal day marked a turning point in Tanya's perspective, as she realized that there was much more at stake when it came to something as seemingly simple as grocery shopping. From that moment on, she slowly began incorporating more locally-sourced items in her food choices, and started attending the farmer's market with Emily on a regular basis. Together, they continued to make a difference in their local community and beyond, one farm-fresh tomato at a time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In fact , we ' ve found that , for ourselves , trying to do it any other way is actually counter - productive to our desired end . Part of our simplicity quest is to reduce stress . When we push ourselves too far outside of our comfort zone , or make decisions too hastily , we get stressed . Answer the following question: What happens when the narrator becomes stressed ?","output":"When the narrator becomes stressed, various psychological, emotional, and physical reactions occur, affecting their overall well-being, productivity, and interpersonal relationships. These reactions can be broadly categorized into the following: 1. Psychological effects: The narrator's cognitive abilities may be compromised due to stress. They may experience difficulties concentrating, problem-solving, and making sound decisions. Additionally, memory recall and information retention might become challenging. Over time, the narrator may develop negative thought patterns, self-doubt, and a sense of vulnerability, which can adversely impact their self-esteem and overall mental health. 2. Emotional effects: Stress can lead to a wide range of emotional responses in the narrator, such as feelings of anxiety, irritability, frustration, and sadness. They may also become more prone to mood swings and emotional outbursts, which can strain their personal and professional relationships. In severe cases, chronic stress can contribute to the onset of depression and other mental health disorders. 3. Physical effects: The narrator's body may exhibit physical symptoms in response to stress. Some common physical manifestations of stress include headaches, muscle tension, fatigue, digestive issues, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns. When stress is prolonged or becomes chronic, the narrator may be more vulnerable to developing severe health issues, such as cardiovascular diseases, weakened immune systems, and a greater susceptibility to illnesses or infections. 4. Behavioral effects: Stress can also influence the narrator's overall behavior and habits. They may struggle to maintain a proper work-life balance, leading to reduced productivity and procrastination. Additionally, stress can spur unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as substance abuse, overeating, or social withdrawal. Over time, these behaviors can compound stress levels and adversely impact various aspects of the narrator's life, including their career, relationships, and personal well-being. 5. Impact on personal and professional relationships: As the narrator becomes more stressed, their ability to maintain healthy, functional relationships may decline. The increased irritability, emotional outbursts, and mood swings can strain connections with friends, family, and coworkers. In turn, a deteriorating support system can amplify feelings of stress and isolation, creating a vicious cycle. In summary, when the narrator becomes stressed, a cascade of psychological, emotional, physical, and behavioral effects ensue. These reactions can negatively impact their mental and physical health, productivity, decision-making abilities, and relationships with others. Addressing and managing their stress should be a priority for the narrator, as unchecked stress can lead to chronic health problems and diminished overall well-being. By finding coping strategies and maintaining a balanced approach to life, the narrator can potentially reduce counter-productive stress and foster a healthier, more fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009.  In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s.  In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they ever search the Potomac River for it?","output":"The article does not specifically mention that they searched the Potomac River for Hattie McDaniel's Oscar.

Given those answer options, answer the question: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July.  Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

In the week since Manny Pacquiao dominated and dismantled Chris Algieri over 12 lop-sided rounds in Macau, the clamour for him to fight Floyd Mayweather Jnr has reached unprecedented levels. Pacquiao stoked the flames by dutifully calling out Mayweather to anyone who would listen and his promoter Bob Arum quickly followed suit, as he had done with gusto in the build up. The WBC, whose welterweight and light-middleweight titles Mayweather holds, then claimed they will do whatever they can to make the fight despite having ranked the pair as No 1 and No 2 for the last year without installing Pacquiao as Mayweather's mandatory challenger.

He realized that a victory over Pacquiao would solidify his place in boxing history as one of the best ever. Behind the scenes, negotiations started to take place. Both Mayweather and Pacquiao were eager to make the fight happen, and after months of back-and-forth discussions, a compromise was reached. As part of the deal, Bob Arum agreed to take a step back, allowing Mayweather to work with another promoter to make the fight happen. On a historic night, both fighters entered the ring with the support of millions of fans watching around the world. The atmosphere was electric, and the tension could be felt in the air. Everyone knew that they were about to witness a once-in-a-lifetime event. The fight began with both fighters showcasing their skills and displaying their tactical prowess. Mayweather's defensive expertise made it difficult for Pacquiao to land any significant punches, while Mayweather's counter-punching ability allowed him to catch Pacquiao whenever he got too aggressive. On the other hand, Pacquiao managed to apply constant pressure, keeping Mayweather on his toes and demonstrating his trademark speed and power. As the rounds went on, the fight remained close and extremely competitive. Both fighters continued to push themselves, each knowing that the slightest mistake could cost them their legacy. In the end, it came down to the final round. With both fighters battered and bruised, they gave it their all in an unforgettable display of heart and skill.

Mayweather and Pacquiao both gained newfound respect for each other, and after the fight, they exchanged words of admiration and gratitude for the opportunity to share the ring. In an unexpected turn of events, Mayweather expressed his interest in promoting and supporting a rematch, willing to overlook his past issues with Bob Arum. Both fighters, with nothing left to prove, acknowledged the possibility of a future rematch but also contemplated retirement.

Answer: Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choose from: [I] yes [II] no","output":"[I] Yes. The initial state of Earth was a hot, molten mass, formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago. The planet came into being as a result of the process of accretion, wherein dust and gas in the early solar system clumped together to form larger bodies, ultimately leading to the birth of Earth and other planets. In its infancy, Earth was extremely hot due to residual heat from the accretion process, as well as radioactive decay of isotopes and intense volcanism. The planet underwent frequent collisions with other celestial bodies, including a particularly massive impactor known as Theia. This catastrophic collision is believed to have played a crucial role in the formation of the Moon as debris from both Earth and Theia merged together under the influence of gravity. During this molten, chaotic period, heavy elements, such as iron and nickel, sank to form the planet's core, while lighter elements, such as silicates, rose to form the mantle and crust, setting the stage for the process of differentiation that defined Earth's layered internal structure. Early on, Earth's atmosphere was composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, but constant volcanic activity and the release of gases from the planet's interior led to a chemical transformation of the atmosphere to one dominated by water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and other trace gases. Over time, as the planet slowly cooled, the outer layers of the molten Earth began to solidify, eventually forming a thin, fragile crust. The bombardment of comets and asteroids provided Earth with water, which eventually filled the planet's basins, creating the first oceans. Life on Earth is thought to have originated in these early oceans, around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, as simple single-celled organisms. Thus, the initial state of Earth was an extremely hot and molten mass, characterized by extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other celestial bodies.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu.  answer the following question:  Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I? Answer:","output":"The woman married to Maximilian I is Mary of Burgundy. Her grandfather, as per the provided context, is Philip the Good. So, the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I is Philip the Good.  The reasoning behind this answer is that according to the given context, the Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed on to several family members, including \\"his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I.\\" The last male named before this part of the sentence is Philip the Good, which means Philip is the \\"his\\" referred to here and, therefore, Mary's grandfather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Buccal testosterone is taken orally through a lozenge. The lozenge dissolves in your mouth.","output":"This method of administration allows for the testosterone to be absorbed directly into your bloodstream through the mucous membranes of your mouth, bypassing the digestive system and liver, which can sometimes cause unwanted side effects or reduce the effectiveness of the hormone. Buccal testosterone also offers a more consistent and steady release of the hormone into the body, providing better therapeutic results for those seeking to treat low testosterone levels or transition to a male physical appearance. To use buccal testosterone, you will usually be prescribed a specific dosage by your healthcare provider, who will take into account your particular needs and medical history. Generally, it's advised to place the lozenge between your cheek and gum, allowing it to dissolve slowly over a period of approximately 30 minutes.  During this time, it's crucial not to chew, swallow or disrupt the lozenge in any way, as this will impact the absorption of testosterone into your system. It's also advisable to avoid consuming food, beverages, or indulging in activities like smoking while the lozenge is dissolving. Many users prefer to take their dose either in the early morning or right before bed to minimize discomfort or the potential for interference with daily tasks. Additionally, be sure to practice good oral hygiene, as buccal testosterone can occasionally contribute to gum irritation or other oral health issues if proper care is not taken.  As with any hormone therapy, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions closely and attend regular checkups to monitor your progress, ensure the correct dosage is being utilized, and address any questions or concerns that may arise. Some potential side effects of buccal testosterone include: gum or mouth irritation, a bitter taste in the mouth, headache, and mood swings. If you experience any of these symptoms or notice other changes in your body or mood, contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may adjust your dosage or recommend an alternative method of testosterone administration that better suits your needs.  Remember that testosterone therapy should only be undertaken when prescribed by a qualified medical professional, as misusing or abusing it can lead to a wide range of health issues. It's crucial to work closely with your doctor to determine if buccal testosterone is right for you and to establish an appropriate treatment plan to address your unique needs and goals. In conclusion, if you're considering taking testosterone, buccal administration is an effective and convenient option that may provide the results you're searching for while minimizing the potential for side effects.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the song that won three Grammy awards by the band that had an album reach number one in 30 countries?  Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally. For the album's release, U2 partnered with Apple for several cross-promotions: the first single, \\"Vertigo\\", was featured in a television advertisement for the company's iPod music player, while a U2-branded iPod and digital box set exclusive to the iTunes Store were released. \\"Vertigo\\" was an international hit, topping the charts in Ireland and the UK, while reaching number two in Canada, number five in Australia, and number 31 in the US. The song won three Grammy Awards, including one for Best Rock Song. Other singles from the album were also hits; \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\", written as a tribute to Bono's late father, went to number one in the UK and Canada, while \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" reached number two in both regions.

Here is an article: OAKLAND, Calif. – Californians may have rejected legalizing recreational marijuana, but voters across the state are more than ready to reap revenue from the state's largest cash crop. On Election Day, all 10 cities with local measures on their ballots approved new or higher taxes on marijuana sales that put the need for cash above the stigma of a federally banned drug. The same was true in Colorado, where medical marijuana was approved in 2000. Nine municipalities approved higher sales taxes on medical marijuana products this year. So far, no Colorado town with a marijuana tax question on the ballots has rejected it. The embrace of pot as a legitimate revenue stream signals the continued mainstreaming of marijuana in both states, despite the defeat of California's Proposition 19. \\"As part of treating this business like any other business in the city, we need to update our business operation tax to include them,\\" said Amy Williams, a spokeswoman for the City of Sacramento, where voters approved a 4 percent tax on medical pot. Other cities that approved special marijuana taxes, including San Jose, Long Beach and Oakland, have all struggled with recession-driven deficits, and all decided to look to marijuana to bridge the gap. Some cities put measures on the ballot to prepare themselves in case voters approved Proposition 19, which included a provision that would have legalized small-scale cultivation of marijuana across the state. Long Beach's measure, which passed overwhelmingly, would have imposed a 15 percent tax on businesses that sold marijuana for recreational use. Voters in Stockton imposed a 4 percent tax on medical marijuana dispensaries. The same measure would have levied a 10 percent tax on non-medical marijuana businesses. Oakland voters led the way last year by passing the country's first special tax on medical marijuana, an extra 18 for every 1,000 in sales on top of the city's regular sales tax of 9.75 percent. In the most recent election, voters raised that tax rate to 50 for every 1,000. And the city is poised to lead again in pushing the limits of government-sanctioned pot sales. Later this month, the city will begin taking applications for permits to run four industrial-scale medical marijuana growing operations. Nearly 300 groups and individuals have registered their interest in applying for the permits. Each would have to pay a 5,000 nonrefundable fee to apply. Recipients of the permits would be required to pay an annual fee of 211,000. The decision to tax the drug in a way that resembles special taxes on recreational substances like alcohol and tobacco moves the state even closer to acknowledging openly that marijuana being sold legally under state law is \\"medical\\" in name only. Currently, tobacco distributors in California must pay 87 cents in taxes per pack of cigarettes and a tax rate of more than 33 percent for other tobacco products. Beer and wine are taxed at a rate of 20 cents per gallon. Hard liquor taxes are 3.30 per gallon for spirits less than 100 proof and 6.60 per gallon for over 100 proof. Medical marijuana advocates are frustrated by the comparison to other mood-altering substances. They believe that what they see as the drug's broad therapeutic properties should put pot in the same category as prescription medications, which are not taxed. They also believe that not granting the drug the respect they think it deserves as medicine has led to crackdowns in other California cities less enthusiastic about embracing marijuana as a revenue source. Recent regulations have forced many dispensaries in Los Angeles to close, after a loophole in a moratorium on such operations allowed hundreds of pot retailers to open, turning the city for a time into a free-for-all of legal weed. San Diego prosecutors have waged a long-running battle against dispensaries, arguing that state law does not permit the retail pot storefronts that have become the norm. Fresno officials used zoning laws to shut down dispensaries, while an outright ban on dispensaries in Anaheim remains tied up in court. In San Jose, some dispensary operators are frustrated by what they see as contradictory messages from city government. On the one hand, the City Council has been working to reach an agreement on regulating as many as 80 pot retailers that have sprung up in the past two years. At the same time, county narcotics officers have led raids on dispensaries that investigators say are using medical marijuana as a pretense to sell drugs. Yet how much revenue cities will really see from marijuana remains difficult to predict. Dispensaries have always been required to pay state sales tax like any other business, but many would rather risk state penalties for not paying taxes than leave a paper trail for federal authorities. While the medical marijuana business has made some entrepreneurs wealthy, taxes on the drug are not universally viewed as a salvation for ailing local economies. In Sacramento, officials estimated that taxes on dispensaries would realistically bring in about 500,000 per year. A financial review earlier this year projected deficits topping 50 million annually in coming years. \\"Of course we need whatever we can get, but it's not going to make a huge dent in our problem,\\" Williams said.

Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a \\"practical conservative\\". He favored limited government and low taxes; he also stated that he approved of national defense, social security, and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them. He favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties. He opposed communism, stating, \\"A system that doesn't allow ownership ... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw.\\" He had always encouraged his fans to register to vote on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts. He even considered running for president of the United States as an independent.Zappa was an atheist. He recalled his parents being \\"pretty religious\\" and trying to make him go to Catholic school despite his resentment. He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), televangelism, and the Christian Right, and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a \\"fascist theocracy\\".In early 1990, Zappa visited Czechoslovakia at the request of President Václav Havel.

Becky Evans is the author of this story, not a planet or moon! - Cassini's gravity field: This also doesn't sound correct. Cassini is the spaceship itself. It's like trying to measure your own height using your own hands! - Cassini spacecraft's gravity field: Again, this seems a bit off because we're talking about the spacecraft again. - Craggy's gravity field: This one is also not quite right. Craggy describes the surface of the moon, not an actual place. - Earth's gravity field: If the story was about measuring Earth's gravity field, our spaceship wouldn't have needed to fly all the way to Saturn's moon, right? It can do that job from here. - Nasa's gravity field: This one's funny! NASA is an organization full of brainy scientists who investigate space. They don't have a gravity field of their own! - Rhea's gravity field: This seems likely. Rhea is the moon that our spaceship Cassini was exploring. - Saturn's gravity field: This could be a good analysis too, but since our spaceship was getting close to Rhea, it might be more interested in what's happening there. - icy moon Rhea's gravity field: Well, Rhea is an icy moon, so this answer is just a fancy way of saying \\"Rhea's gravity field\\"!  So based on all of this, the best endings would be that Cassini was studying \\"Rhea's gravity field\\" or the \\"icy moon Rhea's gravity field\\".

Given the question: -  Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained.  What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The first step of the process is the regulation of blood composition. Blood composition is highly regulated by various systems in the body. It's a process constantly at work to maintain our physiological balance. The kidneys carry out the major role in this regulation, by ensuring the right quantities of various substances while it expels metabolic waste products like urea, creatinine, etc. 1. Blood flows into the kidneys. Kidneys filter about 1/5th of the blood plasma that enters the glomeruli (the function unit of kidneys). 2. The filtered substance, also known as glomerular filtrate, enters the tubules within the kidneys. This filtrate includes water, glucose, amino acids, urea, and a variety of salts.  3. As the filtrate goes through the tubules, the kidneys carry out selective reabsorption, where the essential substances which the body still needs, such as glucose and amino acids, are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream.  4. Kidneys also perform selective secretion where additional unwanted substances such as excess potassium or hydrogen ions are also removed from blood and added into the tubules. 5. Water, salt, and electrolyte reabsorption helps in maintaining the volume and composition of blood. Meanwhile, the kidneys are actively involved in regulation of blood pH by controlling hydrogen ion concentration. 6. The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure by altering the volume of blood or amount of salt reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. 7. When oxygen levels in the body decrease, kidneys produce and release erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells, thus increasing oxygen levels. 8. The kidneys also regulate calcium level by promoting vitamin D activation, which increases the absorption of calcium in intestines. So, the primary step in this overall functioning of the kidneys is the blood flowing into the kidneys and filtration occurring in the glomerulus. This sets the stage for the series of regulation and balance processes that follow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Review: I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness. Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot on 16mm doesn't help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky.  For all the effort Bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility.  - A car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand-held extinguisher.  - A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in 2004, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack. - It would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target.  - I believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert.  - The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents. Oddly, James never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping.  - Speaking of which, the 3-man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there.  - How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he's not faking it? There were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out. These are things the characters would know, so we should too. Many of the \\"surprises\\" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis he's trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle. Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin. He's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What's the point? If this is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war movies, it's a sorry bunch. Just based on the half hour I saw of it, I'd recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead. What is the sentiment of this review?

Fully expecting for no good reason to get a job and become movie stars, and dressed for the occasion, the Stooges sneak into a movie studio—where they are mistaken for three new executives who are due to take over the facility. Given the authority, they promptly abuse it and take over the production of a movie set in hopes of shooting a blockbuster movie. Curly gets off on the wrong foot when, unable to light his match for a smoke, spots an actress receiving a pedicure (silent star Mildred Harris). He then strikes the match on the sole of her bare foot, startling her. Angered, she is about to storm off the set until the trio convince her to stay. The trio then act out the love scene as they want it filmed, leading its stars to abandon the set. Another telegram arrives with the news that three actual executives were delayed by a storm. Angered at the deception, the studio boss and the film's crew go after the Stooges, who flee the scene. After the trio is able to hide from their pursuers, they soon find themselves in a lion's den. The three quickly get into a nearby car, but the lion catches up and attacks them, leaving the car to go out of control down a nearby street.","output":"Curly, one of the Stooges, makes the actress angry by striking a match on the sole of her bare foot while she is receiving a pedicure.

Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Form of expression: This gesture is commonly used by Silvio Berlusconi as a sign of disbelief. Waving your hands in the air is as undeniably Italian as buffalo mozzarella, bankruptcy and bunga bunga. But the well known tradition of gesturing is not just an expression of their extensive range of emotions – Italians use around 250 distinct hand signals in everyday conversation, experts have revealed. Gestures, most of which originated in Naples, generally include fingers flying horizontally from the chin, exaggerated shrugs and upheld palms, and lots of exasperated cries and raised eyebrows. Some are offensive – meaning ‘gay’ or ‘cuckold’. But many are mundane: ‘can I have a cigarette’, ‘call me’. Or ‘tastes good’, virtually all now internationally recognised gestures. Perhaps the best known is the one used regularly by Silvio Berlsuconi to express disbelief at the stupidity of what someone is saying. The hands are slightly cupped, with the finger tips forming upward-pointing cones which are shaken more or less violently, depending on the degree of exasperation. Very common in Naples, it translates as ‘What do you want?’ Professor of psychology at Roma Tre University and an expert on gestures, Isabella Poggi has identified 250 individual signs, that she says are akin to a language in their own right. The signs can have quite complex meanings, she told the NY Times; ‘There are gestures expressing a threat or a wish or desperation or shame or pride,’ she said. The sign for ‘I don’t give a ****’ is an act of defiance.: ‘It’s a rebellion against power, a way of reacquiring one’s own dignity.’ The only thing that separates hand gestures from sign language is that they are used individually, she said. Meaning: The range of signs can have quite complex meanings, from desperation to shame. Here, Berlusconi seems to be pinching his lips, telling someone to stop talking. Talking with hands: The only thing that separates hand gestures from sign language is that they are used individually. No one knows for certain why the system of gestures developed. One theory is that Italians developed them as an secret language of communication during centuries of foreign occupation — by Austria, France and Spain in the 14th through 19th centuries, Professor Poggi said. And in busy cities like Naples, gesturing was a way of marking one’s territory. ‘To get attention, people gestured and used their whole bodies,’ she added. Recognisable: Some of the signs are easy to decipher. Here, the Italian Minister for Integration Cecile Kyenge is raising her hand to stop someone mid-speech. Salute: Bank of Italy deputy governor Fabrizio Saccomanni gestures during a meeting. The hand movements developed from a time when people gestured with their whole bodies. Hand gesturing appears to be an ancient phenomenon. Gestures used by the figures painted on ancient Greek vases found in the Naples area can be easily compared to those used by today’s Neapolitans. Italian writer Italo Svevo wrote in a letter to his wife from England in 1901. ‘It seems that in this country, I’m actually a laughing stock on account of my way of gesturing... Hands in pockets - only then can you speak English.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the importance of hand gestures in Italian culture, mentioning that Italians use around 250 distinct hand signals in everyday conversation, with many of these gestures originating in Naples.

Network effects are a large factor with electrification. When converting lines to electric, the connections with other lines must be considered. Some electrifications have subsequently been removed because of the through traffic to non-electrified lines. If through traffic is to have any benefit, time consuming engine switches must occur to make such connections or expensive dual mode engines must be used. This is mostly an issue for long distance trips, but many lines come to be dominated by through traffic from long-haul freight trains (usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports). In theory, these trains could enjoy dramatic savings through electrification, but it can be too costly to extend electrification to isolated areas, and unless an entire network is electrified, companies often find that they need to continue use of diesel trains even if sections are electrified. The increasing demand for container traffic which is more efficient when utilizing the double-stack car also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost.

Article:Paramedics treated about 12,000 people who were so drunk it was noted on Scottish Ambulance Service systems in the six months to the end of September. The figures were obtained by the Scottish Conservatives under freedom of information laws. The ambulance service said alcohol had a significant impact on its operations. It comes after a recent internal Scottish Ambulance Service survey showed alcohol was a factor in more than half of all call-outs ambulance staff dealt with at weekends. The latest figures showed Scotland's largest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, had the highest number of alcohol-related 999 call-outs in the six month period at 3,849. It was followed by NHS Lothian, with 1,935, and NHS Lanarkshire, with 1,470. Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the statistics highlighted how \\"deep-rooted and complex\\" a problem alcohol is in Scottish society. He said: \\"Not only is it harming those who are over-consuming, but it is diverting scarce resources away from those whose need was not so avoidable. \\"Of course the Scottish government and NHS can always do more to discourage reckless patterns of drinking and provide more help for paramedics who have to repeatedly go into these challenging situations - often several times each shift. \\"But ultimately this is a case of personal responsibility, and that's where the real change has to come from.\\" A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said its teams had to respond to an increase in demand over the festive period, which was largely driven by alcohol. He added: \\"They are highly trained professionals who are frustrated by the amount of time they spend looking after patients who are simply intoxicated. \\"Our staff should not have to fear for their own safety when responding to patients but alcohol is often a key factor in assaults. \\"Assaults or threatening behaviour are reported to the police and support and counselling services are available to staff.\\" Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said a recent four nations report found that Scotland was leading the way in the UK in taking action to tackle alcohol misuse.

Watching her favorite beauty influencers like James Charles, NikkieTutorials, and Jackie Aina, she slowly but surely became more and more adept at the art of makeup application. One sunny afternoon, Jamie felt a surge of inspiration and decided to try her hand at an adventurous, new look. After hours of watching beauty tutorials from her favorite gurus, she was eager to put her skills to the test. She began by selecting shades from her favorite eyeshadow palette - a mix of sparkly blues and deep purples, meant to mimic the colors of a night sky. She started with blending lighter hues in the crease of her eyelid, aiming for a sophisticated smoky effect. This step took the most time, as Jamie methodically layered and blended the eyeshadows, painstakingly ensuring the perfect level of shading. With the eyelids taking shape, she continued with the highlight, applying shimmering silver on the brow bone and inner corner of her eye. Satisfied with the iridescent glow, Jamie proceeded to apply a black gel eyeliner, gently winging it out at the corners. She was keen on it being sharp, following Jackie's advice of aiming for a liner that could cut. Finally, she put on a generous coat of mascara, lifting her lashes to the sky. The next piece in Jamie's makeup masterpiece was a stunning contour. Defined cheekbones were the goal, so she carefully picked a cool-toned bronzer to deepen the hollows of her cheeks. Just like Nikkie taught her, she used a slightly damp beauty sponge to blend the bronzer seamlessly, giving her face dimension. Jamie then skillfully applied blush to the apples of her cheeks, adding a flush of warmth. This time, she opted for a rosy pink, a tribute to her childhood memories of playing dress-up. She illuminated her cheekbones, tip of her nose, and cupid's bow with an ice-white highlighter, capturing an ethereal glow. The finishing touch was her lips. Pondering her options, she decided on a matte plum lipstick, matching it to the shades of the eyeshadow. Meticulously outlining her lips, she filled them in with the rich color. Once completed, she looked in the mirror, blinking in surprise at the transformation. Her handiwork had paid off, showcasing her newfound skills in blending, highlighting, and bringing drama to her look. She felt empowered, like her favorite beauty influencers, ready to make a bold statement. That night, she posted a picture of her masterpiece on Instagram, her heart swelling with pride as the likes and comments poured in. Friends both old and new showered her with compliments, marveling at her newfound talent and how far she had come.

Question: I have waited tables, but before that, our friend group were regulars at several local “open all night” establishments. Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.

Translate to English","output":"At this point, it is quite evident that there are various opinions present. In any discussion or debate, it is not uncommon to find that there are several differing viewpoints. These varying opinions often stem from the diverse experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives of the individuals involved. In many cases, such diversity in opinion can prove to be quite healthy, as it can foster constructive dialogue and bring forth ideas that might not have otherwise been considered. One must remember that when they encounter multiple opinions, it is crucial to maintain an open mind and a willingness to listen to others. Underestimating the value of differing viewpoints can lead to narrow-mindedness and a lack of progress in solving complex issues. A key aspect of productive dialogue involves acknowledging and respecting these differences, as well as valuing the insights that they may provide. While it may be natural to form an initial bias towards one's own perspective, it is important to be mindful of this tendency and to actively work towards maintaining an objective and balanced stance. One way to foster understanding and bridge the gaps between conflicting viewpoints is to engage in active listening, which means truly paying attention to what the other person is saying, asking clarifying questions, and providing affirmations in order to enhance the conversation. Another strategy to derive benefit from a variety of opinions is to be willing to adapt and even change one's own stance when presented with compelling evidence or well-reasoned arguments. This flexibility not only reflects a genuine commitment to achieving the best possible outcome but also demonstrates a spirit of cooperation and collaboration. We must also bear in mind that while some differences in thought may seem irreconcilable, many times these disagreements can be explored further to identify common ground or areas of mutual interest. Adopting a more inclusive and empathetic approach to exploring divergent perspectives can often result in the discovery of workable compromises and innovative solutions. In this way, when confronted with numerous opinions in any given situation, it is vital to recognize the value of differing viewpoints, engage in open communication and dialogue, and work towards identifying commonalities while respecting and learning from the diverse perspectives present. Ultimately, embracing the richness of ideas that come from various opinions not only broadens our understanding of the world but also helps us grow as individuals and as a collective."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\"? ?  Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170° W—everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.

Franco-Prussian War When the news arrived at Paris of the surrender at Sedan of Napoleon III and 80,000 men, the Second Empire was overthrown by a popular uprising in Paris, which forced the proclamation of a Provisional Government and a Third Republic by general Trochu, Favre and Gambetta at Paris on 4 September, the new government calling itself the Government of National Defence. After the German victory at Sedan, most of the French standing army was either besieged in Metz or prisoner of the Germans, who hoped for an armistice and an end to the war. Bismarck wanted an early peace but had difficulty in finding a legitimate French authority with which to negotiate. The Government of National Defence had no electoral mandate, the Emperor was a captive and the Empress in exile but there had been no abdication de jure and the army was still bound by an oath of allegiance to the defunct imperial régime.

OLD TOWN - the heart and soul of Key West and the place most visitors spend their time - is only one mile by two. The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it. What is probably true about Paul?

While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself Merrick (Donald Sutherland). He informs her that she is The Slayer, or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail.

After several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos (Rutger Hauer), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn (Paul Reubens). Two young men, Oliver Pike (Luke Perry), and best friend Benny (David Arquette), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they are attacked by Amilyn. Benny is turned but Pike is saved by Merrick. As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Computers are beneficial for almost anyone and the present generation is growing in an atmosphere  where you need the computers for doing almost everything .If they are not made computer literate  they will lag behind in all the activities. Nowadays almost all schools have some kind of computer courses for the students so that they learn the fundamentals of the computer. It will not be possible to do it if they don't have computer classes. Most of the homes have personal computers now and most children are already aware of the basics before they join school. Computing courses are also good for adults who are not familiar with the computer as most of the jobs which are available today have the use of computer in some way or the other. Adults who have not used the computer before are generally quite anxious, but an easy computing course will be able to change the way they think in a few weeks. If you are interested, you can join a computing course which is longer and teaches you more than the basics, but you may have to spend more time in the completing course.

Our premise, or the information we are given, says that when a letter carrier is doing in-office work, they are sequencing or arranging the mail. It does not say anything about delivering mail during this time. But our hypothesis, or the statement we are testing, says in-office work includes delivering mail. That does not match our premise.

While attending the funeral of his father, Melvin Devereux (John Savage), meets a beautiful young woman (Sandi Schultz) who addresses him by name, although he cannot remember having met her before. After an enigmatic exchange of casual words, Devereux drives away, motoring aimlessly around New Orleans. Devereux decides to ignore warning barriers and drives onto a closed freeway. But the police follow him and he is forced to turn aside. His car breaks down in a decapitated area of the city. But the mysterious young woman again appears, suggesting that he try a mechanic located nearby to fix his car. After helping Devereux push his car to the garage, the young woman again refuses to explain how she knows him or tell him her name. While waiting, the woman suggests they go to a motel nearby, apparently for sex. After checking into a room, and getting ready in the bathroom, Devereux exits and discovers that she is gone, leaving behind a message written on a mirror in red lipstick which says that the time is not yet right.Having collected his repaired vehicle, Devereux encounters a hearse driving on the road ahead. When he attempts to overtake it, the driver (Richard Castleman) deliberately swerves to prevent him. Turning off onto more treacherous country roads, Devereux nearly gets stranded when his car gets stuck in muddy terrain, and he barely negotiates a rickety wooden bridge.At last finding his way back to the main road, he stops off at a local roadside bar for a drink where the hearse is also parked outside. In a drunken altercation, Deveveux challenges the driver to reveal whose body he is transporting. The folded ribbon adorning the casket seen inside the hearse bears a name tantalizingly similar to Devereux's own. The confused, now frightened man follows the hearse to a church where an all-black congregation is mourning at another funeral.

Article: Early in the 16th century men were trying to reach Asia by traveling west from Europe. In order to find Asia they had to find a way past South America. The man who finally found the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific was Ferdinand Magellan. Magellan sailed from Seville in August, 1519 with five ships and about 280 men. Fourteen months later, after spending the cold winter on the coast of Patagonia, he discovered the channel which is now called Magellan Strait . In November, 1520, after many months of dangers from rocks and storms, the three remaining ships entered the ocean on the other side of South America. They then continued, hoping to reach Asia. But they did not see any land until they reached the islands off the coast of Asia. Before they arrived at these islands, later known as the Philippines, men were dying of starvation. While they were staying in the Philippines, Magellan was killed in a battle. The remaining officers then had to get back to Spain. They decided to sail round Africa. After many difficulties, one ship with eighteen men sailed into Seville three years after leaving. They were all that remained of Magellan's expedition. However, their achievement was great.

Article: Three French students were charged at the weekend over the murder of a fellow student after an attempt to dissolve her body in acid inspired by the TV series “Breaking Bad” was discovered.      The battered and decomposing body of Eva Bourseau, 23, allegedly killed over a £4,250 drugs debt, was found by her mother in a plastic container at her flat in Toulouse, in the south of France, last month.      One suspect admitted to police they had tried to mimic a scene from the hit American show in which a struggling chemistry teacher and one of his former students go into the drugs business and use acid to dispose of the body of a murdered rival, prosecution sources said.      They bought “acid and a plastic trunk to immerse the body and dissolve it”, a source said. The TV series highlighted the need to use a plastic container as acid would dissolve metal.      Described as “brilliant students”, the three young men had become involved in drugs and started dealing amphetamines to other students, according to their lawyers.      Photo: AFP      Two of them allegedly went to the home of Eva Bourseau, who was studying art history, to collect the money she owed them. When she failed to pay, they launched a frenzied attack with a crowbar and knuckledusters.      Afterwards they behaved in a cool-headed manner, returning to the flat several times in the next two days to check on the condition of the body, replace air fresheners covering up the smell of decomposing flesh and steal valuables, according to prosecution sources.      They apparently believed it would take several days for the body to dissolve but the plan went wrong when Eva’s mother, worried by her daughter’s failure to return calls, went to the flat and made the macabre discovery.      Two suspects have been placed under formal investigation, a stage in the French legal process equivalent to being charged, for murder. A third man has been charged as an accomplice. The youngest suspect is 19 and the others are in their 20s.      Pierre Alfort, the lawyer for one of the suspects, an engineering student, said his client “went wrong when he got involved in the party scene and local nightlife.” |||||       A forensics team loads the remains of a woman onto a vehicle after her dismembered body was found in a plastic storage trunk in a building in Toulouse on Aug. 4, 2015. (AFP/Getty Images)      Four French students have been arrested and indicted in connection with the killing of a 23-year-old woman who was found dead last week, dismembered and decomposing in a plastic container filled with acid, police said.      Three men and a woman, ages 19 to 23, were indicted in southern France during the weekend in connection with the slaying, which was thought to be inspired by AMC’s dark drama “Breaking Bad,” the prosecutor told Agence France-Presse. Two men were indicted for murder, drug trafficking and robbery. The third was indicted for murder by complicity. The men remain in custody.      The woman was indicted for drug trafficking and put under judicial supervision.      [Maraschino cherry king, caught with alleged underground marijuana operation, commits suicide]      Eva Bourseau, a 23-year-old former student in Toulouse, France, apparently owed the drug dealers more than 6,500. When she failed to pay, the suspects sought revenge, police said. On July 26, two male suspects reportedly went to her apartment and allegedly beat her to death with “brass knuckles and a crowbar,” according to a rough translation of a French AFP report.      Bourseau was allegedly killed by a blow to the head, according to the French newspaper Local.      The prosecutor said when it came time to hide the evidence, the suspects took a cue from “Breaking Bad,” a TV show in which characters Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) were seen several times throughout the series disposing of victims’ bodies by submerging them in plastic tubs filled with hydrofluoric acid. The suspects allegedly used chlorine acid, according to Radio France Internationale.      The suspects bought “the acid and a polyethylene trunk to immerse the body,” the prosecutor told AFP. Then they allegedly removed Bourseau’s legs to fit her entire body into the container, according to the Local.      For days after the incident, police said, the suspects returned to the scene, stealing from her apartment and spraying air fresheners to mask the stench.      It wasn’t until about 10 days after Bourseau’s death that police found her remains.      [Portland’s real-life ‘Breaking Bad': Former chemistry teacher charged with manufacturing methamphetamine]      Police responded to a call Aug. 3 from Bourseau’s mother and a friend who said they had not been able to reach her for two weeks, according to the Local. When police arrived at the scene, the door was locked, forcing firefighters to climb in through a skylight. They found her body in “advanced stages of decomposition,” a police representative told AFP, according to the Local.      Bourseau was a former student at a top university in Toulouse where she reportedly studied humanities and languages. She had dropped out and fallen in with “the wrong crowd,” according to Radio France Internationale.      Indeed, fictional portrayals similar to her death and disposal were captured in “Breaking Bad.” In season one, for instance, Pinkman poured hydrofluoric acid into a bathtub to dispose of his former business partner Emilio Koyama. The acid ate through the tub and the second floor of the home. In seasons four and five, White and Pinkman used the same method to destroy bodies.      [Walter White and LBJ?

Last year, 28-year-old Jason Hart pleaded guilty in Washington state to strangling his girlfriend in 2013 and trying to dissolve her body in acid, WHQ-TV reported. He took a plea deal that put him behind bars for a roughly 14-year prison sentence.      A woman in the United Kingdom last year said she mimicked the show when she tried to poison her mother. “It was like I saw myself to be some kind of Mexican drug warlord,” she said in court, according to the Guardian. “I would think it through as if I was the main character in ‘Breaking Bad.'” A man from Liverpool was found guilty this year of trying to buy enough ricin to kill 1,400 people from a dealer on the Dark Web, BBC News reported.      The case in France is still under investigation. ||||| The victim's body was found decomposing in a flat in Toulouse on Monday night, after having being cut up into pieces, covered in cling film and bunged into a suitcase.      Apparently chlorine acid had been used to try and disguise any trace of the corpse      Her killers did everything to avoid getting caught... Going so far as to barricade the victim's door from police and blasting the flat with air freshner to hide the rotting smell.      It's believed they were inspired by the American prison series \\"Breaking Bad.\\"      All this was of course in revenge for the victim failing to pay back a 6,000 euro debt, contracted over the course of drug selling, or lack of in this case.      The victim, 23 year old Eva Bourseau, had been studying Humanities and languages at one of the top universities in Toulouse before dropping out, and that's when she fell in with the wrong crowd.      Three men and a woman aged between 19 and 22, are in custody over her murder, which is being treated as premeditated manslaughter.      This case has once again reignited the problem of drug trafficking in Toulouse, which contrary to popular belief is common. This time last year, two suspected revenge killings were reported linked to the city’s illegal drugs trade.      However, Marseille, France’s second largest city, still has a far higher death toll linked to drug traffickers in the city’s northern districts. ||||| Suspects reportedly planned to dissolve the victim's body in acid.

Her legs had reportedly been cut off in order to fit her body inside the container.

A woman and three men, all between the ages of 19 and 23 and all with a criminal record, have since been arrested in connection with the murder, and by Friday a prosecutor revealed some of the grisly details.      Two men in the group went to the woman's house to settle a €6,000 drug debt. There, they beat her violently, killing her through a blow to the skull. The prosecutor said they later bought acid in order to dissolve her body.      The prosecutor explained that the suspects had been inspired by a US TV show Breaking Bad, where the lead characters use Hydrofluoric acid - a highly corrosive acid - to dissolve the bodies of their victims.      The young men had repeatedly visited the apartment in the days following the woman's murder in order to clean the scene, to steal from the home, and to check up on the decomposition of the body. The men had reportedly left air fresheners in the flat to disguise the smell.      The investigation continues. ||||| Police remained on the scene on Tuesday afternoon.

The shepherd realizes that he forgot to bring grain for the cattle, yet the cattle will survive just fine in the field, because What's the answer? Possible answers: (a). they eat roughage (b). they hunt meat (c). they eat insects (d). they eat prey","output":"The answer is: (a). they eat roughage Explanation: A herd of cattle will survive just fine in a field without the shepherd providing grain because cows are herbivores, meaning they only eat plants. One of the primary components of a cow's diet is roughage, which can be found in abundance within a large field. Roughage refers to fibrous, indigestible plant material, such as hay, grass, and silage.  Cows have a specialized stomach with four compartments - the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. This unique digestive system allows them to break down and extract nutrients from different types of plant materials like cellulose, which is difficult for many other animals to digest. When cows consume roughage, the fibrous plant material is broken down through fermentation by the microorganisms present in the rumen. Once the roughage has been fermented and the nutrients are absorbed, the remaining fibrous material, known as cud, is regurgitated back into the cow's mouth for further chewing and digestion. In a large field, cows will naturally graze on the available plant resources, providing them with a diverse and balanced diet. This field diet will consist primarily of grass, which can either be short, young, and leafy, or mature with higher amounts of stem material. Cows may also consume other plants that are available in the field, such as clover, which can add valuable nutrients to their diet. So, the cattle can sustain themselves perfectly well just by grazing in the field, as they can get all the necessary nutrients from the available vegetation, thanks to their herbivorous nature and specialized digestive systems. The other options provided are not plausible: (b). they hunt meat - Cows do not hunt for meat, as they are herbivores and only eat plants. (c). they eat insects - Although cows may indirectly ingest some insects while grazing on grass, insects are not a primary or significant food source for them. (d). they eat prey - Cows do not eat prey animals, as they are herbivores and their diet consists solely of plant materials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: who attracts the young aristocrat Jakob? Movie title: Kispus Movie plot: Copenhagen in the 1950s. On her way to work, the young woman Eva Møller (Helle Virkner) stops by a clothes store to speak to Børge (Holger Juul Hansen), who has broken their engagement in a brief letter. She finds him with another girl and agitatedly tells him off. Eva works as a seamstress and chats with a co-worker (Caja Heimann) about having too little money and her desire to find a rich man to ease her worries. Their supervisor shouts at Eva for being late and talking too much. After work, Eva is left alone as her co-worker is picked up by her boyfriend. As she walks through the streets she comes across a store with a beautiful gown in the window. As she stands there looking at it, she appears to have an idea and rushes to the house where she lives with her older brother (Ove Sprogøe) and his wife (Lis Løwert). She changes her clothes and picks up her bankbook and is out the door again. She goes back to the store intending to buy the dress, but the saleswoman tells her it's already been sold, and Eva realizes that it would have been too expensive for her anyway. When the saleswoman (Inger Lassen) goes into another room, Eva sees the dress in a corner and goes to look at it, and when the saleswoman locks up and leaves the store moments later, she doesn't realize that Eva is still inside. Eva puts the dress on and dances around the room imagining it's her own. Suddenly a man appears. He turns out to be the dress designer, Marcel (Angelo Bruun), and instead of being upset he is stunned by her graceful appearance. He has her stay at the store all night to wear his fabrics as he draws new designs. In the morning, shocked by the dull appearance of her usual clothing, he allows her to have the dress from the window as a gift.Eva has to go straight to work and changes into her work clothes in the lavatory. Not having slept all night, however, she falls asleep, dreaming of colourful scenes of love and adoration (including a singing Poul Reichhardt). She is fired, but only has smiles to offer in return. Eva goes... A:","output":"The young aristocrat Jakob is attracted to Eva Møller, the young woman who works as a seamstress and dreams of finding a rich man to ease her worries.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Available options:  A). negative  B). positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? a modestly surprising movie","output":"The phrase \\"a modestly surprising movie\\" can be considered to lean towards a positive stance, with a mention of a slight surprise element. To further analyze this phrase, we'll dissect its components and provide a detailed explanation. 1. Modesty: The word \\"modestly\\" implies that the surprise element is not extreme but rather within an acceptable or reasonable range. The use of \\"modestly\\" serves to temper the degree of surprise, suggesting that it may not have exceeded expectations by a large margin. Despite not being strongly positive, humility is often seen as a good trait. Essentially, this term reflects a sense of balance, which often conveys a positive connotation. 2. Surprise: Generally, a surprising movie could sway both positively or negatively. However, in this context, with the phrase leaning towards the positive side, the surprising aspect implies that the movie had some elements that exceeded the viewer's expectations. Surprise generally indicates that the viewer experienced something unexpected, which could make the movie more enjoyable, engaging, or thought-provoking. When combining these two words, \\"a modestly surprising movie\\" suggests that the film offered a pleasant experience with a mild degree of unexpected elements. While it may not be an overwhelmingly positive review, it does provide a positive outlook on the movie as it managed to surprise and likely entertain the viewer to some extent. Ultimately, this phrase can be categorized under option B (positive), albeit with some consideration of the humble nature of its praise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sanders tells deported U.S. vet through border fence: ‘We’d like you on this side’ Many politicians and even several presidential candidates have visited U.S.-Mexico border to talk about immigration or border security. But Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders generated buzz this past weekend when he actually walked up to the border fence and told a deported veteran on the Mexican side that he wanted him on the U.S. side. Hector Barajas, an activist who has pushed for deported U.S. service members to be allowed back in the country, called out to Sanders during his border visit and identified himself as a former soldier in the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division. “Thank you very much for your service to this country,” Sanders said. “And we would like you on this side.” Barajas, 39, is a convicted felon – he fired a gun during an altercation – who after getting deported established the Deported Veterans Support House in 2013. Barajas has a lifetime ban from re-entry to the U.S. after he was caught in the country visiting his daughter illegally. It isn’t clear if Sanders was aware of Barajas’ immigration status when he exchanged words with him. The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to requests from Fox News Latino seeking comment. The deported veteran also attended Sanders’ last visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona. In a Spanish-language video interview after the event, Barajas told journalist Jorge Nieto that getting Sanders’ verbal support was “great.” \\"In Nogales, the Secret Service didn’t let us get close,\\" he said, \\"so it was very cool that he got so close here, because we could basically touch him.” Barajas has said that there are an estimated 12,000 military veterans who have been deported by the U.S. government. During Sanders' tour of Friendship Park, which is used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents as a place where families that have been separated by deportation can meet up, the candidate also spoke about the importance of reforming the country’s broken immigration system. “All of this tells us why we need comprehensive immigration reform,” he said after hearing the stories of people who gathered there. Sanders – who trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the delegate count, but has vowed to take his campaign fight all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July – also took the opportunity to criticize the immigration proposals of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who has made building a border wall a linchpin of his campaign. \\"It’s not only an immoral perspective from my point of view,” Sanders said, according to his campaign. “It’s something that should not happen, cannot happen. What we need to do is to recognize the reality of the moment, that we have a broken immigration system.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders visiting the U.S.-Mexico border and speaking with a deported U.S. military veteran named Hector Barajas, who is an activist advocating for the return of deported service members to the United States.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you have a runny or stuffed nose, do not automatically assume it is a sinus infection. Typically, home care of over the counter antihistamines, rest, hydration and cold remedies can be utilized to help your body recover. The unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics is causing bacteria to no longer respond to antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. To avoid this, allow yourself time to rest and recuperate before contacting your doctor. If necessary, your doctor can evaluate your condition and prescribe medicines to help you recover and feel better.  Seek help if you experience any of the following symptoms:   Sinus congestion that lasts for more than 10 days A fever of 102°F (38.9°C) or higher Symptoms that improve and then worse at or around the 6th day of your illness Ask your doctor for recommendations on what over the counter medicines might help to ease your symptoms. Sinus infections are often accompanied by mucus buildup and congestion, medicines that fight these symptoms can help you get relief. These medicines are available in both pill form and as a nasal spray.  Popular decongestant pills include phenylephrine (Sudafed PE) and pseudoephedrine (Sudafed). Generic versions of these medicines will work just as well as long as they contain the same ingredients. Don't use nasal sprays, such as Afrin, for more than three days unless directed — this can actually increase congestion. Painkillers (or analgesia) won't usually fight the direct cause of the sinus infection, but they can help with painful aches and sinus pressure. Always follow the directions on the label with these medications — they can be dangerous if taken in very high doses. Don't rely on OTC painkillers for more than about a week and a half without consulting with a doctor.  Ibuprofen is an especially good choice because it's also an anti-inflammatory. This means that it can reduce the swelling in the sinus passages, helping to relieve mucus buildup and pressure. Other good OTC painkillers include acetaminophen (paracetamol) and naproxen sodium. Only take recommended dosages of these medications. Overdoing it with these medications can cause serious issues, such as kidney or liver problems. Sinus infections can have a wide variety of causes. For instance, some sinus infections aren't the result of a disease, but instead a reaction to substances in the air that the sufferer is allergic to. Luckily, there are medicines available to fight allergy symptoms and make you feel better:  Most OTC medicines used for allergies belong to a type of drugs called antihistamines. Examples include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), Brompheniramine (Dimetapp), and Loratadine (Claritin). If you have a sinus infection and you haven't ever been tested for allergies, it can be a wise idea to schedule an allergy test with your doctor. This can prevent you from wasting time with solutions that don't work for you. Antibiotics are a type of medicine that kills harmful bacteria in the body. If your doctor believes that your sinus infection is caused by bacteria, she or he may prescribe you some antibiotics to fight it. Do not take antibiotics that were not prescribed for you and do not take old antibiotics that were prescribed for a different condition.  If you are given antibiotics, it is important to follow your doctor's instructions as you use it. Don't stop taking it if you feel better before you're done with the medicine — always take the full course of antibiotics. This can cause the bacteria to adapt to that antibiotic, which will keep it from working in the future. Keep in mind that the use of antibiotics to treat sinus infections is controversial among doctors, so some doctors may not be willing to prescribe them. In some cases sinusitis may be severe or chronic in nature, and not due to bacterial infection. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe you a type of medicine administered through nasal spray which includes a corticosteroid. These drugs help fight inflammation in your sinus passages, improving the flow of mucus and relieving pressure. Brands include Nasacort and Flonase.","output":"This article is about treating runny or stuffed noses and not assuming it's a sinus infection, it suggests home care remedies, over the counter medicines, and when to see a doctor for proper treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships. The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \\"significant\\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge. Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase. These comparatively new developments will run alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August). Launched in 1982, the Universities Summer School is an intensive residential course open to boys and girls throughout the UK who attend state schools, are at the end of their first year in the Sixth Form, and are about to begin their final year of schooling. The Brent-Eton Summer School, started in 1994, offers 40-50 young people from the London Borough of Brent, an area of inner-city deprivation, an intensive one-week residential course, free of charge, designed to help bridge the gap between GCSE and A-level. In 2008, Eton helped found the Eton, Slough, Windsor and Hounslow Independent and State School Partnership (ISSP), with six local state schools. The ISSP's aims are \\"to raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools\\". Eton also runs a number of choral and English language courses during the summer months. How many students attended Eton free of charge in 2014?","output":"In 2014, 63 students attended Eton free of charge.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process is the formation of a white dwarf.  After the outer layers of the red giant break away, the remaining inner core, consisting mostly of carbon and oxygen, starts to cool and contract under the force of gravity. As the core contracts, it becomes denser and more stable. Eventually, it reaches a state where electron degeneracy pressure, a quantum mechanical effect, balances the force of gravity, preventing further contraction. This stable, dense object is called a white dwarf. Over time, the white dwarf will continue to cool and gradually radiate away its residual heat, eventually becoming a black dwarf. However, the timescale required for this process is much longer than the current age of the universe, so no black dwarfs are expected to exist yet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I took my mom here for mothers day a couple of years ago and had an absolutely awful experience, which embarrased me beyond belief. The bag boys were rude, the pro shop was unjustly impatient, the snack bar was closed (they said it would be open,) and the drink cart did not come by one time during our entire round. We even called the pro shop from cell phones to complain on about the 12th hole saying there was no water in the drinking water jugs on the course, the cart girl had never come by, and the bathrooms were all locked and the cart key did not open them. The guys in the shop were apologetic, and said they would send someone right out to help us, but we didn't see anyone. On the 14th hole, the ranger came by and he had some towels which kept us cool, and we let him know how disappointed we were that the drink cart wasn't coming by, the snack bar was closed, and there was no water in the drinking water jugs. Basically that we could not get water, and it was 100 degrees outside! He apologized profusely and said he would see us on the next hole with waters and bathroom keys, but we never did see him the rest of the round.  When we got back to the clubhouse, the bag boy was sitting on a chair under an umbrella watching us take the bags off the cart and stare him down. I'm sure he realized we were pissed he wasn't doing his job, but he offered no apologies or assistance. I later told someone in the pro shop about all the problems we had and he basically told us that we should expect this in the summertime.   I've played golf for 20 years in Arizona, and most of it in the summer because I can actually afford to play then, and never had such an awful experience. I felt like I was playing on a closed golf course. A letter to their director of golf Joe Shershanova got a written apology and a comp round, but it didn't make up a ruined mothers day that I spent a lot of my hard earned money on... I don't make much.  The second experience was average. Choices: 1. negative. 2. positive.","output":"The sentiment of the following review is 1. negative.  The reviewer describes multiple negative experiences throughout their visit to the golf course. They mention various disappointments, such as rude staff, the snack bar being closed despite being told it would be open, lack of drinking water while playing in high temperatures, and locked bathrooms. Furthermore, the reviewer felt embarrassed and upset, as this visit occurred on Mother's Day, and they had spent their hard-earned money on the experience, expecting a higher level of service. Although the reviewer was offered a written apology and a complimentary round of golf to compensate for their negative experience, they still felt that this did not make up for the ruined Mother's Day. They describe their second experience as \\"average,\\" which also indicates that they did not have an overwhelmingly positive outcome after their first disappointing visit.

Expand this summary.","output":"A college student named Mollie Tibbetts from Iowa has gone missing and everyone, including her family, is very worried and looking for her. Her family is hoping and believes that she is still alive. Her dad, Robert Tibbetts, has shared a theory or a guess about what he thinks might have happened to her. He thinks Mollie knew the person who has taken her and that she trusted them. This means that he thinks Mollie went with this person on her own, thinking that she would be safe with them. But now, her dad believes that things have gotten out of control for this person and they don't know what to do. Robert, Mollie's dad, also mentioned that this is just his guess and not something he knows for sure. He thinks Mollie might be with someone who cares about him but somehow, their relationship or understanding of each other got mixed up, leading to something wrong or bad happening. To give you an idea about how close Robert was with his daughter Mollie, there's a really beautiful fact about them. When Robert got married earlier this year, Mollie was the best man at his wedding. A best man usually is a close friend or brother, so this shows Mollie and her father had a special friendship.

A attorney Answer:","output":"Title: The Occupant Genre: Thriller, Drama Act 1: Mitch Martin, a successful lawyer at a prestigious law firm in New York City, is handed a high-profile case involving the notorious real estate tycoon, Alexander King. King is accused of rampant injustices such as evictions of low-income families and illegal demolitions to make way for his luxury skyscrapers. Mitch is torn; on one hand, he is aware that representing King would mean turning a blind eye to the suffering of helpless citizens, but on the other hand, his career advancement depends on his success in defending King. Act 2: As Mitch starts preparing for the case, he discovers that one of his childhood friends, Joey, is among the wronged tenants about to be evicted by King's corporation. Joey's family lives in an old apartment building which Alexander King has acquired unlawfully, and they now face the threat of losing their home. Mitch is even more conflicted, torn between his personal connection to the case and his loyalty to his prestigious law firm. Act 3: Growing increasingly disillusioned with King's tactics and the unjust world of corporate law, Mitch secretly starts working against his own client. He uses his legal expertise and inside knowledge of King's empire to help the evicted tenants build a class-action lawsuit against Alexander King. As Mitch goes deeper undercover, he faces opposition from King's security personnel who are always monitoring the tenants. As the case progresses, Mitch's colleagues and superiors become suspicious of him, jeopardizing his job and safety. Act 4: Mitch successfully builds a strong case against Alexander King with the help of the tenants, using the concept of \\"occupancy\\" to argue their rights against King's illegal takeover. He presents evidence proving Alexander King's illegal actions, including forged documents and bribes to government officials. Mitch manages to get King charged with fraud, racketeering, and several other crimes. Act 5: Alexander King's enemies and criminal partners, infuriated by Mitch's victory, attempt to retaliate against Mitch and the tenants. But they are caught in a trap orchestrated by Mitch, which eventually brings down their criminal network. Mitch chooses to act as a pro-bono attorney for the tenants and gives up his lucrative career at the prestigious law firm. He starts working independently, focusing on social justice and advocating the rights of the underprivileged. In the end, Mitch sacrifices his high-paying job and a significant part of his personal life but gains a sense of fulfillment and purpose as an attorney who serves justice. He restores Joey's family's occupancy and is celebrated as the champion of the common people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The given premise states that \\"To measure this value, it is important to assess how reductions in air pollution reduce the risk of dying from the time that reductions take effect onward, and how individuals value these changes.\\" This premise implies a connection between the measurement of the value in question and the assessment of reductions in air pollution in relation to the risk of dying from the time these reductions come into play. The hypothesis \\"It is important to assess how reductions in air pollution reduce the risk of dying from the time that reductions take effect onward in order to measure this value\\" directly aligns with the premise. It highlights the necessity of evaluating the impact of air pollution reductions on mortality risk from the time they become effective in order to determine the value being measured.  Moreover, both the premise and the hypothesis emphasize the importance of understanding the temporal aspect of air pollution reductions (i.e., the time that reductions take effect onward) and its relation to the risk of dying.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions you provided are different. The first question is about effective ways to get organized for school, while the second question is about the relationship between wheel alignment and the suspension system in a vehicle. To address both questions: 1. Best ways to get organized for school: Step 1: Gather necessary materials To get organized for school, identify and obtain the required supplies, such as notebooks, binders, textbooks, pens, pencils, etc. Step 2: Create a study space Designate a quiet, comfortable space dedicated to studying and completing assignments; this will help you focus and maintain productivity while working on school tasks. Step 3: Develop a routine Establish a daily routine to help manage your time effectively; this includes designated times for studying, doing homework, and participating in extracurricular activities. Step 4: Use a planner or digital calendar Use a planner or digital calendar to schedule your classes, activities, assignments, and other events, so you can easily keep track of deadlines and commitments. Step 5: Prioritize tasks Prioritize tasks by their due dates and importance; this will help you manage your workload and reduce stress. Step 6: Break tasks into smaller parts Break larger tasks or projects into smaller, more manageable parts, and allocate specific time slots to each part. This will help you maintain a steady pace and prevent last-minute rushes. Step 7: Keep your workspace clean and organized Regularly clean and organize your workspace, so you can find your supplies easily and work more efficiently. 2. Relation between wheel alignment and suspension system: Wheel alignment and suspension system in a vehicle are interrelated, as they both contribute to the stability and performance of the car.  Step 1: Understand the purpose of wheel alignment Wheel alignment refers to adjusting the angles of the wheels so that they meet the manufacturer's specifications, ensuring that the wheels are properly aligned with the vehicle's suspension system. Step 2: Understand the role of the suspension system The suspension system primarily handles the car's weight distribution, providing an even and firm grip between the tires and road. It also absorbs shocks and maintains ride stability during acceleration, braking, and cornering. Step 3: Identify the connection between wheel alignment and suspension system Misaligned wheels can negatively impact the suspension system, causing uneven tire wear, decreased fuel efficiency, and unstable handling. Proper wheel alignment allows the suspension system to work effectively, maximizing tire contact with the road and improving overall vehicle performance.

Q:You are given a new situation: There are two neighboring planets in another solar system. The people of Mandron use many fossil fuels to power things that require electricity. The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all.  and a hint : Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.  Please answer this question : The habitats of which planet's animals are in more danger? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it is clear that the habitats of the animals on the planet Mandron are in more danger compared to Liptar. There are several reasons to support this conclusion. 1. Use of fossil fuels: The people of Mandron rely heavily on the use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, to fulfill their energy requirements. Burning these fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and lead to an increase in the planet's average temperature. This is a process known as global warming or global climate change. 2. Global warming and its impact: As mentioned, even a small increase in the average temperature due to global warming can have significant negative impacts on the habitats of various species. Organisms living in the wild need to continuously adapt to their environment, and rapid changes in climate can be highly stressful and hazardous for them. Temperature-sensitive species, such as certain fish, can face issues when trying to reproduce if their habitat becomes too warm – even if this temperature increase is temporary. Additionally, rising temperatures can destroy habitats, for example, by causing ice caps and glaciers to melt, flooding low-lying areas and leading to loss of habitat for species that have adapted to live in those particular environments. 3. Sustainable energy use on Liptar: On the other hand, the people of Liptar have developed a way to harness water as a source of power, reducing their dependence on fossil fuels. This approach to energy generation has less impact on the environment and in turn minimizes the human-induced climate change. As a result, the animals on Liptar face fewer threats to their habitats from the consequences of global warming. In conclusion, the animals on the planet Mandron are in greater danger due to their reliance on fossil fuels, which contributes to global warming and potential habitat destruction. In contrast, the people of Liptar have found a more sustainable energy source in the form of water power, which significantly reduces their impact on the environment and the habitats of the local wildlife."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Question: A city like Detroit ended up with a lot of abandoned buildings when large amounts of people moved where? - forest - countryside - wilderness - suburbs - on vacation  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer is suburbs. When looking at the history of Detroit, it is important to understand the factors that led to the situation it finds itself in today, with a large number of abandoned buildings and a significantly decreased population. The main reasons behind this phenomenon can be traced back to the decline of the automotive industry, racial tensions, and white flight, which, in combination, resulted in a mass exodus of people from the city and into the suburbs. 1. Decline of the Automotive Industry: Detroit was once known as the \\"Motor City\\" and was the hub of the American automotive industry. However, starting in the latter half of the 20th century, the industry began to face serious competition from foreign manufacturers, leading to a decline in its market share. This, coupled with increased automation and outsourcing, led to a significant decrease in the number of jobs available within the city. As people lost their jobs or sought better opportunities elsewhere, they began to move away from Detroit, leaving behind large numbers of vacant and abandoned buildings. 2. Racial Tensions: Detroit, like many other American cities, has had its fair share of racial tensions throughout history. During the 20th century, the city experienced significant demographic shifts as a result of the Great Migration, with a large number of African Americans moving to the city in search of better economic opportunities. However, as the racial makeup of the city changed, tensions between different racial groups began to grow. This was further exacerbated by the policies of the city and federal government, including redlining practices that reinforced racial segregation. Many white residents began to feel uncomfortable or unsafe in the city and chose to move away, contributing to the phenomenon known as \\"white flight.\\" 3. White Flight and Suburbanization: White flight refers to the large-scale migration of white people from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban areas. Several factors contributed to this movement, including the desire for improved housing and better schools, but one of the principal concerns for many white residents was the growing racial tensions in the city. As a result, they began to move away from the city in search of safer, more comfortable communities. In response to this demand, suburban areas around Detroit began to develop rapidly, offering better housing and amenities for those who could afford to move there. The combination of these factors led to a vicious cycle in Detroit. As more and more people moved away from the city, the population and tax base began to decline, reducing the city's ability to maintain its infrastructure and provide essential services. This, in turn, contributed to the decline of the city's quality of life, prompting even more people to leave. As a result, Detroit ended up with a large number of abandoned buildings, while its suburban neighbors continued to grow and thrive. In conclusion, while there may be multiple factors that contributed to the severe decline of Detroit, the best answer to the question of where large amounts of people moved is the suburbs. This movement was driven by a combination of the decline of the automotive industry, racial tensions within the city, and the phenomenon of white flight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: When a Florida mom was browsing her Facebook, she came across a post from the local police department, trying to identify a shoplifting suspect. She saw the teenager had been caught on camera stealing 670 worth of Playstation controllers from a Target in Casselbury. Then on closer inspection, she realized it was her own son. She then marched into 18-year-old Joel Brown's room at 1am on Wednesday, woke him up and called the police. CCTV footage: Joel Brown's mother was browsing Facebook when she noticed her son was the robbery suspect police were looking to identify in Casselbury, Florida. Sgt.

Officers then arrived and found him wearing the same FILA sweatshirt he was wearing during the alleged robberies. Brown was then arrested. Police said they recovered five of the controllers, but several had already been sold to area GameStop stores. Brown is being held at the Seminole County Jail on a 2,000 bond. He has been charged with retail theft and shoplifting. Pamatian said it was unusual for officers to receive tip-offs from mothers.

He selected two specific eras of human history, era A and era B. Era A was before humans had invented agriculture. And, era B was after the invention of agriculture. He noticed that human societies had changed dramatically after the invention of agriculture.  and a hint : Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  Please answer this question : Which era saw lower death rate, era A or era B? Answer:","output":"Era A, the time before humans had invented agriculture, saw a lower death rate compared to era B, the period after the invention of agriculture. Despite the increased food supply and other advantages in era B, crowded living conditions in villages and cities and the spread of diseases from domestic animals contributed to higher death rates. However, it's important to note that higher birth rates in era B offset the higher death rates, which resulted in a slow population growth overall."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Going back as far as I can remember as a child in an Indian area, I had no senses of knowing about the other people around me except that we were all somehow equal...There was only one class.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Parkway Drive is an Australian metalcore band from Byron Bay, New South Wales, formed in 2003. As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers  drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell  along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200.  - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000.   - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success.  - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\"  - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners.  - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records .  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. The band has released seven studio albums and one DVD. Their latest album, \\"Incarnate\\", was released on March 11, 2016.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen is inhaled happens, how will it affect more carbon dioxide is produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have an effect on the process. If more oxygen is inhaled, this can potentially lead to an increase in the breakdown of glucose in the body, which in turn may result in the production of more carbon dioxide. This is because the increased availability of oxygen might enhance cellular respiration, a process that uses oxygen to break down glucose to produce energy and carbon dioxide as a byproduct. If more carbon dioxide is produced, it will subsequently be exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth.

Options: a ) 81 , b ) 65 , c ) 75 , d ) 89 , e ) 90 A:","output":"We're given that the average weight of a, b, and c is 70 kg. This means the total weight of a, b, and c is 70 * 3 = 210 kg.  When d joins the group, the average weight remains 70 kg. So, the total weight of a, b, c, and d is 70 * 4 = 280 kg. To find the weight of d, we subtract the total weight of a, b, and c (210 kg) from the total weight of a, b, c, and d (280 kg): Weight of d = 280 - 210 = 70 kg Now, we're told e replaces a and has 3 kg more weight than d. So, Weight of e = Weight of d + 3 = 70 + 3 = 73 kg Finally, we know that the average weight of b, c, d, and e is 68 kg. The total weight of these four is therefore 68 * 4 = 272 kg. We know that the total weight of a, b, c, and d is 280 kg, so we can find the weight of a by subtracting the total weight of b, c, and d (280 kg) from the total weight of b, c, d, and e (272 kg), and then adding the weight of e (73 kg). Weight of a = (280 - 272) + 73 = 8 + 73 = 81 kg So, the weight of a is 81 kg, which corresponds to option a."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie plot title: Minotaur Movie plot: Long ago in the Iron Age a shadow loomed over a lonely village of Thens. For every five years, eight village youths are stolen from their families to the capital of the Minos Empire and placed in the underground labyrinth to be a sacrifice to the Minotaur, the Minoan god. Theo, haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice, is convinced that the beast is not a deity and that his love still lives within the labyrinth. His father Cyrnan, the village leader, tries to reason with Theo not to go but Theo is driven by blind rage and made his way in with seven other youths to be sacrifical lambs. However, Theo intends to kill the Minotaur. Along with his fellow captives, Tyro, Danu, Vena, Morna, Didi, Ziko and Cyrnan, they are placed in the labyrinth by King Deucalion, with the youths slaugthered one by one by the Minotaur. However, Theo is aided by Deucalion's sister, Queen Raphaella, who reveals that her mother gave herself to the most disturbing actions to create a living god, the Minotaur. As the Minotaur grows, so does its appetite when it murdered Deucalion's brother, resulting with the human sacrifices to appense the Minotaur while ensuring Minos's surival.Theo along the way discovers the labyrinth is connected to an underground vent and Tyro tempts the Minotaur to crash into one of the vents but is unsuccessful as the Minotaur eats him alive. Theo then tempts the Minotaur and in the process, the Minotaur breaks his left horn, but continues to charge after Theo. As Theo ran back towards the enlarged vent, he scratches the walls and generates a spark that ignites the whole labyrinth, and dives into a pond of water where Raphaella was waiting for him. They emerge from the water as the flames die out, but the beast is still alive and attempts to charge at them again. Theo takes the horn out of the rubble from where the vent was, and just as the beast attempts to kill him, stabs the Minotaur through the mouth and continues on charging until it hits a collapsed rock formation which impales the...

Percy Aldridge Grainger (born George Percy Grainger; 8 July 1882 – 20 February 1961) was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist who lived in the United States from 1914 on and became a citizen in 1918. In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century.  Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year...

Write an article based on this summary: – If you're looking to avoid any link between animal products and your food, you might want to take a hard look at the sugar you consume. Cane sugar undergoes a refining process that makes it white, and the process often involves the use of bone char, which typically comes from cows' pelvic bones, Mother Nature Network reports. (Granulated carbon or an ion exchange system can also be used as filters, notes Vegetarian Journal, but the \\"efficient\\" and \\"economical\\" bone char is the most popular filter.) A process of grinding and then heating them creates the carbon that's used to filter the sugar; a commercial filter can contain as much as 70,000 pounds of char. You aren't actually consuming bone char when you eat the sugar—there's contact, but the end result is free of it—but vegans looking to avoid it need not give up the ingredient. There are a number of animal-free options. If you buy a bag that's certified USDA organic, for instance, bone char won't have been used to make it. Or you can opt for 100% pure beet sugar; its refining process doesn't include char, and the USDA reports that for the last two decades, sugar beets have made up about 55% of domestic sugar production to sugarcane's 45%. Sugar that's labeled \\"raw\\" or \\"unrefined\\" is also a good bet, as is sugar made with \\"evaporated cane juice,\\" MNN notes. Product lists like this one from Ordinary Vegan and this one from PETA can offer some help, too. Things get more complicated when you buy foods that already have sugar in them, since makers might mix different kinds of sugar. (You might want to just try cutting down on sugar, period.)","output":"Title: The Hidden Connection Between Sugar and Animal Products: What Vegans Need to Know Introduction Vegans are continually working to avoid animal products and their byproducts in their daily diets. Yet, there is one surprising ingredient that may pose a challenge to those looking to completely eliminate these products: sugar. Specifically, cane sugar undergoes a refining process that may involve the use of bone char, a substance derived from cows' bones. Bone Char and the Sugar Industry To create bone char, cows' pelvic bones are ground and heated, producing carbon. This carbon then serves as a filter in the sugar refining process. Bone char is favored by sugar manufacturers due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Commercial filters used during this process can contain up to 70,000 pounds of char. It's important to note that you're not actually consuming bone char when you eat sugar filtered by this process. The two substances come into contact, but the refined sugar is free of bone char in the end. Nonetheless, vegans looking to avoid any link to animal products may search for alternatives. Alternative Sugar Options for Vegans 1. USDA Organic Certified Sugar: If you purchase sugar with a USDA Organic certification, it guarantees that bone char wasn't used during the refinement process. 2. 100% Pure Beet Sugar: Opting for 100% pure beet sugar is another animal-free alternative. According to the USDA, sugar beets have accounted for 55% of domestic sugar production over the past two decades. This is largely because beet sugar doesn't undergo refinement processes involving char. 3. Raw or Unrefined Sugar: Sugar labeled as \\"raw\\" or \\"unrefined\\" has not been subjected to a bone char filtration process. 4. Sugar with Evaporated Cane Juice: Similar to raw and unrefined sugars, sugar produced with evaporated cane juice avoids the use of bone char. 5. Consult Vegan Product Lists: Resources from organizations such as Ordinary Vegan and PETA provide lists of vegan-friendly sugar options, ensuring no animal byproducts are involved. Challenges with Pre-made Foods It's essential to be mindful of sugar content in pre-made, processed, or packaged foods. Often, these products contain a mixture of different sugar types, making it difficult to discern the exact source of the sugar. Reducing overall sugar consumption can be beneficial not only for avoiding the possibility of bone char, but also for an individual's overall health. Conclusion When looking for sugar that doesn't involve animal byproducts, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. By keeping a watchful eye on what you consume and opting for organic or vegan-friendly sugar options, you can continue to enjoy sweet treats without compromising your commitment to a vegan lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Now that stereo Bluetooth has become a common feature in a lot of music phones, it's no surprise that stereo Bluetooth headsets have become quite popular as well. Stereo Bluetooth headsets come in many shapes and sizes, from the behind-the-ear style of the Motorola Rokr S9 to the over-the-head style of the Jabra BT8030. The Jabra BT3030 is in the style of a pendant, or as its design suggests, more of a dog tag. It's been available for a while now, but we think it's still worth it. The Jabra BT3030 can be purchased for around 39.99. Of course like any stereo Bluetooth headset, the Jabra BT3030 requires a cell phone with the A2DP or stereo Bluetooth profile. The Jabra BT3030 consists primarily of a small remote control unit housed in a dog-tag style pendant. Measuring 2.1-inches long by 1.6-inch wide by 0.38-inch thick, the pendant is slim and compact with a metal finish and a rubberized border all around it. All of the controls are laid out right on the front face in a straightforward grid. They are the Play/Pause key, the track shuffle keys, the volume controls, plus the multifunction Call key. The keys are all made of rubber, and are raised above the surface for a nice tactile feel. The 3.5mm headset jack is on the right spine, while the charger jack is on the bottom. On the top is an opening for an optional lanyard. Also on the top is a tiny microphone. Getting the headset set up is pretty simple. Just power it on via the multifunction Call button, and turn on the Bluetooth pairing mode on your cell phone. We managed to pair the Jabra BT3030 with the LG Chocolate 3 without a problem. From there, we could play/pause tracks, skip songs, and adjust the volume, all from the Jabra BT3030. The Jabra BT3030 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear, but since it has a 3.5mm headset jack, you can use any headphones of your choosing. Aside from using the Jabra BT3030 for music, you can also use the it to make calls via the last number redial or voice command. When there's an incoming call during music playback, the music will pause and you will hear a ringing tone. You can then hit the Call button to answer the call. After you hang up, the music will resume from the paused point. Other features include call-waiting support, the ability to reject calls, plus the ability to transfer calls from the headset to the phone, and vice versa. Sound quality was quite good, and comparable to most MP3 players on the market. The bass was a little weak, but the overall quality was decent. Call quality was mixed. While we heard our callers just fine, we did have to bring the pendant close to our mouths for callers to hear us. They reported a little bit of static and echo from us as well. This seemed to vary from caller to caller, however, so we urge you to give it a trial run before you settle for it. The Jabra BT3030 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory, plus an AC adapter. It has a rated battery life of 8 hours talk time, 7 hours music streaming, and 9.58 days standby time. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

Article:","output":"Title: SBS Sports Presenter Scott McIntyre Fired Over Controversial Anzac Day Tweets Introduction:  SBS sports presenter Scott McIntyre has recently been terminated from his position following a series of inflammatory tweets on Anzac Day. The Australian broadcaster has deemed these tweets \\"disrespectful\\" and has subsequently taken action to distance themselves from the presenter's comments. Body: Anzac Day, celebrated on April 25th each year, honors the memory of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who served and died during the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. The day also serves as a time to remember and pay tribute to all Australians and New Zealanders who have fought in wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations. It is an incredibly significant day for both nations, consisting of dawn services, marches and memorial events to honor the fallen and their sacrifices. Scott McIntyre garnered attention and criticism when he posted a series of contentious tweets on Anzac Day, which many perceived to be discrediting and undermining the sacrifices made by the Australian armed forces. While the specifics of the tweets have not been disclosed, the public backlash was strong and swift, leading SBS to release an official statement condemning the remarks and announcing McIntyre's termination. SBS Managing Director, Michael Ebeid, expressed the network's stance on the issue, stating that McIntyre's tweets were \\"disrespectful\\" and \\"inappropriate.\\" He emphasized the importance of respecting and honoring the bravery and sacrifice made by servicemen and women, as well as the pain and suffering experienced by their families and loved ones. Ebeid further added, \\"At SBS, while we appreciate and encourage diverse opinions and viewpoints, we also expect our presenters to uphold a certain level of professionalism and respect for the values we as a nation hold dear.\\" Scott McIntyre's termination has sparked debates surrounding free speech and the boundaries of acceptable commentary by public figures, specifically in regards to national events and observances. While some argue that McIntyre's dismissal may be seen as an infringement upon his rights to express his opinions, others assert that as a public figure and representative of SBS, he held a responsibility to exercise caution and tact when commenting on sensitive subjects. Conclusion: The dismissal of SBS sports presenter Scott McIntyre over his controversial tweets on Anzac Day has undoubtedly ignited conversations about the complexities of free speech and the responsibilities public figures carry. As the nation reflects on the sacrifices of the past and the significance of Anzac Day, the incident serves as a reminder of the critical need for respect and understanding, both in personal commentary and public discourse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: While Horowitz welcomes the work for the union's 300,000 members, she is concerned about how the growing reliance on freelancers will impact the overall economy. Because freelance work can be uncertain, Horowitz maintains these people are less likely to spend what they earn, saving their money for when work dries up. \\"If we don't address the No. 1 issue of episodic income and risk, we are not going to see a recovery about consumption,\\" Horowitz said, suggesting this has long-term implications for economic growth as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of GDP. Horowitz said as freelancers become an increasingly important part of the workforce, the government may have to step in with programs that would help them maintain a more stable income. She speculates we might see the government set up some kind of a tax-free account where freelancers could stash funds to be accessed when they are not working. Having a safety net like that, Hororwitz believes, could go a long way in making freelance work a more attractive option for people who are still focused on working full time for a company.

Context: The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Article: You may have noticed that chokers are all the rage this season.  They come in all different widths, colors, and materials, but one of the most popular is the classic velvet choker.  These iconic ‘90s pieces look great out on the town at night, but they’re also doable in the daytime.  Pair them with a flowy daytime dress or slouchy sweater to look easygoing but also on-trend and put-together. A narrower width will be more subtle than broader versions.  You can even find chokers that mimic bolo ties or ribbons, creating a longer line that doesn’t read as such a bold choker-choice. Velvet ankle booties combine luxe sophistication with a retro rock n roll attitude.  And, since they’re a relatively small part of your ensemble, they can be a good way to ease into the velvet trend.  Pair them with some skinny jeans or boot-cut trousers to highlight the lush velvet while remaining casual and cool. You’ll find that most velvet booties have platforms or chunky heels, so you might want to look for a different velvet accessory if you’re uncomfortable with heels. Chokers might be the most popular velvet accessory, but they're not the only ones available.  In fact, you can find a wide variety of hair accessories and jewelry in velvet, such as headbands, retro scrunchies, cuff bracelets, and baseball caps.  Since these components are fairly small, you can incorporate them into almost any casual outfit without feeling like you're making a fashion statement. Don't forget about handbags!  Even though you might not wear them on your body in the same way that you wear a dress or a hat, they can constitute important and attention-grabbing elements of your ensemble.  Velvet clutches and backpacks are particularly in vogue at the moment, as well as small, cross-body purses and pocketbooks. If you want to incorporate some velvet into your outfit without committing to a whole piece, look for jackets, belts, or bottoms with some velvet accents.  A velvet trim on a dress or blouse, a velvet ribbon or stripe around the waist of a blazer, or velvet buttons on a jacket can all add flair to your ensemble while remaining subtle and casual. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about different ways you can wear velvet accessories. Velvet chokers, that can be worn day or night, are really popular right now. You can have broad ones or narrow ones, and some can even look like ties or ribbons.

If you don't want to wear a choker or boots, you can find many other velvet items like headbands, scrunchies, bracelets, and hats. Even handbags can be a nice velvet touch to your outfit. If you like the idea of velvet but don't want too much, you can find clothes with little velvet details on them like a trim or buttons.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the UEFA Champions League group stages, a prestigious football competition in Europe, which will feature two high-profile football figures - Jose Mourinho and Henrik Larsson. Both individuals are known for their illustrious careers in European football and hold significant connections with their former clubs. Due to the draw of the group stages, they will return to their respective old stomping grounds, the clubs or stadiums where they had great success, sooner than they may have anticipated. Jose Mourinho, a seasoned manager best known for his tactical acumen and numerous accomplishments, has managed top clubs such as FC Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. His return to an old stomping ground implies that the group stage draw has put the team he is managing at the moment against one of his former clubs. Henrik Larsson, on the other hand, was a highly skilled Swedish footballer who had notable stints at clubs like Helsingborg, Feyenoord, Celtic, and Barcelona. His remarkable goalscoring ability made him well-respected in European football. The mention of his old stomping grounds suggests that the team he may be involved with, either as a player or in a coaching capacity, will face one or more of the clubs he adorns in his career history during the Champions League group stages.

This often involves setting realistic yet demanding goals and engaging in deliberate practice that focuses on enhancing specific aspects of the skill. Through this process, you gradually increase your proficiency and overcoming obstacles that may have hindered your progress earlier. Here are some ways to stretch yourself in skill development: 1. Identify areas for improvement: This requires reflecting on your current abilities, recognizing weaknesses, and crafting a plan to tackle these shortcomings. 2. Break the skill into smaller components: Dissecting the skill into manageable parts helps you focus on specific aspects, which can make improvement more achievable and measurable. 3. Emphasize deliberate practice: Deliberate practice is intentional and focused on addressing weaknesses. It often involves working on specific tasks or exercises that are designed to strengthen your abilities in those areas. 4. Seek feedback: Constructive criticism from mentors or peers can guide you in modifying your approach and determining whether your efforts are yielding results. 5. Monitor progress: Keeping track of your progress allows you to assess your improvements and make adjustments as needed. It also serves as an incentive to keep pushing forward. 6. Stay persistent and patient: Improving skills often takes time and dedication. Stay determined in your pursuit of growth, despite setbacks and plateaus along the way.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Options:  A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them  B. not enough information  C. when one is able to acquire produce in bulk  D. after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","output":"A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, use your hands to rub the scrub into your knees. After rubbing for about 30 seconds, let the scrub sit on your knees for 5 minutes before rinsing it off with water. Using an exfoliating mixture on your skin helps to remove dead skin cells, which can make the skin appear lighter and brighter. Add equal parts baking soda and lemon juice to a small bowl, and stir them until a paste forms. Use your hands to rub the paste into your knees for about 1 minute, and then rinse with water. Both baking soda and lemon juice work well as natural lightening agents for many people, and the grittiness of the baking soda helps to exfoliate your skin. Both of these can help to make dark skin look lighter over time. Every night, apply 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of almond oil to your knees. Make sure your knees are coated with the oil, and then cover them with a strip of fabric or a towel overnight. While almond oil is a natural lightener, it will also add moisture to your skin, which helps to reduce darkness by making the skin more supple. Mix 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of plain yogurt with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of freshly extracted aloe gel. Use a spatula to apply the mask to your knees, and let it sit for 15-30 minutes. Then, rinse your knees with water.  Aloe has been proven as a natural healing for scars in a number of studies.  To extract aloe gel from the leaves of an aloe plant, simply cut the leaf off of the plant and slice down the center of the leaf. Then, use a spoon to scoop the gel out of the leaf. If you don’t have fresh aloe gel available, you can purchase pure aloe from most pharmacies or supermarkets. If you don’t want to make a scrub, you can use a physical exfoliator like a loofah or sponge to scrub away the dead skin cells. Purchase one at your local supermarket, pharmacy, or beauty supply store, and use it to wash your body in the shower, scrubbing each of your knees for at least 30 seconds. Physical exfoliation with a loofah, sponge, or gentle pumice stone is a common treatment for the symptoms of psoriasis and other dry-skin conditions.

The first: he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction. The second: he is partnered with detective Henry Oak (Ray Liotta), whom Tellis is aware of through reading the files on Calvess' death. Tellis' reason for wanting Oak is his opinion that the only useful evidence in the investigation came from him. The department chief informs Tellis of Oak's reputation as a driven and effective policeman, but also warns him about his instability. Despite his reservations, Oak is assigned to the case.

Information:  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Trachyglanis is a genus of loach catfishes from Africa .  - The loach catfishes are a family, Amphiliidae, of catfishes (order Siluriformes). They are widespread in tropical Africa, but are most common in streams at high elevations; most species are able to cling to rocks in fast-flowing streams. The 13 genera contain 68 species.

Negative:  \\"Disheartened Dreams\\" - A Short Film Review \\"Disheartened Dreams\\" is an indie short film that had the potential to create an emotional connection with its audience but ultimately missed the mark. Despite the filmmakers' attempt to depict the raw struggle of pursuing one's ambitions, they fell short in developing a cohesive plot and engaging characters. The film follows the protagonist, Sarah, as she tirelessly auditions for various acting roles only to face repeated rejection. While the core premise showcases the harsh realities faced by many aspiring actors, the short film's meager runtime fails to cultivate any genuine empathy towards the character. Rather than delving deeper into Sarah's psyche and exploring her character traits, the film offers a superficial representation of a much broader issue, leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and detached from the narrative. Furthermore, the poor execution of visual storytelling is evident throughout the film in the form of awkward camera angles, abrupt cuts, and an inconsistent color palette. These technical shortcomings hinder the viewers' ability to engage with the story and cast a profound impact on the overall cinematic experience. In terms of performance, the lead actress struggles to deliver a genuine portrayal of despair and hopelessness, further contributing to the film's lackluster sentiment. The lack of chemistry between Sarah and the secondary characters does little to support the emotionally charged theme, making it difficult to become invested in their onscreen relationships. Finally, the film's score often feels misplaced and overbearing, detracting from crucial scenes and at times, overshadowing the dialogues. Rather than complementing the film's theme of heartache and resilience, the score distracts the audience and waters down the intended effect. In conclusion, \\"Disheartened Dreams\\" attempted to create a compelling narrative around the harsh realities of chasing one's aspirations but ultimately faltered due to weak character development, technical flaws, and insufficient runtime. With a more thoughtful approach to storytelling and a stronger commitment to production quality, the filmmakers might have been able to deliver a more resonant and impactful film worthy of the poignant subject matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The main symptoms of giardiasis are abdominal cramps and bloating, flatulence (gas) and watery foul-smelling diarrhea that may alternate with soft, greasy stools. As such, you shouldn't get too far from a bathroom because you'll need one frequently throughout the day for at least 2 weeks and maybe as long as 6 weeks while your body combats the infection.  The bloating and cramps may make it difficult to walk, so don't plan on any hikes or being too active until you're back to full health. Consider postponing any holidays if you get giardiasis because you'll likely be too uncomfortable to enjoy the trip. If you're out of your house shopping or doing errands, always carry some wet wipes in case you have to use a toilet that doesn't have any toilet paper. The Giardia parasite survives outside the body within feces (poop) as spores. These hard spores can live almost anywhere for long periods of time until they get ingested via contaminated water, food or from someone's unwashed hands. The spores then hatch in your stomach or small intestine and cause infection. Washing your hands after going to the bathroom will prevent you from getting re-infected and infecting your friends and family.  Be especially careful washing your hands after changing diapers or picking up pet feces. Always make a habit of washing your hands with soap and water before eating or preparing food. While sick with the symptoms of giardiasis, resting is important because it'll allow your immune system more energy to fight off the infection. You'll likely be very tired due to the nausea, diarrhea and lack of appetite (which severely limits your eating), so taking some naps during the day shouldn't be difficult to do. Your immune system tends to kick it into \\"high gear\\" when you sleep. Some walking and light housework is fine, but take a break from the gym and other vigorous physical activities until you feel much better and stronger. Since a primary symptom of giardiasis is moderate-to-severe diarrhea, dehydration from fluid loss is always a concern. As such, replenishing your fluids throughout the day is important, so aim for at least 64 ounces of purified water (eight 8-ounce glasses). If you're very nauseous and having trouble keeping liquids down, try taking small sips of water or sucking on ice chips.  In addition to water, drinking some fresh fruit / veggie juice is important to replenish your electrolytes (mineral salts), which are lost with diarrhea and vomiting. You can add a pinch of salt and half a teaspoon of honey or one teaspoon of sugar to an eight ounce glass of fruit juice. This will make your fluid replacement even easier to tolerate. Avoid fizzy drinks and anything with alcohol or caffeine until you're feeling healthy. Symptoms of dehydration include: dry mouth, thirst, tiredness, headache, dizziness, reduced urination and increased heartbeat.  Children with diarrhea are more susceptible to dehydration than adults are. Hydration is a really important part of managing mild diarrhea. If you can't intake all the hydration you need orally, you may need an IV to help replenish your fluids. If you think that you may need an IV, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. You need energy to fight off the parasitic infection and to be able to go about your day, but the nausea and abdominal cramps from giardiasis can greatly diminish your appetite. As such, ease back into eating with small meals (or snacks) spaced throughout the day. Eat bland, low-fat and easy to digest foods, such as crackers, toast, soup broth, bananas and rice. Don't eat during waves of nausea.  Until you're feeling better, avoid fried foods, fatty and overly spicy foods. Avoid dairy products because you may have some degree of lactose intolerance that aggravates intestinal symptoms caused by giardiasis. Don't eat too much fresh fruit or veggies (especially cauliflower, onions and cabbage), because it can lead to even more gas, bloating and abdominal cramping. Snack on foods that can help your body get rid of parasites, such as pumpkin seeds, pomegranates, papaya, beets and carrots. There are a number of herbs that have anti-parasitic properties, which means they can inhibit the spread of parasites in your body or actually kill them outright. Effective examples include barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, anise seed, wormwood, curled mint and black walnuts. These anti-parasitic herbs are usually taken as tinctures under the tongue or diluted in some water. Taking them in capsules or using them to make herbal teas can work too.  Other herbs sometimes used to kill parasites include grapefruit seed extract, fresh cloves, olive leaf extract and garlic. Some herbs used to treat intestinal parasites can interfere with certain medications, so use them only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.","output":"This article discusses the symptoms, prevention, and management of giardiasis, a parasitic infection causing abdominal cramps, bloating, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues, emphasizing the importance of proper hydration, rest, and careful diet choices to aid recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Killed: Mechanic Stephan Hollow (pictured) was named by his neighbours as the victim of the knife attack just yards from his doorstep. A father was stabbed to death after rushing to the aid of his son, as an early morning argument spiralled into a murder. Mechanic Stephan Hollow was named by his neighbours as the victim of the knife attack just yards from his doorstep.

She said: 'There was a bit of a party going on in the back garden and they were all having a few drinks. 'From what I gather, one of Ty’s friends got into a fight with Steph and I saw them all outside with their tops off throwing a few punches. 'I heard Ty saying ‘look Dad let’s stop it’ and they all then went indoors. Then, half an hour later, as my other half was coming in I saw Ty pelt it out of the house and run up the road. 'I woke up at 6am to see all of the police tape around and heard Steph had been killed. It’s just awful. He is a mechanic and everyone knows him around here because of that.' Investigation: Armed police raid at an address in Basingstoke, Hampshire in connection with the fatal stabbing of Stephan Hollow which took place in the early hours of this morning. Police had descended to the bloody death scene at Blackdown Close, Basingstoke, Hampshire. Scenes of crimes officers were seen looking for clues in a car park at the back of the flats, which was cordoned off to the public. There was blood on the floor next to a blue Suzuki jeep, which was towed away by police for analysis. Armed police swooped on a house just five minutes walk from the murder scene at 6.30am, according to neighbours. Officers. swamped Dorset Crescent bearing rifles and side arms and searched the. property, where it was believed a mother and 18-year-old son live. A neighbour, said: 'At 6.30am I opened my curtains to be greeted by loads of armed police. 'There were seven police cars and officers with rifles and hand guns outside the house across from us. They were looking for someone. They were in the house and in the cornfield opposite with dogs and guns. 'I. don’t know if anyone was arrested. I didn’t see if they got anyone. It. was quite an alarming thing to see first thing in the morning. Probe: A 27-year-old man is in police custody following the fatal attack. Police are pictured at a house nearby as their investigations continue today. 'I know a mother and her teenage son live there but I don’t know them because they only moved in about six weeks ago.' Today, a Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm the victim is in his 50s and from Basingstoke. The arrested man is a 27-year-old from Basingstoke. He remains in police custody.' A neighbour who knew Mr Hollow well said: 'He seemed like a nice guy. He would always have a chat with you. I never heard him say a bad word about anybody. I cannot believe that this sort of thing has happened. It seems so pointless.' A young woman from the area said: 'His family are grieving. They are in shock.' Tributes flooded into Facebook as news of the tragic death spread. Marie Perry wrote: 'Lovely guy brilliant smile, our love and thoughts are with you all right now.' Meanwhile, Ryan Houston wrote: 'So sorry to hear the tragic news. Our thoughts are with you all.'

Leicester Crown Court heard she deleted a record of phone calls made during her journey in November 2014. George, a nurse, will be sentenced on 15 July. The court has heard George's Skoda hit a lorry which crashed through to the northbound carriageway, spilling its load of beer barrels and hitting a BMW travelling in the opposite direction. The collision closed the road for 18 hours, a jury was told. The BMW driver, Murray Simpson, from London, died in the crash, while another driver - Liese Bowers-Straw - broke her neck in two places and suffered brain and head injuries. George, who was driving to a Coventry hospital to work a night shift, had denied causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice, but was found guilty of all charges after a trial. Leicestershire Police said during her journey, George made phone calls to a friend and her husband. The court heard the calls George made involved unlocking and pressing icons on her iPhone to connect the calls, but she said she spoke and listened through a hands-free speaker system. She said the use of her phone was a \\"one-off incident\\" which does not represent her usual driving habits. \\"We're pleased that the jury has found Christy George guilty and we hope it acts as a deterrent to other road users,\\" Det Con Pete Davies said. \\"Murray Simpson's partner and family have lost a loved one and while no amount of punishment will help them move on...we hope the fact that someone has been prosecuted for their actions will show them that justice has been done.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"A lady named Christy George was driving her car on the M1 when her car hit a lorry.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Who was the leader who realized the commercial value of the port\\" Response: \\"Paramsekwana did\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the exact title of the portrait featuring the children of Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton?  In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

But sadly, many of us don't actually get the real meaning of these lines: Don't waste food. A CCTV program reported that the food Chinese people throw away every year is enough to feed 200 million people for a year. Do we have too much food? Absolutely not. According to the UN World Food Program, there were 925 million hungry people around the world in 2011, especially in developing countries. Six million children die of hunger every year. Chinese people are well-known for being friendly and generous. Many even feel that they lose face if their guests have eaten all the food on the table. Luckily, a number of people have realized the importance of saving food. What should we do in our daily lives to waste less food? 1. Don't order too much in a restaurant. Only order as much as you want to eat. If you cannot eat all the food you ordered, take the rest of it home. 2. Don't leave any food in your bowls while having meals. 3. Keep an eye on what food you have at home. Don't buy too much, especially for vegetables and fruit. Question: What should we do to waste less food? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Don't store too much food like vegetables and fruit.\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Don't store too much food like vegetables and fruit.\\" aligns with one of the suggestions given in the article on how to waste less food.

Avoiding leaving food in your bowls after meals. 3. Monitoring the food you have at home and avoiding over-purchasing, particularly when it comes to perishables like vegetables and fruits.  These recommendations in the article aim to tackle the issue of food waste, emphasized by the startling statistics from the UN World Food Program, and promote a more responsible and sustainable approach to food consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the one hand, his revolutionary process for creating synthetic fertilizers averted the greatest overpopulation crisis the world has ever known, won him the Nobel Prize in 1918, and now feeds over 2 billion people. But Haber was also a staunch German patriot who loved his country with an almost blinding loyalty. Born and raised Jewish, his longing to be accepted as a true German and his intense ambition in his career led him to convert to Lutheranism and abandon his faith.

As Haber agonized over the decision, his wife, Clara, a chemist herself who had sacrificed her own career to support his, implored him not to go through with it. But Haber, his opportunity to become a true German hero finally at hand, agreed to help the militaryâand became the father of modern chemical warfare.

Craig wanted to get acupuncture but William thought it was foolish.  OPT: A). Craig was a big skeptic of alternative medicine.. B). William was a big skeptic of alternative medicine..","output":"B). William was a big skeptic of alternative medicine. William argued that there was no substantial scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture. Craig, on the other hand, claimed that although there might not be sufficient studies, testimonials of people who've experienced positive outcomes couldn't be completely disregarded. Step 1: Establish the basis of both characters' opinions and their willingness to discuss the topic. Craig had done his research online and read multiple positive accounts of people who had found pain relief and other health benefits from acupuncture sessions. He felt that their experiences were enough to convince him to give it a try. Step 2: Introduce the protagonists' conflicting viewpoints. William, being a firm believer in traditional medicine and the scientific method, countered Craig's arguments by stating that anecdotal evidence shouldn't be taken as the definitive proof of a treatment's effectiveness. He urged Craig to consider trying conventional treatments first before venturing into something unproven. Step 3: Escalate the tension and disagreement between the two characters, emphasizing the contrast in their perspectives. Despite William's attempts to dissuade Craig, he remained adamant about trying acupuncture. Craig believed that people's experiences had a lot of weight, and he couldn't just ignore the testimonials. William, frustrated with Craig's stubbornness, questioned why Craig was even considering something that not all doctors and medical institutions recognized as a legitimate treatment. Step 4: Bring the characters to the point of resolution. Seeing that they had reached a deadlock, Craig decided to agree to disagree. He acknowledged that William's perspective had merit and that everyone had different ways of approaching their health and well-being. However, he expressed his determination to try acupuncture at least once, and if it didn't work, he would consider other conventional treatments. Step 5: Wrap up the story, leaving the possibility of future discussions or events. Although still skeptical, William reluctantly accepted Craig's decision. Both friends agreed to continue discussing their differing views on alternative and traditional medicine in the future. Craig felt grateful for William's concern, but the numerous positive accounts of acupuncture had already left an indelible mark on his mind. It was time to see for himself if the ancient practice could truly deliver the benefits others claimed. And so, with a mix of excitement and trepidation, Craig scheduled his first acupuncture appointment, wondering if this alternative treatment would finally provide the relief he had been seeking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Winnie Madikizela are the first names of the ex-wife of which iconic leader?","output":"Winnie Madikizela refers to the first names of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the ex-wife of the iconic leader, Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela was an anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who went on to become the first black president of South Africa. He was a key figure in the struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa, promoting racial equality and creating a more inclusive society. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was also an important political figure in her own right, being the former wife of Nelson Mandela and a strong anti-apartheid activist. She was born on September 26, 1936, in Bizana, Pondoland District, Eastern Cape, South Africa, and died on April 2, 2018, in Johannesburg, South Africa. Winnie and Nelson Mandela got married in 1958, and their relationship remained strong during Nelson Mandela’s imprisonment from 1963 to 1990. During this time, Winnie played an essential role in campaigning for her husband's release and raising international awareness about apartheid. Besides her unwavering support for Nelson Mandela, she was actively involved in political activities and protests against the apartheid government. She took on leadership roles within the African National Congress (ANC), which was the political party that stood against apartheid and spearheaded the struggle for a democratic South Africa. Winnie continued to support the people while her husband was incarcerated, giving voice to the Black South Africans and fighting for their rights. However, Winnie's political career was not without controversy. She was convicted on multiple occasions, including charges relating to kidnapping and being an accessory to assault. These convictions, along with allegations of human rights abuses, tarnished her reputation in the later years of her life. Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, and South Africa transitioned to a democratic government in 1994 with Nelson as the country's first black president. However, the couple's relationship had deteriorated by that time, and they formally separated in 1992, with their divorce being finalized in 1996. In conclusion, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was the ex-wife of the iconic leader Nelson Mandela, and she played a significant role in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. She was a fierce activist, political figure, and leader who tirelessly campaigned for political and social change throughout her life. Despite the controversies surrounding her later years, she remained an influential and inspirational figure in the fight against racial inequality and injustice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Adam, a medical student, is lured to a cabin far from civilization where he volunteers to be repeatedly killed and reanimated by Dr. Franklin Vick, through use of a mysterious serum. While \\"Subject Two\\" as he is initially successful, he begins to experience violent seizures and excruciating pain, begging Vick to kill him or committing suicide several times. Adam eventually gains complete immortality and near instantaneous regeneration, but as a consequence he loses the very sense of being alive; he can no longer feel things (including pain) and no longer can have emotions. His eyes turn snow white, and, to compensate for the gradual loss of his sense of self, he becomes violent and depressed, going so far as to kill a hunter that accidentally shoots him rather than risk him exposing the project. Eventually the student leaves Vick, only to become a walking ghost doomed to walk the earth for eternity.

Traherne Answer:","output":"Title: The Secret Identity of Lord Pengallan Genre: Adventure, Mystery, Drama In the coastal town of Tresswich, England during the mid-19th century, our story unfolds around a series of mysterious events, the heart of which is an enigmatic man by the name of Lord Pengallan (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), a wealthy and influential resident of the town. Despite being well-known and respected in the community, there is a cloud of mystique surrounding Pengallan, as very few people truly know about his past or much about his personal life. The protagonist of our story is the charming and determined detective, Richard Traherne (played by Tom Hardy), who hails from London and arrives in Tresswich on the request of a young woman named Emily (played by Emma Watson). Emily, who has recently inherited the local inn from her recently deceased father, has become increasingly concerned about the suspicious activities she has observed around the town. She believes that there may be a secret society of smugglers with sinister intentions operating within the community and fears for her life after a series of veiled threats. Thrilled by the prospect of solving such an enigmatic case, Traherne immediately commences his investigations, blending in with the locals and seeking information. As he unravels the town's numerous secrets, Traherne encounters several intriguing characters with mysterious intentions, all somehow connected to Lord Pengallan. This includes a self-proclaimed priest, who is questioned by the townspeople due to a lack of verifiable references (played by Daniel Radcliffe), and a cunning merchant by the name of Marcus (played by Idris Elba) who seems to have an uncanny knowledge of the town's secret activities. As Traherne grows closer to uncovering the truth behind the rumors of smuggling and conspiracy, he faces numerous obstacles and near-death experiences. It is in the climax of the movie that Traherne uncovers that Lord Pengallan himself is the mastermind behind the secret smuggling operations. Lord Pengallan, who has been watching Traherne's investigation closely throughout the story, eventually decides to reveal himself and his intentions to Traherne in a final confrontation. In a dramatic and intense scene, Pengallan tells Traherne that these illegal activities were designed to actually benefit the town by providing valuable resources and support, unbeknownst to the townspeople. He explains that his family has followed this tradition for generations, using their wealth to help those in need. However, with the death of Emily's father – who was once Pengallan's loyal ally in these operations – smuggling activities were exposed, though Pengallan's involvement remained a secret. Traherne, faced with this surprising revelation, must decide whether to enforce the law and arrest Pengallan or to empathize with his motives and help him to operate in a more discreet and legal way. Ultimately, Traherne agrees to aid Pengallan in devising a new plan to support the town without resorting to illegal activities. With Traherne's guidance, Pengallan transforms his smuggling ring into a legitimate enterprise, establishing a trade company that provides employment and much-needed resources for the town. The movie ends with Pengallan expressing his gratitude to Traherne, but the bond formed during their collaboration is cut short as Traherne must return to London. However, he leaves with a renewed sense of purpose and accomplishment, knowing he has brought change and justice to the town of Tresswich. Lord Pengallan's actions have not gone unnoticed, and the town remains eternally grateful to their enigmatic benefactor, whose motives were finally revealed to only one man – Richard Traherne."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],E={key:0},q={key:1};function R(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
