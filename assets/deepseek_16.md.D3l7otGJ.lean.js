Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: very dead  B: a very good swimmer  C: very saved A:","output":"In this context, where Remy saves Austin's life after he falls into the water, the most appropriate answer would be C: very saved. Allow me to elaborate on the reasoning behind this choice. First and foremost, Austin would likely feel incredibly grateful and relieved, given that Remy prevented a potentially life-threatening situation. By pulling Austin out of the water, Remy's actions reassured him that he was no longer in danger. Therefore, \\"very saved\\" captures the essence of Austin's emotions in the aftermath of the incident. Answer A (\\"very dead\\") is not applicable in this situation, as Austin's life was indeed saved. Moreover, even if this question were not tied to the given context, \\"very dead\\" would not accurately reflect a person's emotions or feelings; rather, it relates to one's physical state. Answer B (\\"a very good swimmer\\") is also an unsuitable response for several reasons. Firstly, it has not been specified whether Austin can swim or not; his falling into the water could be due to any number of factors. In addition, even if Austin were an exceptional swimmer, his feelings would not be directed towards his swimming capabilities, but rather his gratitude towards Remy for saving his life. From the context provided, Austin's swimming ability is irrelevant to the question of how he would feel following the experience. In summary, option C (\\"very saved\\") is the most suitable answer to the question of how Austin would feel as a result of Remy saving his life in this context. Beyond merely capturing Austin's relief and gratitude, this answer also places emphasis on the fact that Remy was instrumental in preventing potential harm from befalling Austin."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From 1976 to 1983, several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 (or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat drunk driving fatalities. In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment.

Passage:On June 6, 1861, he was promoted major of the 6th US Infantry, and on Aug. 22 of that year he received the colonelcy of the 8th Kansas Infantry. After serving on the Missouri border he resumed his commission in the regular army Feb. 15, 1862, and in March was transferred to the Army of the Potomac. He was made a brigadier-general of volunteers April 25 and served in the Peninsula, receiving the regular army brevet of lieutenant- colonel for gallantry at the Battle of Fair Oaks, where he was wounded. In Gen. George B. McClellan's change of base he commanded the rear-guard, and then engaged in the defense of Suffolk, Va., afterward serving in North Carolina. After serving at Kinston, Goldsboro, and New Berne, he was placed over the sub-district of the Albemarle, taking command May 3, 1863. On April 17, 1864, he was attacked at Plymouth, North Carolina, where he had a garrison of about 3,000 men, by Gen. Robert F. Hoke with about 15,000 Confederate troops and the iron-clad CSS Albemarle After a gallant defense which lasted three days Gen. Wessells surrendered the town. He was taken to Libby Prison, whence he was transferred successively to Danville, Macon and Charleston. At the last-named place he was one of the officers that were placed under the fire of the Union batteries on Morris island. On Aug. 3, 1864, he was exchanged, and on Nov. 11 he became commissary of prisoners, which post he held until the close of the war. He was also placed in charge of a conscription center in New York. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel Feb. 16, 1865, and brevetted colonel to date from April 20, 1864, \\"for gallant and meritorious services during the rebel attack on Plymouth, N. C.\\" On March 13 he was given the regular army brevet of brigadier general. Output:","output":"Part #1: Determine the year Wessells was promoted to major of the 6th US Infantry. Usage: In the input passage, it is mentioned that \\"On June 6, 1861, he was promoted major of the 6th US Infantry.\\" Therefore, Wessells was promoted to major in 1861. This meets the criteria because the year is directly stated in the passage. Part #2: Understand the context of Libby Prison. Usage: In the passage, it's mentioned that \\"He was taken to Libby Prison, whence he was transferred successively to Danville, Macon and Charleston.\\" This portion gives the information about Libby Prison, but it does not provide the exact period of how long Libby Prison been in existence. However, this part helps to get an understanding of where Libby Prison is mentioned in the passage. Part #3: Identify if information from more than one term is needed to answer the question. Usage: In this case, the answer to the question \\"How long had Libby Prison been in existence for by the year Wessells was promoted to major of the 6th US Infantry?\\" can be determined by looking at the year Wessells was promoted (Part #1) and the context of Libby Prison (Part #2). Since the information can be extracted only from Part #1 but the context of Libby Prison is not enough to determine the exact period of Libby Prison's existence, the answer to this question should be \`b\` (No).

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: To discipline means to teach. To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who take the photographer to the mansion? from the following article ?  Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day. Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him.  Back on the estate, Jason's sister, Iris Martindale sends her son, Kenneth into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. As he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. The geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him. Seeing the danger posed by the animals, Pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but Jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday.

Article: Assimilating to a culture’s ways is a very important part of feeling like you fit in and feeling “at home.” Embrace their traditions and etiquette to get a feel for their way of life and to truly experience the country. However, if something doesn’t make sense to you, don’t do it! You still have your own mind. No culture is better than any other, and therefore their way of life doesn't necessarily have to be adopted. Take traffic rules, for example. If you see a pedestrian timidly crossing the street, you may wish to resist that Brazilian influence growing inside of you and let him or her pass. Never compromise safety or your happiness just to fit in. Going to Brazil on your own can, at least initially, be very daunting. To make the transition easier, find other expats to help pad the culture shock. They are going through the same thing, or have at one point or another. They can point you to all the wonderful \\"bits of home\\" they've cultivated. Brazil is huge and multicultural – you'll be able to find certain comforts (brand names, certain foods, etc.) if you know where to look. In addition to expat friends, you need native friends, too, to show you the ropes. They’ll know all the happening spots, the best places to get food, and show you a side of the country that expats aren’t able to. They'll be the ones that give you the most memorable stories, too. Don't know where to start? You can meet people hanging out at cafes, clubs, at futbol games, or through your students if you teach them your language. What's more, some families love taking in foreigners. Next time a friendly looking older woman smiles at you, initiate a conversation just by saying hello and asking her name. You may be a few minutes away from a home-cooked meal! Many expats take trips back home often, or at least take many opportunities to travel. The pollution may get to you if you're in a bigger city, so you’ll literally need some fresh air!  Listen to your body and mind – when are things starting to get to you? It’s then that you need to take a break from life – that way you can come back rejuvenated and ready to go. If Brazil does start getting to you, sleep on it. Don't write it off quite yet. Sometimes homesickness seems like it's staying forever, but it can be fought through. The rewards, stories, and memories will be virtually limitless if you stay! What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of assimilating to a new culture when moving to a foreign country like Brazil, while still maintaining one's own identity.

In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. It may be considered the foreground to the background accompaniment. A line or part need not be a foreground melody.  - In vocal jazz, scat singing is vocal improvisation with wordless vocables, nonsense syllables or without words at all. Scat singing is a difficult technique that requires singers with the ability to sing improvised melodies and rhythms using the voice as an instrument rather than a speaking medium.  - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest.

I can use this background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

This article delves into the chilling tactics employed by the couple and the tragic events that unfolded as a result of their cold-hearted scheme. Murder of Mark Emanuel Spencer Mark Emanuel Spencer, a beloved member of the Gold Coast community, was found bludgeoned to death at his own home.

Upon further investigation, it was revealed that Spencer had responded to an advertisement for sex on the popular classified website Craigslist, not knowing that it was the bait laid out by his killers. Arrests and Revelations A 33-year-old mother of three and her 28-year-old partner were swiftly arrested on Wednesday after the gruesome murder for their participation in this elaborate scheme. Both have been charged with the heinous crime, and they now remain in custody for their alleged roles in the deadly plot. As the police delved deeper into the case, they found that this couple had been deliberately using the website Craigslist to lure unsuspecting victims in their bid to rob them.

The police are investigating the possibility that other individuals have fallen prey to the duo's wicked tactics. The couple worked in tandem to formulate the potentially embarrassing situations that their victims would be placed in, all in the name of personal gain. Once an individual responded to the deceptive advertisement on Craigslist, the couple would proceed to rob the unsuspecting victims, often using physical violence in the process. Due to the sensitive nature of the encounters, the victims would be hesitant to report the incidents to the police, thus allowing the couple to continue their devious pursuits. A Community Mourns & Seeks Change The tragic and senseless murder of Mark Emanuel Spencer in this twisted plot has left his family, friends, and the entire Gold Coast community in complete shock and mourning. As the area comes to terms with this devastating loss, many questions remain unanswered, and a sense of disbelief lingers. This horrifying event has shed light on the potential dangers present within online platforms like Craigslist and has prompted the community to evaluate the security measures in place. It serves as a poignant reminder that caution and vigilance are essential when connecting with strangers through the anonymous landscape of the internet. Conclusion The cold-blooded murder of Mark Emanuel Spencer at the hands of a manipulative couple has sent shockwaves through the Gold Coast community.

What nickname refers to followers of Sun Myung Moon?","output":"The nickname \\"Moonies\\" refers to the followers of Sun Myung Moon, a Korean religious leader who founded the Unification Church in 1954. The term is derived from Moon's surname and is often used by outsiders, including the media, to describe members of the church. The Unification Church is also commonly called the \\"Moon Church\\" due to its association with Sun Myung Moon. The Unification Church has its roots in Christianity but mixes elements from other religious traditions as well. It teaches that Jesus Christ's mission was left incomplete following his crucifixion, and that Sun Myung Moon was commissioned by God to continue and complete Jesus' work in establishing the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. The followers believe that Sun Myung Moon and his wife, Hak Ja Han, represent the \\"True Parents\\" of humankind, positioned to restore humanity's relationship with God. \\"Moonies\\" have often been portrayed as a controversial group, in part because of the church's mass weddings, called the Blessing Ceremony, where thousands of couples, some of whom had only just met, would be married simultaneously. These weddings were seen as a way to break down barriers between different races and nationalities, thus helping to create a unified world. Additionally, the Unification Church has been accused of coercive recruitment tactics, brainwashing, and financial exploitation of its members, which contributed to its controversial image. However, it is essential to mention that many members of the Unification Church do not appreciate being called \\"Moonies\\" and consider the term derogatory. They see it as a way to undermine and belittle their religious beliefs and practices. Over the years, the Unification Church has established various businesses, educational institutions, and media outlets as part of its mission to promote its teachings and create a foundation for the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. Sun Myung Moon passed away in 2012, and his wife, Hak Ja Han, now leads the church. The Unification Church continues to carry out its activities, evolve, and adapt to contemporary society while working towards its vision of global unity and peace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If a large number of Islamists from the Caucasus have Russian citizenship, will we be allowing potential terrorists into the country without visa requirements? Translate to Romanian Romanian:","output":"Dacă un număr mare de islamiști din Caucaz au cetățenie rusă, vom permite intrarea unor potențiali teroriști în țară fără cerințele de viză? Există mai multe aspecte de analizat în această problemă complexă. În primul rând, este important să recunoaștem că orice situație care implică intrarea persoanelor într-o țară implică un echilibru între securitate și libertatea de mișcare. Cu cât se aplică mai multe restricții și controale, cu atât poate crește nivelul de securitate, dar poate provoca, de asemenea, probleme sau limitări pentru cei care doresc să călătorească sau să emigreze legal. Un alt aspect important de luat în considerare este faptul că terorismul nu se limitează la o singură naționalitate, etnie sau religie. Chiar dacă există un număr mare de islamiști din Caucaz cu cetățenie rusă, nu înseamnă că toate aceste persoane sunt teroriști sau că orice terorist care dorește să intre într-o țară va fi neapărat de această origine. Este posibil ca teroriști sau simpatizanți ai unor organizații teroriste să aparțină unor naționalități diferite și să încerce să intre într-o țară prin diverse mijloace. În plus, este important să se facă diferența între persoanele care au cetățenie rusă și cele care sunt în mod specific islamiste din Caucaz. Nu toți cetățenii ruși au aceleași convingeri sau intenții, iar asumarea că toți reprezintă un risc doar pe baza naționalității lor poate fi incorectă și discriminatoare. Evaluarea riscului de terorism necesită adesea măsuri de securitate și inteligență specifice. În loc să se bazeze exclusiv pe criterii ca naționalitatea, etnia sau religia, autoritățile ar trebui să folosească informații și date obținute din diverse surse pentru a identifica persoanele care pot reprezenta efectiv un risc și apoi să decidă dacă aceste persoane trebuie sau nu să respecte cerințele de viză. În concluzie, este esențial să se evalueze cu atenție întreaga situație, luând în considerare mai mulți factori, înainte de a decide dacă permitem sau nu intrarea potențialilor teroriști în țară fără cerințele de viză. Aceasta include analizarea informațiilor despre persoanele care ar putea reprezenta un risc și a colabora cu alte țări și agenții internaționale pentru a împărtăși informații și stratagii de prevenire a terorismului. Abordarea acestei probleme prin generalizare și impunerea de restricții pe baza unor caracteristici specifice, cum ar fi cetățenia, poate fi ineficientă și poate conduce la discriminare și tensiuni inutile."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low-power transmitter, to a nationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations. Question: how is a telephone pagers made Answer:","output":"A telephone pager, also known as a beeper or simply a pager, is a wireless telecommunication device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. These devices were extensively used in the 1980s and 1990s as a precursor to modern smartphones. Though telephone pagers have largely been replaced by mobile phones, they are still in use in specialized contexts such as hospitals, emergency services, and other situations where a fast and reliable communication method is necessary. In this detailed answer, we will discuss the components of a telephone pager and how it is made. 1. Design and Planning: The process of manufacturing a telephone pager begins with design and planning. Engineers develop a blueprint for the pager based on specific requirements and functionalities. This involves determining the size, shape, materials, and components required to build the device. This stage also includes decisions about the type of pager – alphanumeric, numeric, or voice – and the desired range and power of the device. 2. Components: A typical telephone pager consists of several key components that work together to provide the desired functionality: - Antenna: A pager's antenna receives radio frequency (RF) signals from the transmitter. It can be an external or internal (built-in) component, depending on the design. - Receiver: The receiver translates the RF signals into digital or analog signals that the pager can understand. - Decoding Circuitry: When the pager receives an incoming message, the decoding circuitry processes the signal, checks for errors, and determines if the message is intended for the pager. - Memory: Pagers store incoming messages in memory, allowing users to review and manage them. - Microprocessor: The microprocessor controls the pager's functions and manages all data processes. - Display: The display provides a visual representation of the messages or notifications. It can be an LED, LCD, or E-ink display depending on the pager design. - Notifications: Many pagers offer a variety of notification options, such as vibrations, beeps, or flashing lights that alert users to incoming messages. - Battery: Pagers are usually powered by a battery, which provides necessary energy to the components. 3. Assembly: Once the design is finalized, and components are sourced, the next step in manufacturing a telephone pager is assembly. Electronics manufacturers employ various methods, such as surface-mount technology (SMT) and through-hole technology (THT), to attach components to a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB serves as the backbone that connects and supports all the pager's components. After the components are assembled on the PCB, the device is often enclosed in a protective casing made of plastic or other suitable materials. 4. Testing and Quality Control: Before pagers are released for sale or distribution, they undergo extensive testing to ensure that they function as intended. This involves testing the reception, signal decoding, and notification capabilities of the device. All components and features must be verified to meet quality standards and avoid any possible malfunctions. 5. Packaging and Distribution: Finally, after passing the quality control tests, the pagers are packaged with user manuals, accessories (such as a holster or belt clip), and batteries. They are then distributed to retail outlets, service providers, or other relevant customers. In conclusion, telephone pagers are made through a carefully planned process that involves designing, planning, sourcing and assembling components, quality control, and distribution. The manufacturing of a telephone pager depends on its intended purpose, whether for a single, low-power system like a restaurant or for broader applications like nationwide paging systems featuring thousands of high-power base stations. Today, although their usage is limited, pagers remain an important and reliable communication tool in specific industries and emergency services."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents.

As the conversation progresses, Philip continues to make remarks about her physical attractiveness and uses a suggestive comment about her looking \\"good enough to eat\\". This makes Mary feel uncomfortable, and she responds with hesitations and discomfort, not knowing how to engage in the conversation. As the dialogue continues, Philip becomes more insistent and seems to crave validation from Mary, asking her to reciprocate by complimenting him as well. Mary, however, feels that the conversation has taken a strange turn, and expresses her confusion and reluctance to engage in the dialogue further. At this point, Philip begins to make generalizations about women, accuses Mary of not being nice, and suggests that all women are the same. Mary's confusion and discomfort increase when Philip unexpectedly sends her an inappropriate picture, a dick pic, to which she responds with shock and announces that she wants to end the conversation. Philip, becoming hostile as a result, lashes out at Mary with an offensive remark. In summary, the conversation seemed to be an attempt by Philip to connect with Mary initially through compliments about her looks but quickly became inappropriate, making Mary uncomfortable. As Mary hesitated and expressed her discomfort, Philip became more insistent and ultimately hostile, leading to the end of the conversation."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Martin is unsure of Ripley, but Ripley's goddaughter, Alexandra Korolenko (Radha Mitchell), who is also Victor's daughter, convinces him otherwise, although Ripley does not like that the two are getting close. Ripley tells Martin the plan, that they are going to steal from a Russian museum that has been smuggling Russian treasures into the country and bribing the NYPD with large donations and expensive equipment. The two infiltrate a party at the museum posing as cops, with Ripley as Lt. Weber (Robert Forster), a cop who has a particular vendetta against Ripley, to gather information about their vault. The Russian mob, led by Nicky Petrovitch (Rade Å erbedÅ¾ija), grow impatient with Ripley and kidnap Alexandra, telling them they must steal two FabergÃ© eggs from the Russian Museum in order to get her back, or she dies. When the duo get into the vaults of the museum with the eggs, Martin reveals he is an undercover cop from Miami planted by Weber to catch Ripley, leaves Ripley locked in the vault and informs Weber, while taking the eggs to the Russian mobster to free Alexandra. After Alexandra is released Martin is forced to meet with Nicky who reveals that the eggs they have stolen are made of wood (like the Karelian Birch egg). Meanwhile, Weber and his squad enter the museum, but are detained by the security guards due to Martin telling the guards he was a cop as he escaped. Martin reports in to the police the next morning after the police have picked up Nicky, only to learn that the man they have in custody is not the man Martin met, and that the man he met was actually Victor Korolenko, who had faked his death with Ripley's help. It is then revealed that Ripley had escaped, letting the museum know...

Andy Murray has jumped to the defence of his fiancée Kim Sears after she appeared to launch a furious tirade at his opponent during his Australian Open semi-final victory. In one of several heated moments during the clash, the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych. As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k’. Scroll down for video Kim Sears (pictured left and right) appeared to unleash the tirade as she watched Andy Murray do battle in the Australian Open semi-final But there was no doubt that it added a fiery edge to the match, with Murray admitting afterwards that there had been acrimonious mood around","output":"the court. The incident involving Kim Sears, who has been dating Andy Murray since 2005 and got engaged to him in November 2014, took place during the highly intense and competitive semi-final match of the Australian Open against Czech player Tomas Berdych. The match was marked by several heated moments and high emotions on both sides. Kim Sears, who is usually known for her calm and poised demeanor while supporting Andy Murray during his matches, seemed to lose her cool during one of the crucial moments of the match. Caught on camera, she appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Berdych, the rival player. This incident led to a significant uproar and discussion in the media and among tennis fans, as it was quite unusual for Sears to display such strong emotions and be explicitly aggressive towards an opponent. Andy Murray, who has always been protective and supportive of his fiancée, came to her defense after the match, saying that it was just a highly emotional and intense contest with both players giving their all to win it. He explained that the incident should not be blown out of proportion and that everyone has moments when they lose their cool. Murray also acknowledged that there was an acrimonious atmosphere around the court, which could have contributed to Kim Sears' emotional outburst. Murray pointed out that it is only natural for the emotions of the people close to the players, especially their partners, to spill over during such high-stake matches. As professional athletes, their loved ones also feel the immense pressure and stress that they go through during such crucial matches. In this case, Kim Sears' tirade was most likely a manifestation of the tension she was experiencing while watching her fiancé play an important and challenging match.  In addition, Murray urged the public to be more understanding and empathetic towards the situation, instead of being critical and judgmental. It is essential to recognize that everyone has moments of weakness and emotional outbursts, especially in high-pressure situations, and the incident involving Kim Sears should be seen as an isolated one rather than an indication of her character. The incident, albeit controversial, did add a fiery edge to the match and increased the intensity of the competition between the two players. It also served as a stark reminder that tennis players and their families go through a significant amount of stress and pressure during such important tournaments. Nonetheless, it is crucial to maintain a level of sportsmanship both on and off the court, while also accepting that emotions can sometimes get the better of even the most composed individuals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: In 1795, the French revolutionary army invaded the Dutch Republic and turned the nation into a satellite of France, named the Batavian Republic. Britain, which was at war with France, soon moved to occupy Dutch colonies in Asia, South Africa and the Caribbean. Under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens signed by Britain and France in 1802, the Cape Colony and the islands of the Dutch West Indies that the British had seized were returned to the Republic. Ceylon was not returned to the Dutch and was made a British Crown Colony. After the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and France again in 1803, the British retook the Cape Colony. The British also invaded and captured the island of Java in 1811. In 1806, Napoleon dissolved the Batavian Republic and established a monarchy with his brother, Louis Bonaparte, on the throne as King of the Netherlands. Louis was removed from power by Napoleon in 1810, and the country was ruled directly from France until its liberation in 1813. The following year, the independent Netherlands signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 with Britain. All the colonies Britain had seized were returned to the Netherlands, with the exception of the Cape Colony, Guyana and Sri Lanka.

Article: Loofahs are usually the color of pale straw, with a slightly herbaceous scent. They come in many shapes and sizes, and are often sold as either cylinders or sliced discs. The texture of a loofah is rough when dry, but once you add hot water it becomes soft and supple.  Loofahs are available at most stores that sell body care accessories, including drugstores. Loofahs are different from plastic bath poufs; the two items are used for the same purpose, but loofahs are made from a plant-based material and are said to be better for the skin. Warmer water will cause the loofah to get softer more quickly. If you want the loofah to retain some texture and scrubbing ability, just wet it slightly before proceeding. Many people use body wash, which easily seeps into the surface of the loofah, but rubbing bar soap over its surface works as well. A little soap goes a long way; you only need a dime-sized amount or so. Starting at your decolletage (the expanse of skin between your neck and chest), gently but firmly rub the loofah against your skin in circular motions. Work your way down to your ankles and then repeat along the back of the body. Don't forget to scrub your arms and hands as well.  Care should be used around delicate areas such as underarms. If your skin is dry, rinse the soap out of the loofah before using it on your arms and legs. Additionally, you can use the loofah on the heels and soles of your feet. Be careful if standing in a slippery shower. The circular motion will help remove dead skin cells and is gentler on your skin than scrubbing up and down. This will close your pores and make you feel awake and refreshed. If trying to lull yourself to sleep with a shower or bath, use warm water instead.

Suddenly, Joanna is transformed: she gains the abilities to speak, reason, think just like a human, and to change color, seamlessly blending with her surroundings, making her the perfect chameleon.  As Joanna becomes aware of her newfound abilities, she also uncovers the lab scientist's sinister plans: they want to create an army of super-intelligent animals as weapons of chaos. Determined to stop them, she escapes and embarks on an adventure to gather a team to help her. Throughout her journey, from bustling cityscapes to serene forests, Joanna encounters a host of characters − some of them become her allies, some adversaries. There’s a street-smart rat named Ralph, Kat the technophile cat, and an old wise owl named Oliver. Together, they strategize to infiltrate the lab, disable the serum production, and save the animal kingdom from being exploited. Simultaneously, the bad guys realize Joanna's potential and hatch plans to recapture her. They send trained animals of their own, creating thrilling face-offs, close escapes, and high-stakes scenarios for the group.

Rogers Clark Ballard Morton (September 19, 1914 - April 19, 1979) was an American politician who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce during the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, Jr., respectively. He also served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland. Though he was born in Louisville, Kentucky, Morton moved to a farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s. In 1962, he was elected to the House of Representatives, in which capacity he established an environmental record. In 1947, Morton spent a great deal of time helping his brother Thruston in his ultimately successful campaign for election to the House of Representatives in Kentucky. After this initial exposure to politics, Morton moved to the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s, where he set up a 1,400 acres (5.7 km2) cattle farm along the Wye River in Talbot County. In 1962, Morton decided to challenge Democratic incumbent Thomas Francis Johnson of Maryland's 1st congressional district. Johnson, who was reeling from a political scandal, lost to Morton in the general election. Morton was lauded for not making Johnson's legal troubles his primary campaign issue.  Morton was re-elected to Congress four more times, and served from 1963 until 1971. In Congress, Morton worked to enact legislation that would preserve the Chesapeake Bay, including laws reducing pollution into the Bay, working for the creation of a national park on Assateague Island, and providing funds to the Army Corps of Engineers to model how the Bay functions as an estuary. Concerning civil rights, Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but not the Act of 1968.  During the 1968 Republican National Convention, Morton served as the floor manager for eventual presidential nominee Richard Nixon. Morton also delivered the speech nominating Spiro Agnew, then-Governor of Maryland, as the vice presidential candidate.  Due to his role in Nixon's election campaign and his environmental advocacy, Morton expected to be appointed as Secretary of the Interior in 1969. However, he was passed over for the position in favor of a westerner. He had also been considered for Nixon's vice presidential running mate, but lost out to Agnew. In January 1969, to recognize his efforts, Nixon appointed Morton as chairman of the Republican National Committee. As chairman, Morton was granted ex officio Cabinet rank by Nixon, an unprecedented practice that ultimately continued through the administration of Gerald Ford.

The executive power is exercised collectively by the Council of Ministers, which is led by the Prime Minister, officially referred to as President of the Council (Presidente del Consiglio). Legislative power is vested in the two houses of the Italian Parliament primarily, and secondarily on the Council of Ministers, which can introduce bills and holds the majority in both houses. The judiciary of Italy is independent of the executive and the legislative branches. It is headed by the High Council of the Judiciary, a body presided over by the President of Italy, who is the head of state though his position is separate from all branches. The current Italian President is Sergio Mattarella and the current Prime Minister of Italy is Paolo Gentiloni. What's the best answer to this question: why does italy have both a prime minister and president?","output":"The best answer to the question of why Italy has both a Prime Minister and a President is that their political system is a hybrid of a parliamentary and a semi-presidential system, allowing for a balance of powers between the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches of the government. This dual leadership structure ensures the separation of powers and contributes to maintaining the stability of the political system. 1. Distribution of powers: Having both a Prime Minister and a President allows for a more even distribution of executive responsibilities. While the Prime Minister, as head of the government, focuses on the day-to-day administration and oversees the Council of Ministers, the President, as the head of state, has a more symbolic and unifying role, representing the continuity and stability of the nation. 2. Checks and balances: The presence of both roles in the Italian political system creates a check-and-balance system, preventing any single individual from accumulating too much power. The President holds the power to dissolve the Parliament, appoint the Prime Minister, and has a say in the formation of the government, while the Prime Minister is responsible for steering government policy and holding the confidence of the Parliament. 3. Democratic representation: The President is elected by an electoral assembly, consisting of both houses of Parliament and regional representatives, while the Prime Minister is appointed by the President but must be approved by the Parliament. This ensures that both leaders represent a broad spectrum of political interests and viewpoints, further contributing to the stability of the political system. 4. Stability and continuity: The dual leadership structure lends stability to the Italian political system by ensuring the continuity of the government in case of a parliamentary crisis or the resignation of the Prime Minister. The President can step in to resolve political impasses, ensuring that the government continues to function effectively. In conclusion, Italy has both a Prime Minister and a President to strike a balance between the different branches of government, maintain stability in the political system, and ensure democratic representation. This hybrid system, combining elements of both parliamentary and presidential systems, is designed to protect from power concentration and foster cooperation among the various political forces in the country."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"The CAP's Devilish Details\\"","output":"Title: The CAP's Devilish Details Hey kids, today we are going to talk about something called CAP, which stands for Common Agricultural Policy. It sounds a little boring, but stick with me, and I'll explain it in a fun way! Once upon a time, in a big place called Europe, there were lots of people who lived in different countries. They wanted to make sure that everyone had enough food to eat, so they decided to work together and create a special plan. This plan is what we call the Common Agricultural Policy or CAP. Now, let's see what the CAP really does. Imagine if there was an enormous farm that covered all of Europe. Each country had its own little part of the farm, growing different foods like potatoes, tomatoes, and even yummy chocolate! The CAP acts like a big rulebook to make sure that all of these farms are growing their food in the best way possible. But, sometimes things can get a little complicated, and that's what we're going to talk about – the CAP's devilish details! It means that some parts of the CAP can be a bit confusing or tricky. 1. Rules, rules, and more rules One tricky part of the CAP is that there are so many rules! Farmers have to follow all of these rules to make sure they are growing their food correctly. Sometimes, these rules can be a bit too much, and it's hard for the farmers to keep track of everything. 2. Money Matters The CAP likes to help farmers by giving them money. The money helps them to grow more food and take care of the environment too. But, deciding who gets how much money can be tricky. Some people think that the big, powerful farmers get too much money and the little, hardworking farmers don't get enough. 3. Green is Good One of the CAP's main goals is to protect the environment. It wants to make sure that the farms are not hurting animals, plants, or the air and water all around them. But some people feel that the CAP isn't doing enough to help the environment. They want the farmers to be even more careful and to use different methods to grow food. 4. Where to Grow? The CAP tells farmers where they should grow their crops. Sometimes, the places that the CAP chooses aren't the best spots for the plants to grow. This can make it harder for farmers to grow enough food to feed everyone. So, there you have it, kids! The CAP is a big plan to help make sure everyone in Europe has enough food to eat and farmers take care of the environment. But, it has some devilish details – some parts that are a bit tricky or confusing. It's essential to keep working on the CAP so that it can help everyone in the best way possible. And who knows, maybe one day you can grow up to be a part of the team to make the CAP even better!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr. (March 6, 1923 - June 23, 2009) was an American announcer, game show host, comedian, actor and singer. McMahon and Johnny Carson began their long association in their first TV series, the ABC game show Who Do You Trust?, running from 1957 to 1962. Then afterwards, McMahon would make his famous thirty-year mark as Carson's sidekick, announcer and second banana on NBC's highly successfully The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson from 1962 to 1992. His long association with brewer Anheuser-Busch earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Budweiser\\" and he used that relationship to bring them aboard as one of the largest corporate donors to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Since 1973, McMahon served as co-host of the long-running live annual Labor Day weekend event of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. His 41st and final appearance on that show was in 2008, making him second only to Jerry Lewis himself in number of appearances. McMahon and Dick Clark hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes on NBC from 1982 to 1998, when Clark decided to move production of the series to ABC.  In 1967, McMahon had a role in the film The Incident and appeared as Santa Clause on The Mitzi Gaynor Christmas Show. From 1965 to 1969, McMahon served as \\"communicator\\" (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of Monitor, the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on the NBC Radio Network. The 1955 movie Dementia, which has music without dialogue, was released as Daughter of Horror in 1970. The newer version, which had a voice over by McMahon, still has music without dialogue, but with an added narration read by him. McMahon had a supporting role in the original Fun with Dick and Jane in 1977.  He then played himself in \\"Remote Control Man\\", a season one episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories. In 2004, McMahon became the announcer and co-host of Alf's Hit Talk Show on TV Land. He has authored two memoirs, Here's Johnny!: My Memories of Johnny Carson, The Tonight Show, and 46 Years of Friendship as well as For Laughing Out Loud. Over the years, he emceed the game shows Missing Links, Snap Judgment, Concentration, and Whodunnit!.  McMahon also hosted Lifestyles Live, a weekend talk program aired on the USA Radio Network. Additionally, he also appeared in the feature documentary film, Pitch People, the first motion picture to take an in-depth look at the history and evolution of pitching products to the public. In the early 2000s, McMahon made a series of Neighborhood Watch public service announcements parodying the surprise appearances to contest winners that he was supposedly known for. (In fact, it is not clear whether the company McMahon fronted, American Family Publishers, regularly performed such unannounced visits, as opposed to Publishers Clearing House and its oft-promoted \\"prize patrol\\".)  Towards the end of the decade, McMahon took on other endorsement roles, playing a rapper for a FreeCreditReport.com commercial and in a Cash4Gold commercial alongside MC Hammer. McMahon was also the spokesman for Pride Mobility, a leading power wheelchair and scooter manufacturer. His final film appearance was in the independent John Hughes themed rom-com Jelly as Mr. Closure alongside actress Natasha Lyonne.

Computers with CD/DVD drives have the necessary software and hardware to read and write CD-RW discs, making them one of the most versatile and reliable options for playing this type of disc. Additionally, several brands produce standalone CD/DVD players that specifically advertise compatibility with CD-RW discs. When purchasing a new CD or DVD player, it is essential to verify that it supports CD-RW playback to ensure compatibility. Car audio systems with CD players have also evolved over the years to include support for various disc formats, including CD-RW. However, similar to standalone CD/DVD players, it is important to check the compatibility specifications of the car audio system before attempting to play a CD-RW disc to avoid potential issues.

United agree record £37m fee for Chelsea star Mata. Juan Mata is expected to complete his move to Manchester United on Friday. The £37million man from Chelsea is set to fly from Battersea in south London straight to United's training ground. Sources close to the player have revealed that Mata has been told things are being put in place for his arrival at Carrington. Window of opportunity: Robin van Persie arrives for training and United will hope to have him back soon. Not looking clever: Tom Cleverley arrives the day after the semi-final penalties defeat by Sunderland. Arrival: Nemanja Vidic, suspended for the Sunderland debacle, drives into the training ground. A tough gig: Ryan Giggs looks lees-than impressed as he arrives at Carrington. In the shadows: Marquee summer signing Marouane Fellaini is recovering from injury. Coach in the car: Phil Neville arrives for what surely will be a chastening day at training. Flops: Shinji Kagawa (left) and Alexander Buttner both played in the semi-final loss. Flying visit: Juan Mata arrived in Manchester via helicopter as he closes in on his £37million switch to United. He has been told to be ready to leave his apartment in Chelsea at short notice and travel to a helicopter flight base in nearby Battersea. Once in Manchester, the Spanish playmaker is due to have a look round United's impressive training base, meet manager David Moyes and then head to the Bridgewater Hospital near the city centre for a medical. Back at Chelsea's training ground, Jose Mourinho was all smiles as he watched his players train ahead of the weekend FA Cup clash with Stoke. United do not have a game as they are already out of the FA Cup but it is hoped that Mata will train with his new team-mates on Friday and be ready for next Tuesday's home game against Cardiff in the Barclays Premier League. Tackle: Ramires flies in on Cesar Azpilicueta as Chelsea are put through their paces by Mourinho on Thursday. Big decision: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is happy to let Spanish playmaker Juan Mata join Manchester United. Out of sorts: Manchester United were knocked out of the League Cup after losing to Sunderland on penalties. Mata will arrive to find United at a new low after their numbing Capital One Cup shambles at home to Sunderland on Wednesday night. Moyes and his players are due at Carrington at 11am to warm down and go through the detritus of a night that ended in penalty shootout failure. United agreed the club record fee for Mata to ease the pain of their Capital One Cup exit. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho signed off on the deal following talks with club executives. United chief Ed Woodward agreed to break the club's transfer record for Mata as they attempt to salvage their season. No Juan there: Mata trained alone in Chelsea's fitness centre and away from the first team on Wednesday. On the move: Mata has spent most of this season on the bench after falling out of favour under Jose Mourinho. Japanese playmaker Shinji Kagawa's future has been thrown into doubt because of the proposed transfer. The midfielder is attracting the interest of Spanish side Atletico Madrid this January. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article, published on January 23, 2014, discusses the transfer of Juan Mata from Chelsea to Manchester United for a record fee of £37 million.

Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  What is an answer for this question: Which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water? Answer:","output":"Shallow farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water due to its sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices. To understand the reasons behind this conclusion, we need to look at the differences in agricultural methods employed by Bold farm and Shallow farm. Bold farm uses a significant amount of fertilizers, which are chemical substances containing essential nutrients that promote plant growth. While these fertilizers can lead to high crop yields, their extensive use has negative consequences on the environment and water systems. On the other hand, Shallow farm uses organic farming methods along with permaculture, which emphasizes sustainability and a harmonious relationship with nature. When rain dissolves fertilizers in the soil, the resulting runoff transports the nutrients, particularly nitrogen, into nearby bodies of water such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans. The presence of high levels of nitrogen in water bodies stimulates the rapid growth of algae, a process known as eutrophication. The algae form dense algal blooms that cover the water surface, blocking sunlight and disrupting the aquatic ecosystem. During their growth, algae consume carbon dioxide in the water. However, after they die, decomposers break down the dead algal tissue, using up oxygen in the process. As the decomposition consumes more and more oxygen, oxygen levels in the water decrease. This can create hypoxic conditions, or areas with very low oxygen concentrations, commonly known as dead zones. Dead zones are unable to support most forms of aquatic life, leading to a significant loss of biodiversity and disruption of aquatic ecosystems. Since Bold farm utilizes a large amount of fertilizers, it contributes more significantly to the process of eutrophication, and ultimately to the consumption of oxygen in water bodies. In contrast, Shallow farm, by employing organic farming practices and permaculture, reduces the use of synthetic fertilizers and focuses on maintaining a balance with the natural environment, thus having a lesser impact on oxygen consumption in water bodies. In conclusion, Shallow farm's sustainable agricultural methods contribute less to the consumption of oxygen in the water when compared to Bold farm's fertilizer-intensive approach. Encouraging the adoption of more environmentally friendly farming practices, such as organic farming and permaculture, can help mitigate the negative effects of agriculture on water ecosystems, reduce the formation of dead zones, and promote overall ecological balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. on the 68000 a stackframe is 6 bytes long, except for bus and address errors. the stackframe contains the saved sr at (a7) and the saved pc at (2,a7). Make this proper case.","output":"On the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, a stack frame is 6 bytes long, except for bus and address errors. The stack frame contains the saved Stack Pointer (SR) at the (A7) address register and the saved Program Counter (PC) at the (2, A7) address register. In order to understand the importance of the stack frame, it is necessary to discuss the concept of the stack, stack pointer, program counter, and address registers in the context of the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. The 68000 microprocessor is a 16/32-bit microprocessor that was widely used in personal computers, gaming consoles, and other applications in the 1980s and 1990s. It featured a 32-bit internal architecture and sixteen 32-bit registers, which were divided into eight data registers and eight address registers. The stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last item added to the stack will be the first item to be removed. In the context of the 68000 microprocessor, the stack is used to store return addresses, local variables, and other temporary data during the execution of a program. The Stack Pointer (SP) or Address Register 7 (A7) is a special address register that points to the top of the stack. When a new item is added to the stack, the stack pointer's value is decreased to account for the new data. When an item is removed from the stack, the stack pointer's value is increased accordingly. The Program Counter (PC) register is responsible for keeping track of the memory address of the instruction currently being executed. During the execution of a subroutine, the program counter's current value is typically saved on the stack, allowing the processor to return correctly to its previous state once the subroutine has completed. In the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, the stack frame is used to save the stack pointer and program counter when an interrupt or subroutine is executed. The 6-byte long structure consists of two parts: the saved Stack Pointer (SR) at the (A7) address register and the saved Program Counter (PC) at the (2, A7) address register. This arrangement allows the processor to restore the correct state upon returning from an interrupt or subroutine. However, for bus and address errors, the stack frame's length is different, as these types of faults require the use of an exception stack frame. The exception stack frame contains additional information to help troubleshoot and recover from the bus or address error. In conclusion, the stack frame is an essential part of the Motorola 68000 microprocessor's architecture, which ensures proper execution flow and management of temporary data during program execution. By understanding the stack frame's structure and its role in the system, programmers can write more efficient and effective code for the 68000 microprocessor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

McCready described the recording environment as \\"a pretty positive one\\" and \\"very intense and spiritual.\\" Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, \\"There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.\\" Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles \\"I Am Mine\\" and \\"Save You\\". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as \\"Love Boat Captain\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \\"Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.\\" The track entitled \\"Arc\\" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's \\"Buhleaguer\\", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had \\"impaled\\" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show.In June 2003,...  answer the following question:  What label did the band that recorded the single \\"I am Mine\\" leave in 2003?

Nationals hope to avoid arbitration with Jordan Zimmermann Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo says he hopes to avoid an arbitration hearing with Jordan Zimmermann, the only remaining arbitration-eligible National yet to agree to a deal for his 2013 salary, and could be open to multi-year-deal talks with Ian Desmond and Zimmermann. The Nationals reached deals with six of their seven arbitration-eligible players on Friday. All but Craig Stammen received one-year deals. Zimmermann was eligible for arbitration for the second time in his career this winter; he was awarded 2.3 million as a Super Two-eligible player following the 2011 season. Friday afternoon was the deadline for teams and arbitration-eligible players’ representatives to exchange salary figures for next season. SFX, the agency which represents Zimmermann, is seeking 5.8 million for next season for the 27-year-old right-hander, but the Nationals have countered with 4.6 million. The two sides are talking, Rizzo said Saturday, with the Nationals hoping to avoid an arbitration hearing, a contentious process that most teams generally prefer to avoid by striking deals. “We’ve proved in the past that we will (go to a hearing) if we have to,” said Rizzo, speaking after Saturdays’ New York Baseball Writers’ Association Dinner where Bryce Harper and Davey Johnson received their end-of-season awards. “We certainly don’t want to. He’s a long-term part of our organization and you hate to go to arbitration with him. But sometimes you have to if the numbers aren’t matched up and you can’t, and they see it one way and we see it the other, you have a third party break the tie.” Zimmermann and Ian Desmond, both important reasons for the Nationals’ success last season and vital pieces of their future, both seem like ideal candidates for multi-year extensions. Both are under team control until 2016. And if both continue to performan well, their salaries will continue to rise in arbitration. Desmond, who had a breakout 2012 season, will early nearly 3.7 million more next season after being eligible for arbitration for the first time in his career this winter. As Friday’s deadline loomed, Rizzo said it’s often easier to first get the one-year deals done for the following season and then consider long-term deals. Rizzo said he spoke with Desmond, 27, during last season about the idea of a contract extension. But Desmond asked to table it until the offseason, wanting to concentrate on the season. Rizzo said he broached the subject of an extension with Zimmermann before the 2012 season but hasn’t revisited the idea with him since. Rizzo said he is open to extensions for both but didn’t say it would definitely happen. “Any long-term deal that makes sense for us to keep component players, we’re definitely open minded about,” he said. Stammen was the only arbitration-eligible Nationals player to agree to a deal beyond one-year, signing a two-year 2.25 million contract that will buy out his first two years of arbitration. The Nationals control Stammen’s rights through 2016, and Rizzo said it was ideal to lock up the versatile, right-handed reliever, who is just 28. “Often times, at that point of a reliever’s career, when they’re first-time eligibles, and you’re talking that kind of money, it’s nice to give them some,” Rizzo said. “It’s the first time in his career he’s really had some security. And we thought he earned it and the numbers made sense for us. It gave us a little cost-certainty. It gave him a little security.” What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the Washington Nationals' efforts to avoid arbitration with their starting pitcher, Jordan Zimmermann, for his 2013 salary. It also covers the possibility of negotiating multi-year deals with both Zimmermann and the team's shortstop, Ian Desmond.

In this particular case, Zimmermann and his agency, SFX, were seeking a salary of 5.8 million for the season while the Nationals offered 4.6 million. The negotiations continued with the hope of avoiding a hearing to settle the dispute. Additionally, the team expressed interest in discussing long-term deals with both Zimmermann and Desmond, who were significant contributors to the Nationals' successful performance in the 2012 season and were considered integral pieces of the team's future.

Paragraph: French and British Ties and Occupation: The daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella married the son and heir of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian of Hapsburg. The Spanish crown duly passed to the Hapsburgs, and Spain remained in their hands until the feeble-minded Carlos II died in 1700, leaving no heir. France seized the chance to install the young grandson of Louis XIV on the Spanish throne. A rival Hapsburg claimant was supported by Austria and Britain, who saw a powerful Spanish-French alliance as a major threat. In the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession (1702 –1713) most of the old kingdom of Aragón, including the Balearics, backed the Hapsburgs. Britain seized Gibraltar — in the name of the Hapsburg claimant — and retained it when the war was over. In 1708 Britain captured Menorca, and the magnificent harbor of Mahón (Maó), for the Royal Navy. England clung to it even when Bourbon forces captured Mallorca at the end of the war. Menorca changed hands between Britain, France, and Spain five more times in less than a century. Britain finally ceded the island to Spain in the year 1802, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens. By 1805, Spain was once more aligned with France, and Spanish ships fought alongside the French against Nelson at Trafalgar. Napoleon came to distrust his Spanish ally and forcibly replaced the king of Spain with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte. A French army marched in to subdue the country. The Spanish resisted and, aided by British troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, drove the French out. What British historians call the Peninsular War (1808–1814) is known in Spain as the War of Independence. In the 19th century, practically all of Spain’s possessions in the Americas broke away in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, and the few that remained were lost at the end of the 19th century. The Balearics, further neglected, were beset with poverty and outbreaks of disease. However, toward the 20th century, things began to improve on the islands, with Mallorca reaping the rewards of successful agricultural crops and Menorca launching an export shoe industry.  Question: \\"What is the name of the island that Britain ceded to Spain in 1802?\\" Answer: \\"Gibraltar\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is incorrect.

Entomology (from Greek , \\"entomon\\" \\"insect\\"; and , \\"\\") is the scientific study of insects, a branch of zoology. In the past the term \\"insect\\" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla, such as arachnids, myriapods, earthworms, land snails, and slugs. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use.  Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology, entomology is a taxon-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics, behavior, biomechanics, biochemistry, systematics, physiology, developmental biology, ecology, morphology, and paleontology.  At some 1.3 million described species, insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms, date back some 400 million years, and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth.  Entomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping), but scientific study began only as recently as the 16th century.  William Kirby is widely considered as the father of Entomology. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, \\"Introduction to Entomology\\", regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s.

Dean graduated from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1971. As a freshman, he requested specifically to room with an African-American. The university housing office complied and Dean roomed with two Southern black students and one white student from Pennsylvania. One of Dean's roommates was Ralph Dawson, the son of a sheet metal worker in Charleston, South Carolina and today a New York City labor lawyer. Dawson said of Dean:  Unless you operated from a stereotypic understanding of the Yale white boy as rich, you wouldn't know that about Howard.... When it came to race- and I don't know whether this was a function of intent or just came naturally- Howard was not patronizing in any way. He was willing to confront in discussion what a lot of white students weren't. He would hold his ground. He would respect that I knew forty-two million times more about being black than he did. But that didn't mean he couldn't hold a view on something relating to civil rights that would be as valid as mine. There were lots of well-meaning people at Yale who wanted you to understand that they understood your plight; you'd get into a conversation and they would yield too soon, so we didn't get the full benefit of the exchange. Howard very much thought he was capable of working an issue through. He was inquisitive. And when he came to a conclusion he would be as strong as anybody else. I don't think he's stubborn. He's a guy who's always been comfortable in his own skin. That's something you still see in him today, and it gets him into some degree of controversy.  Though eventually eligible to be drafted into the military, he received a deferment for an unfused vertebra. He explained to Tim Russert on Meet the Press, \\"I was really in no hurry to join the military.\\" He briefly tried a career as a stockbroker before deciding on a career in medicine, completing pre-medicine classes at Columbia University. In 1974, Dean's younger brother Charlie, who had been traveling through southeast Asia at the time, was captured and killed by Laotian guerrillas, a tragedy widely reported to have an enormous influence in Dean's life; he wore his brother's belt every day of his presidential campaign.","output":"This text is about Howard Brush Dean III.

They are usually a white dwarf with a companion late sequence red giant. They are indicated by the exhibition of spectral lines of the highly contrasting temperatures of the red giant (~3000 K) and the white dwarf (~20 000 K). The white dwarf gains mass from stellar wind from the red giant or gravitational streaming.  - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then:  - A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name \\"white dwarf\\" was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922. The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take many billions of years.  - Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. This is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models. Brightness refers to an absolute term and should not be confused with Lightness.  - A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass (roughly 0.38 solar masses) in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature as low as 5,000 K and lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars.  - A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called \\"multiple star systems\\". These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means. Research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star. It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric.  - AG Draconis is a binary system consisting of an orange - red giant star and a white dwarf star that revolve around each other every 550 days . It has a baseline apparent magnitude of around 9.8 and flares up to around magnitude 7.3 and is one of the most - studied of symbiotic star systems and its variations in brightness have been observed for 124 years . The outbursts occur every 15 years and last for 3 -- 6 years . The larger star is thought to be an orange giant around 1.5 times as massive as the Sun that has swollen to around 35 times the diameter of the Sun with a spectral type measured at K3IIIep . The smaller star is a compact hot white dwarf around 0.4 times as massive as the Sun , with a surface temperature of around 80,000 K. The star is located in a spherical halo around the Milky Way , and is a nova variable , erupting every 10 -- 15 years .  - The apparent magnitude of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of 27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512.    What entity does 'ag draconis' has the relation 'instance of' with? A:","output":"AG Draconis has the relation \\"instance of\\" with the entity \\"symbiotic star system.\\" This is because AG Draconis is a binary system consisting of an orange-red giant star and a white dwarf star that orbit around each other, exhibiting the characteristics of a symbiotic star system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A premise is something you believe is true or a fact. A hypothesis is like a guess you make based on the premise. In this case, the premise is saying you didn't like someone messing with your old shell. The hypothesis is saying you watched a dissection from another room and didn't feel happy about it. Now, the question is, if the premise is true, is the hypothesis true too? We can't say for sure because these two things are not connected directly. Just because you didn't like someone touching your shell doesn't automatically mean you were unhappy watching a dissection from another room. So, it's not possible to say if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true too."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - DB Schenker is a division of Deutsche Bahn AG that focuses on logistics.

They are most closely related to the terns (family Sternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to the waders. Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus \\"Larus\\", but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mew, cognate with German \\"Möwe\\", Danish \\"måge\\", Dutch \\"meeuw\\", and French \\"mouette\\"; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects.  - The black tern ( Chlidonias niger or Chlidonias nigra ) is a small tern generally found in or near inland water in Europe and North America . As its name suggests , it has predominantly dark plumage . In some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season , hence the old English name \`\` blue darr '' . The scientific name means \`\` like a swallow '' .  - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow.  - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Terns are seabirds in the family Sternidae that have a worldwide distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Previously considered a subfamily of the gulls, Laridae, they are now usually given full family status and divided into eleven genera. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for at least part of the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap.  - The name marsh tern refers to terns of the genus \\"Chlidonias\\", which are typically found in freshwater marshes, rather than coastal locations. The genus name \\"Chlidonias\\" is from Ancient Greek \\"khelidonios\\", \\"swallow-like\\", from \\"khelidon\\", \\"swallow\\".  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe.

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Inca tern (\\"Larosterna inca\\") is a seabird in the family Sternidae. It is the only member of the genus \\"Larosterna\\".  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\".  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability.

As more thunderstorms merge and interact, they can produce stronger updrafts and downdrafts, further enhancing the organization of the hurricane. Effect: More Step 4: The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating. More thunderstorms mean that more warm, moist air will be available to fuel the hurricane. This could result in a more powerful hurricane as it feeds off the available energy. Effect: More Step 5: When the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is considered a hurricane.

Fact 2: Oxygenated blood is red, deoxygenated blood is blue.  Given the two facts above, veins generally carry what type of blood? A:","output":"Veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. Let's break this down and delve deeper into this. Fact 1, as stated, is that veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. This is generally correct with some exceptions. To understand this, let's have a look at the circulatory system. In the human body, our circulatory system is essentially a vast network of blood vessels including arteries, veins, and capillaries. The circulatory system transports blood around the body, supplying cells with the nutrients and oxygen they require while also removing waste products. This system is powered by the heart, which acts as a pump.  The blood's journey usually starts at the heart, rich in oxygen, and it gets pumped into arteries. Arteries carry this oxygen-rich blood to various parts of the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients. On the other hand, veins are the blood vessels responsible for carrying blood toward the heart. This blood carried by veins, having delivered its oxygen, is now generally deoxygenated, which is why we say that veins generally carry deoxygenated blood.  However, an important exception to this is the pulmonary veins. Pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the heart, ready to be pumped back into the arteries. Fact 2 states that oxygenated blood is red, and deoxygenated blood is blue. However, this statement is partially incorrect. In reality, deoxygenated blood is not blue; it's a deeper, darker red. This common misconception likely stems from the way veins appear blue or green underneath the skin. This is because only blue light can penetrate the skin deep enough to illuminate the veins. To conclude, given the facts and taking into account the corrections required to Fact 2, veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. The blood is not blue but instead is a darker shade of red due to the lack of oxygen. The exception to this statement is the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the heart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: \\"In most cases, how does small doses of alcohol effect a person on antibiotics?\\"  Context: \\"Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. While moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side-effects. Therefore, potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered. Despite the lack of a categorical counterindication, the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In most cases, consuming small doses of alcohol while taking antibiotics may not lead to severe side effects or significantly impact the effectiveness of the antibiotic therapy; however, the precise outcome depends on the type of antibiotic being administered and the individual’s specific health condition. There are several reasons why mixing alcohol and antibiotics can be potentially problematic. The primary concerns include the potential to reduce the effectiveness of the antibiotic, increased side effects, and the burden on the liver. Firstly, it is important to understand that the liver plays a crucial role in processing and eliminating both alcohol and antibiotics from the body. Consuming alcohol while on antibiotics may put additional strain on the liver, which in turn may delay the healing process. Some types of antibiotics have been known to cause adverse reactions when mixed with alcohol. For instance, disulfiram-like reactions can occur when alcohol is consumed with certain antibiotics, such as metronidazole, tinidazole, and some cephalosporins. These reactions can cause symptoms such as flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting, rapid heart rate, and shortness of breath. While these side effects can be uncomfortable, they are typically not life-threatening. Another concern is that alcohol can have an impact on the immune system. Consuming alcohol, even in small quantities, may temporarily weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. Therefore, while the antibiotic itself may not be directly affected, the body's ability to utilize the medication to combat the infection might be somewhat diminished. Additionally, alcohol may interfere with an individual's ability to adhere to their medication regimen. For example, drinking alcohol may lead to forgetfulness or skipping doses, which can decrease the effectiveness of the treatment. It is also important to note that each person's response to alcohol and antibiotics can vary greatly. Factors such as age, body weight, pre-existing health conditions, and the specific antibiotic prescribed can all influence how a person reacts to the combination of alcohol and antibiotics. While moderate alcohol consumption might not necessarily lead to severe interactions for many common antibiotics, it is still essential to consider the potential risks. Certain antibiotics, as mentioned earlier, can lead to serious side effects when mixed with alcohol. Therefore, individuals should consult with their healthcare provider to better understand the possible consequences of consuming alcohol while on antibiotics. In conclusion, while small doses of alcohol may not cause severe side effects or reduce the effectiveness of most antibiotics, it is important to recognize the potential risks associated with combining the two substances.

He was not afraid of any wild animals, not even a tiger. One night, someone saw a tiger come into the village, and stole two sheep away. The next night the tiger came again. The villagers were frightened. They asked the old hunter to catch it so that they could have a safe life. When the old man heard about the tiger, he thought hard. He wondered why the tiger came at night twice but only stole the sheep. The next night he walked outside the village. Suddenly he saw the tiger coming. He quickly threw himself on the ground. To his surprise, the tiger did not come at him, but went away. He followed it quietly and found it was running on two of its feet just like a man. Then everything was clear.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which area experiences more soil erosion?  The Gorge saw some negative effects due to deforestation. The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon.  Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. A:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, the area that experiences more soil erosion is the Tibetan Plateau. The paragraph describes a decline in biodiversity, poor soil quality, and increased soil erosion in this region due to a lack of vital nutrients like water, nitrogen, and carbon. Additionally, the text highlights that grassland degradation contributes to significant annual economic losses in the northern Chinese province, further emphasizing the severity of soil erosion in the Tibetan Plateau. In contrast, the Valley has more fertile soil, is not overgrazed, has abundant trees and bushes, and its productivity has increased. The biodiversity and healthy, nutrient-rich soils in the Valley help it retain water, nitrogen, and carbon, making it less susceptible to soil erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(CNN) -- In dueling speeches that sought to frame the economic debate for their election showdown in November, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on Thursday offered differing visions for how to restore strong growth while telling separate Ohio crowds that the other's policies have failed. The president and the former Massachusetts governor both emphasized particular themes of community in their campaign speeches in a battleground state hit hard by the 2008 recession and its aftermath. Romney, speaking at a factory in the Cincinnati area minutes before Obama's speech in Cleveland, focused on what he called the president's failure to deliver promised economic growth so far in his first term. White voters were split on","output":"which candidate's economic vision would be the best solution to the nation's financial woes. Throughout the rest of the passage, it becomes evident that both Obama and Romney presented compelling perspectives, leaving the ultimate decision to the voting populace. Obama's approach to restoring economic growth concentrated on increasing government investment in essential infrastructure, education, and clean energy. He emphasized the importance of nurturing a strong middle class and ensuring that prosperity is attainable for future generations. Obama argued that his predecessor's administration was responsible for the fiscal crisis, referencing failed policies that handed out tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of average American families. Furthermore, he noted that Romney's proposals echoed those of previous administrations, which ultimately led to the economic collapse. On the other hand, Romney's economic plan revolved around reducing federal spending and taxes, easing government regulations, and encouraging entrepreneurship. He contended that Obama's administration stifled economic recovery by excessively regulating businesses and increasing the federal deficit. Romney argued that the free market should be allowed to function without excessive government involvement, stating that the private sector was best suited to create jobs and stimulate overall growth. He maintained that the implementation of these strategies would ultimately strengthen the economy and boost job creation, leading to a more prosperous future for all Americans. Both candidates sought to address prevalent issues such as high unemployment rates, declining wages, increasing federal debt, and financial instability. However, their strategies to address these challenges were significantly different: while Obama leaned on the government’s involvement and investment, Romney advocated for deregulation and minimal intervention.  Though white voters were divided in their opinions about the most effective approach to stimulate the economy, they had to carefully analyze the candidates’ proposals and assess which economic strategy aligned with their beliefs and values. The outcome of November's election would rely heavily on voters' faith in either Obama's dedication to build a more equal and sustainable society or Romney's faith in the free market and limited government intervention. The 2012 presidential race further reinforced the necessity of open dialogue and informed decision-making, as citizens recognized the profound impact their preferred candidate's policies would have on the nation's economic recovery and future growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Particularly if you’re a slow reader, you may find it more effective to read the beginning and end of the chapter, along with pull-outs (information placed in a box, graph, or other attention-grabbing area on the page) and anything bolded or italicized in the text. Another common mistake students make is to read their textbook once and then never look at it again. A better strategy is to practice layered reading.  On your first read-through, skim the material. Determine what the main idea or goal of the text is (often signaled by the chapter title and subheadings), and mark any places that you didn’t feel as though you understood well. Read headings, subheadings, and other organizational elements. Textbook authors often construct their chapters so that it is very clear what the goal of each section is. Use this to your advantage. Read for more detail in later readings. Sometimes, students will just move their eyes along the page again and again and feel like they’re not getting anything from their “reading.” Reading is an active process: you need to be engaged, paying attention, and thinking about what you read. While it’s tempting to break out the rainbow of highlighters when you read through a chapter, avoid this temptation. Research has shown that highlighting actually can hamper your reading because you may feel tempted to highlight every single thing you feel is important without thinking critically about the ideas presented. If you must highlight, wait until you’ve completed your first read-through, and use the highlighter sparingly to point out only the most important ideas. It can be tempting to just read past words or elements you don’t understand in an effort to “just get it done.” This actually damages comprehension. If a dense textbook on Marxist economics has terms that you don’t initially understand, don’t just read on: stop what you’re doing, look up the word, and understand it before continuing.

There are rooms where you can have a quiet nap, too, just like in preschool, but for big people, and even a special garden indoors! It's like having a park, but inside where it won't get rained on!

And there's one more special city, called Helsinki-Vantaa. It's a bit hard to pronounce, right? Anyways, this city won a gold star too because there, they hardly ever lose bags. Just like when your teacher makes sure no one loses their lunchbox at school. So, my little friend, that's a lot of big words, but it's just about a really big, really cool playground in the city of Incheon, and how it's just a teeny bit better than some other big, cool playgrounds in cities all around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - headache - get up - happiness - discomfort - shock  I believe the correct choice is \\"shock\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"Awaking from a nightmare can be a jarring and unsettling experience that can leave one feeling a wide range of emotions and sensations. Among the possible options provided, \\"shock\\" seems to be the most appropriate choice due to the sudden and intense nature of nightmares. However, it is important to address each potential answer and explain their connection or lack thereof to the experience of waking up from a nightmare. 1. Headache: While it is possible for some individuals to experience a headache after waking up from a nightmare, this is not a universal reaction. A headache might occur due to the increased stress and anxiety experienced during the nightmare, leading to muscle tension in the neck or head. Additionally, the abrupt change in the sleep cycle, such as waking up suddenly, could also result in a headache. However, this response varies from one person to another and should not be considered a definitive answer. 2. Get up: Waking up from a nightmare might trigger a strong urge to get up, either to shake off the distressing dream or to make sure that one is safe in their surroundings. This reaction might be influenced by the severity of the nightmare and the individual's coping mechanism. However, not everyone jumps out of bed after a nightmare, with some opting to stay put and calm themselves down. Therefore, although \\"get up\\" is a plausible reaction, it is not a definitive answer. 3. Happiness: The feeling of happiness after waking up from a nightmare might result from the relief that the dream was not real and the realization that one is safe. However, the initial emotions experienced upon waking up are likely to be more negative, such as fear, anxiety, or sadness. Consequently, happiness might not be an immediate response or the primary emotion experienced, making it a less appropriate option. 4. Discomfort: Waking up from a nightmare might leave a lingering sense of discomfort, especially if the dream was particularly disturbing or unsettling. This emotional and psychological distress could manifest as physical discomfort, resulting from increased stress levels and muscle tension. However, the term 'discomfort' might not fully capture the intensity of the emotions experienced after a nightmare and lacks the suddenness associated with the term 'shock.' 5. Shock: The correct choice identified is \\"shock,\\" as it best encapsulates the abrupt and powerful emotions experienced upon awakening from a nightmare. The vivid, distressing events that transpire during a nightmare can leave an individual feeling disoriented and unsettled. As the brain transitions from the dream state to awake consciousness, one may struggle to make sense of the intense emotions stirred up by the nightmare. This sudden disorientation and realization that they are safe can lead to a sense of shock. In conclusion, while various emotions and reactions might surface after waking up from a nightmare, \\"shock\\" appears to be the most appropriate choice. The intensity and abruptness associated with shock better convey the experience of transitioning from a distressing dream to the awake state. However, it is vital to acknowledge that individual responses might vary, and the other options might still be relevant to specific scenarios."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - The salt water is heated - As the saltwater is heated the water becomes a gas - The salt particles sink to the bottom of the container - Gaseous water is piped into another container - Allowed to cool - The salt particles are left behind in the first container - The second container contains fresh water.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the open container takes longer to heat happens, how will it affect less water becomes a gas.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Analyzing the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the open container takes longer to heat, less water will become a gas. Step 2: Reflecting on the initial process In the initial process, the saltwater is heated, turning the water into a gas. If less water becomes a gas, it would essentially mean that the quantity of gaseous water produced would be reduced. Step 3: Assessing the implications of the hypothesis on the process If the perturbation hypothesis holds true, it suggests that the open container taking longer to heat would result in less gaseous water being produced. This would likely have the following effects: 1. Reduced volume of gaseous water being piped into the second container: If less water becomes a gas, the volume of gaseous water piped into the second container would also be reduced. This, in turn, could affect the efficiency of the process, resulting in a lower yield of fresh water in the second container. 2. Slower rate of salt particles settling at the bottom of the first container: As less water vapor is formed, it may take longer for the salt particles to settle at the bottom of the first container. 3. Possible inefficiency in salt separation: If there is a reduced amount of gaseous water produced, there is a possibility that some salt particles might be carried over with the gaseous water, causing a less efficient separation of salt from the fresh water. Step 4: Evaluating the overall impact In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the open container takes longer to heat, it may have a direct effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of the water desalination process. It could result in a lower yield of fresh water, a slower rate of salt particles settling, and potentially less efficient salt separation. It may be necessary to adjust the process parameters to compensate for these effects, such as increasing the heating time or temperature to ensure adequate gaseous water production and subsequent salt separation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What drove the sea beast from its natural habitat? Movie plot title: It Came from Beneath the Sea Movie plot: A nuclear submarine on maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean, captained by Commander Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey), comes into contact with a massive sonar return. The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify. Lesley is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story for government officials, who then have the evidence they need. The U.S. government halts all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason. John flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Pete and Lesley follow up on a report of three missing people on the coast of Oregon. The local sheriff, Bill Nash (Harry Lauter), takes Pete and Leslie to the site of the attack, where they find a giant suction cup imprint in the beach sand; they then request that John join them. Bill is later attacked along the beach by the giant... A:","output":"The sea beast, a gigantic octopus, was driven from its natural habitat in the Mindanao Deep due to hydrogen bomb testing in the area. The testing made the giant creature radioactive, which drove off its natural food supply.

Answer with text (not indexes). Context: Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning., The Corps of Royal Engineers, usually just called the Royal Engineers (RE), and commonly known as the \\"Sappers\\", is one of the corps of the British Army. It is highly regarded throughout the military, and especially the Army., The Battle of Rorke's Drift, also known as the Defence of Rorke's Drift, was a battle in the Anglo-Zulu War. The defence of the mission station of Rorke's Drift, under the command of Lieutenant John Chard of the Royal Engineers and Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, immediately followed the British Army's defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879, and continued into the following day, 23 January., Major Gonville Bromhead VC (29 August 1845  9 February 1891) was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of the British armed forces. He received the medal for his part in the defence of Rorke's Drift in January 1879 where a small British garrison of 139 soldiers successfully repulsed an assault by some 4,000 Zulu warriors. Bromhead was portrayed by Michael Caine in the film \\"Zulu\\", which depicted the battle., Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819  22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India., The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace., William Wilson Allen , VC ( circa 1843 -- 12 March 1890 ) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross ( VC ) for his actions at the Battle of Rorke 's Drift in January 1879 , the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces ., The Battle of Isandlwana (alternative spelling: Isandhlwana) on 22 January 1879 was the first major encounter in the AngloZulu War between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Eleven days after the British commenced their invasion of Zululand in South Africa, a Zulu force of some 20,000 warriors attacked a portion of the British main column consisting of about 1,800 British, colonial and native troops and perhaps 400 civilians. The Zulus were equipped mainly with the traditional assegai iron spears and cow-hide shields, but also had a number of muskets and old rifles though they were not formally trained in their use. The British and colonial troops were armed with the state-of-the-art Martini-Henry breech-loading rifle and two 7-pounder (3-inch, 76 mm) mountain guns deployed as field guns, as well as a rocket battery. Despite a vast disadvantage in weapons technology, the numerically superior Zulus ultimately overwhelmed the poorly led and badly deployed British, killing over 1,300 troops, including all those out on the forward firing line. The Zulu army suffered around a thousand killed., The Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army., The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff., Subject: william allen , Relation: country_of_citizenship, Options: (A) british (B) british empire (C) great britain (D) india (E) kingdom of great britain (F) london (G) united kingdom (H) united kingdom of great britain and ireland A:","output":"The task is to find the country of citizenship for William Allen based on the given context that discusses the relation between Buckingham Palace, the Royal Engineers, the Battle of Rorke's Drift, Major Gonville Bromhead, Queen Victoria, the Victoria Cross, William Allen, and the Anglo-Zulu War. Steps to solve the task: 1. Identify the subject: William Allen. 2. Identify the relation: country_of_citizenship. 3. Review the context and options to find the correct answer. From the context: \\"William Wilson Allen , VC ( circa 1843 -- 12 March 1890 ) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross ( VC ) for his actions at the Battle of Rorke 's Drift in January 1879 , the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\\" Now, we will examine the options: (A) British: This could be citizenship, but it's not the name of a country. (B) British Empire: Refers to the larger entity encompassing several nations, not a country itself. (C) Great Britain: Refers to the geographic region, not the specific name of a country. (D) India: Not relevant to his citizenship. (E) Kingdom of Great Britain: The historical name of the country, but not applicable for the time he lived. (F) London: A city, not a country. (G) United Kingdom: A potential answer since it is the name of a country. (H) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland: Another possible answer, as it is the historical name of the country during the time he lived. Comparing the two potential answers (G) and (H), we can conclude that the most accurate answer is: Answer: (H) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers).

He had developed a GMO crop that he labeled as crop A. To see how his GMO crop compare with another crop he selected crop B. Crop B was a non-GMO crop. Keith needed to find the pros and cons of both crops.  Would crop A more likely or less likely be virus resistant than crop B?  Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... A:","output":"To determine if crop A, the GMO crop, is more likely or less likely to be virus resistant than crop B, the non-GMO crop, let's examine the steps involved in developing and comparing the two crops: Step 1: Identify the genetic modification in crop A Keith has developed crop A using genetic engineering techniques, which means he has introduced new genes or modified existing ones to achieve desired traits. We know from the hint that one of these possible traits is virus resistance. Step 2: Evaluate the specific traits of crop B Crop B is a non-GMO crop, which means that its traits have not been altered through genetic engineering. Its virus resistance capabilities, if any, would be a result of natural processes and traditional breeding methods. Step 3: Compare virus resistance in both crops To determine which crop is more likely to be virus resistant, we need to compare the virus resistance potential of the introduced or modified genes in crop A to the virus resistance capabilities of crop B. This can be done by conducting controlled experiments and analyzing the crop's response to various virus strains. Step 4: Consider external factors In addition to the crops' inherent traits, the level of virus resistance could be influenced by the environment, cultivation practices, and exposure to other external factors. These factors should be taken into account when estimating the overall virus resistance of both crops. Justification: As GMO crops, such as crop A, can be designed and bred specifically to have enhanced virus resistance, it is more likely that crop A would be more virus resistant than crop B. Genetic engineering techniques provide a broader set of genes to work with, allowing for targeted improvements in traits such as virus resistance. On the other hand, crop B relies on traditional breeding methods and natural processes for its traits, which might not provide the same level of resistance as the GMO crop. Therefore, based on the information provided and the potential enhancement through genetic engineering, crop A is more likely to be virus resistant than crop B. However, a comprehensive study of the specific crops and their performance under various conditions would provide a more accurate and detailed comparison."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This indicates an increased rate of digestion. 2. Faster digestion might mean that the enzymes and acids in the stomach and small intestine have less time to break down the food completely. 3. When food isn't broken down into its smallest molecules effectively, it becomes more difficult for the nutrients to pass through the wall of the small intestine and be absorbed into the bloodstream. 4.

Espionage can be committed by an individual or a spy ring (a cooperating group of spies), in the service of a government or a company, or operating independently. The practice is inherently clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome and in many cases illegal and punishable by law. Espionage is a subset of \\"intelligence\\" gathering, which includes espionage as well as information gathering from public sources.  - The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland. The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) East division. One of the AL's eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901 with President Ban Johnson, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns. After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by Baltimore business interests led by Clarence Miles. The franchise officially moved to Baltimore for the 1954 season and adopted the historic \\"Orioles\\" name in honor of the official state bird of Maryland.

Seventeen of his novels were bestsellers, and more than 100 million copies of his books are in print. His name was also used on movie scripts written by ghost writers, nonfiction books on military subjects, and video games. He was a part-owner of the Baltimore Orioles and vice-chairman of their community activities and public affairs committees.  - A bestseller is a book that is included on a list of top-selling or frequently-borrowed titles, normally based on publishing industry and book trade figures and library circulation statistics; such lists may be published by newspapers, magazines, or book store chains. Some lists are broken down into classifications and specialties (number one best selling new novel, nonfiction book, cookbook, etc.).

Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"healing requires what as well as sitting\\" and the following answer choices:  - sleep  - fasting  - running  - muscles  - heat  - energy  - jumping  - oxygen  Now knowing that healing requires rest and rest can include sleep as well as sitting and resting, choose the best answer. A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"healing requires what as well as sitting\\" would be sleep. This is because healing, in a broad sense, requires rest and giving the body a chance to recover. Rest is not limited to sitting, but also includes other forms of physical and mental repose. Among the given answer choices, sleep is the most appropriate response for the following reasons: 1. Sleep is a crucial aspect of rest: Sleep is an essential component of physical and mental rest where the body has a chance to repair and regenerate itself. During sleep, our body enters a restorative phase where various physiological processes occur, such as tissue repair, the release of growth hormones, and the consolidation of memories. These processes allow the body to heal effectively and efficiently. 2. Sleep supports the immune system: An adequate amount of sleep is necessary for maintaining a healthy immune system. The immune system plays a vital role in the healing process by protecting the body against infections and facilitating the repair of damaged tissues. Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can negatively impact the immune system, making it harder for the body to heal. 3. The healing process is optimized during sleep: The body's healing mechanism operates more efficiently during sleep. As we sleep, our body undergoes various processes that support the healing of tissues, muscles, and organs. For example, during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage, our body experiences an increase in blood flow to the muscles, allowing for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients that promote healing and growth. 4. Sleep reduces stress and inflammation: Stress and inflammation can hinder the body's healing process. Sleep helps regulate stress hormones, such as cortisol, and reduces inflammation by increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. By lowering stress and inflammation, sleep facilitates a conducive environment for the body to heal and recover. In conclusion, the best answer to the question \\"healing requires what as well as sitting\\" is sleep, as it encompasses various aspects of rest that promote the healing process. Sleep plays a vital role in supporting the immune system, optimizing the body's healing mechanisms, and reducing stress and inflammation, all of which contribute to faster and more effective healing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Settlement\\" correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Settlement\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\". Instead, the answer should be \\"No, it was not a positive development\\" because the paragraph states that the Arawak population was subjugated by the Spanish, many died due to oppression and diseases brought by the Europeans, and some even committed suicide to avoid living under the conditions imposed by the Spanish. Additionally, the arrival of the Europeans led to the decline of the Arawak population and the introduction of African slaves to work the land."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - Viseu is a city and municipality in the Centro Region of Portugal and the capital of the district of the same name, with a population of 99,274 inhabitants, and center of the Viseu Dão Lafões intermunipical community, with 267,633 inhabitants.  - Politika is a Serbian daily newspaper, published in Belgrade. Founded in 1904 by Vladislav F. Ribnikar, it is the oldest daily newspaper still in circulation in the Balkans and is considered to be Serbia's newspaper of record.  - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ;  in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.  - Manuel Maria Ferreira Carrilho ( Portuguese pronunciation : ( mnu mi kiu ) ; b. Viseu , 9 July 1951 ) is a Portuguese philosopher , academic and politician .  - A private military company (PMC) is a private company providing armed combat and/or security services. PMCs refer to their staff as \\"security contractors\\" or \\"private military contractors\\". Private military companies refer to their business generally as the \\"private military industry\\" or \\"The Circuit\\". The United Nations, in a convention so far ratified by 35 states, considers PMCs to be mercenaries and prohibits them; the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and the United States are not signatories to the convention, and the United States has rejected the UN's classification of PMCs as mercenaries.  - Academi is an American private military company founded in 1997 by former Navy SEAL officer Erik Prince as Blackwater., renamed as XE Services in 2009 and now known as Academi since 2011 after the company was acquired by a group of private investors. The company received widespread notoriety in 2007, when a group of its employees killed 17 Iraqi civilians and injured 20 in Nisour Square, Baghdad for which four guards were convicted in a U.S. court.  - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

He has sometimes been incorrectly referred to as James Danforth Quayle III. In his memoirs, he points out that his birth name was simply James Danforth Quayle. The name Quayle originates from the Isle of Man, where his great-grandfather was born. Quayle became an investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Indiana Attorney General in July 1971. Later that year, he became an administrative assistant to Governor Edgar Whitcomb. From 1973 to 1974, he was the Director of the Inheritance Tax Division of the Indiana Department of Revenue. Upon receiving his law degree, Quayle worked as associate publisher of his family's newspaper, the Huntington Herald-Press.  In 1976, Quayle was elected to the House of Representatives from Indiana's 4th congressional district, defeating eight-term incumbent Democrat J. Edward Roush by a 55%-to-45% margin. He won reelection in 1978 by the greatest percentage margin achieved to date in that northeast Indiana district. In 1980, at age 33, Quayle became the youngest person ever elected to the Senate from the state of Indiana, defeating three-term incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh by taking 54% of the votes to Bayh's 46%. Making Indiana political history again, Quayle was re-elected to the Senate in 1986 with the largest margin ever achieved to that date by a candidate in a statewide Indiana race, taking 61% of the vote and defeating his Democratic opponent, Jill Long.  In November 1978, Quayle was invited by Congressman Leo Ryan of California to accompany him on a delegation to investigate unsafe conditions at the Jonestown settlement in Guyana, but Quayle was unable to participate. The decision likely saved Quayle's life, because Ryan and his entourage were subsequently murdered at the airstrip in Jonestown as the party tried to escape the massacre.  In 1986, Quayle was criticized for championing the cause of Daniel Anthony Manion, a candidate for a federal appellate judgeship, who was in law school one year above Quayle. The American Bar Association had evaluated Manion as \\"qualified/unqualified\\", its lower passing grade. Manion was nominated for the Seventh Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals by President Ronald Reagan on February 21, 1986, and confirmed by the Senate on June 26, 1986.

Objective: How to clean earbuds Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"In order to evaluate the solution, first, let me present you two possible solutions for cleaning earbuds: Solution 1: 1. Unplug the earbuds from any devices. 2. Gently remove any ear tips or cushions. 3. Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe the exterior of the earbuds. 4. Use a dry cotton swab or soft-bristled toothbrush to clean around the edges and through any grills or openings. 5. Dampen a cloth or cotton swab with rubbing alcohol, and gently clean the metal or plastic connections or any tougher-to-remove debris. 6. Allow the earbuds to dry completely before reassembling and using them. Solution 2: 1. Unplug the earbuds from any devices. 2. Run the earbuds under warm water to loosen any dirt or earwax. 3. Use a soft toothbrush or cotton swab to scrub around the edges and through any grills or openings. 4. Hold the earbuds with the speakers facing down, so any excess water can drain out. 5. Dry the earbuds with a hairdryer on a low setting, with the speakers facing down. 6. Allow the earbuds to dry completely before reassembling and using them.

Instead, it uses a soft, dry cloth, and rubbing alcohol to gently clean the earbuds. 2. Using a soft-bristled toothbrush or cotton swab in Solution 1 ensures precision and gentleness while cleaning the edges and grills of the earbuds, whereas running them under water in Solution 2 could forcefully push dirt or earwax further into the earbuds. 3. Allowing the earbuds to air dry in Solution 1 reduces the risk of heat damage compared to using a hairdryer in Solution 2, which could potentially harm the earbuds' components. Overall, Solution 1 is more careful, gentle, and precise in its approach to cleaning earbuds, making fewer assumptions about the earbuds' tolerance for water and heat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next to that house , they 're just finishing a new apartment building . As I walked by the house , I realized I had n't seen the dog in at least a month . The quiet 's been nice . Answer the following question: Why would the narrator be so happy to be around quiet ?","output":"The narrator might be happy to be around quiet for several reasons. Firstly, constant exposure to noise, such as the barking dog, can be physically and mentally exhausting. Noise pollution has been linked to adverse health effects, including stress, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and even cardiovascular issues. When they realize that they haven't seen or heard the dog in a month, the quiet is a reminder of the relief from the constant noise they had experienced before. Secondly, being around quiet can lead to increased focus and productivity in daily life. When the mind is not distracted by outside noise, it is more capable of concentrating on tasks that require cognitive processing, problem-solving, and planning. The quiet environment presents a sense of peace and tranquility that enables the narrator to function better in their daily life. Thirdly, the quiet may also represent a shift in the neighborhood environment or dynamics. With the new apartment building being constructed, there could be potential changes to the community in terms of demographics, culture, and activities. The absence of the dog's barking may symbolize the evolution of the neighborhood into something more refined and agreeable to the narrator. Another factor could be the narrator's personality and personal preferences. It is possible that they are an introvert, a highly sensitive person (HSP), or someone who simply has a lower tolerance for noise. People with these traits often feel overwhelmed by loud and continuous noise, making them crave quiet environments where they can recharge and feel at ease. The realization that they haven't seen the dog in a month might signify that the narrator's peace has been restored, thus improving their overall mood and well-being. Lastly, the quiet may be the result of the narrator's adaptation to the noise. It is possible that the dog's continued barking over time has led the narrator to consciously or subconsciously repress the noise. In this case, realizing that they haven't seen the dog in a month might come as a pleasant surprise, as they had grown accustomed to the noise and were no longer actively bothered by it. The quiet, then, has become a newfound source of happiness as they are finally able to appreciate the absence of the barking. In conclusion, the narrator is likely happy to be around quiet because it brings relief from the constant noise of the barking dog, offers a more peaceful and focused environment, represents a shift in the neighborhood dynamics, caters to their personal preferences and personality traits, and may even be a newfound source of pleasure after adapting to the noise. The quiet environment, therefore, provides both physical and mental health benefits as well as an overall improvement in the quality of life for the narrator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

You a group of fit, young men, were playing soccer on the field across from my apartment building, I, a beautiful looking young woman, was walking by with my groceries. That's when your ball came flying over the fence and landed at my feet. One of you came to me, and asked politely if I would throw the ball back to you. Fighting the urge to flee screaming down the street, I agreed. And I put my bags down, picked up the ball and with eyes half shut, threw it as hard as I could. It hit the middle of the fence and bounced right back to me. I picked up the ball again and threw the ball upward with all my strength. The ball once again hit slightly higher up on the fence and bounced back to me. This is the point where I start to blame you. Wouldn't it have been a better use of your time, and mine, if you had just walked around the fence and collected the ball then? I was clearly struggling. And yet you all just stood there, staring. Seeing that you weren't  going to get the ball yourselves, I become desperate. But I picked up the soccer ball for the third time. I forced a smile while crying inside as you patiently shouted words of support over the fence at me like I was a two-year-old holding a beech ball for the first time. \\"Throw it granny-style!\\" one of you said. \\"Just back up a little end throw it hard!\\" another offered And, most embarrassing of all, \\"You can do it!\\" I know you thought you were being encouraging, but it only served to deepen the embarrassment. However, I accepted your advice, took a deep breath, and let it fly. It hid the edge of the -fence and bounced back to me. I hoped that I would have a heart attack and pass out, just so I'd be put out of my misery. Alas, the heart attack didn't happen.

Who is the only US president to win the Nobel Peace Prize after leaving office? What is the answer?","output":"To answer your question, I will perform an internet search for US presidents who have received Nobel Peace Prizes, and cross-reference that list with the timing of their respective presidencies to identify if any received the prize post-presidency. Step 1: Search for a list of US presidents who have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Step 2: Identify the dates when these presidents received the prize. Step 3: Determine the dates of their respective presidencies. Step 4: Compare the dates of the Nobel Peace Prize receipt with end dates of presidencies. This will show if any were awarded the prize after leaving office.  Upon searching, four US Presidents have won the Nobel Peace Prize: President Theodore Roosevelt, President Woodrow Wilson, President Jimmy Carter, and President Barack Obama. Cross-referencing the dates of their awards with their presidency terms shows that Roosevelt and Wilson won while in office. Obama won his before his presidency ended. That leaves us with President Jimmy Carter who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, long after his presidency from 1977 to 1981.

It has been called an \\"architectural gem\\" and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's \\"masterpiece\\", the UNESCO World Heritage listed-Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains \\"fine Georgian\\" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the \\"virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end\\", Greenway maintained the classical tradition, unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town-planning.

Information:  - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - Jämtland (Norwegian: \\"Jemtland\\"; Latin: \\"Iemptia\\") or Jamtland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in the center of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders to Härjedalen and Medelpad in the south, Ångermanland in the east, Lapland in the north and Trøndelag and Norway in the west. Jämtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden's total area and is the second largest province in Sweden. It has a population of 112,717, the majority of whom live in \\"Storsjöbygden\\", the area surrounding lake Storsjön. Östersund is Jämtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya.  - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana.  - Christian IV (12 April 1577  28 February 1648), sometimes colloquially referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway, was king of Denmark-Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 to 1648.

It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals.  - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938).  - A personal union is the combination of two or more states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.  - Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and Østfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (Värmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\".  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Akershus Fortress or Akershus Castle is a medieval castle that was built to protect Oslo, the capital of Norway. It has also been used as a prison.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Lysaker is an area in Bærum municipality, Akershus county, Norway. Lysaker is the easternmost part of Bærum, and borders Oslo proper. Lysaker was initially a farming community, later becoming a residential area. Today it is primarily known as a business and trade area, and a public transport hub. It is considered part of Stor-Oslo (Greater Oslo), and is home to offices of numerous domestic and international businesses.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015  25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066. In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066.

It borders the country of Norway as well as the provinces of Dalarna, Hälsingland, Medelpad, and Jämtland. The province originally belonged to Norway, but was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Brömsebro, 1645.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Norse Energy ( OSE : NEC ) is a petroleum and natural gas exploration and production as well as pipeline operator . Though based in Lysaker outside Oslo , Norway the company operates in the United States and Brazil .  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland.  - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\".   - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored.  - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north.  - The Scandinavian Peninsula (;  \\"Skandinavsky poluostrov\\") is a peninsula in Northern Europe, which generally comprises the mainland of Sweden, the mainland of Norway (with the exception of a small coastal area bordering Russia), the northwestern area of Finland, as well as a narrow area in the west of the Pechengsky District of Russia.  - History. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars:  - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Bærum is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. Bærum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. A suburb of Oslo, Bærum is located on the west coast of the city.

Desire to prove themselves: People who have faced hardships or come from difficult backgrounds may have a strong urge to demonstrate their worth, capabilities, and potential to others and themselves. 3. Passion for their work: Many successful people are driven by passion, often viewing their work as not just a way to earn money, but as a means to contribute positively to society or achieve personal fulfillment. 4. Positive role models: Having positive role models or mentors can provide motivation and support for disadvantaged individuals to overcome obstacles and achieve success. 5. Strong work ethic: Individuals who come from tough backgrounds often develop a strong sense of work ethic and persistence, which can be key ingredients for long-term success in any field. 6.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER.

In the first sentence: \\"Suzuki Beane is a humorous book written by Sandra Scoppettone in 1961 and illustrated by Louise Fitzhugh.\\" This sentence accurately states that \\"Suzuki Beane\\" is a humorous book, meaning it is intended to be funny or amusing. The sentence correctly identifies Sandra Scoppettone as the author, which means she wrote the book's text, and Louise Fitzhugh as the illustrator, which means she created the artwork that accompanies the book. This sentence provides the correct information about the book's creator roles. In the second sentence: \\"Suzuki Beane is a humor book written in 1961 by Louise Fitzhugh and illustrated by Sandra Scoppettone.\\" This sentence incorrectly swaps the roles of the two creators. It states that Louise Fitzhugh is the author and Sandra Scoppettone is the illustrator, which is not accurate.

Are the following two questions the same? Why is Sehwag so damn irritating and why do people & media glorify his lameness? Why is drupal so damn complicated? I thought it was to help people who don't know code.","output":"Although both questions involve a complaint or sentiment of dissatisfaction, the two questions are not the same, as they relate to different subjects and areas of expertise. The first question concerns a cricket player named Virender Sehwag and his public persona, whereas the second concerns the Drupal content management system. Here is an extended analysis of both questions: 1. \\"Why is Sehwag so damn irritating and why do people & media glorify his lameness?\\" This question addresses the controversial nature or public image of Virender Sehwag, a former Indian cricketer and one of the most successful openers in international cricket. The individual asking the question seems to find Sehwag's behavior or attitude irritating. It's important to note that people's opinions about public figures are inherently subjective, and what one person sees as irritating or obnoxious in an individual, another might find charismatic or entertaining. In addressing the second part of the question, the promotion of Sehwag's \\"lameness\\" (as the questioner puts it) by people and media might be attributed to several factors: a) Cricket is a popular sport in India, making cricket players celebrities with considerable media attention. b) Controversial or polarizing figures often generate increased media coverage and public discussions. c) Sehwag's accomplishments during his playing career lend credibility to his perspective, even if his views are sometimes seen as controversial. It's worth mentioning that it is normal to have differing opinions on a public figure, as people's perceptions vary based on their own personal experiences, values, and biases. 2. \\"Why is Drupal so damn complicated? I thought it was to help people who don't know code.\\" Drupal is an open-source content management system (CMS) and development platform, designed to help people build and maintain websites without having to write code from scratch. The question here focuses on the perceived complexity of the Drupal system. There are several reasons why Drupal might be seen as \\"complicated\\": a) Steep learning curve: Drupal has a reputation for having a steep learning curve, particularly when compared to CMS platforms like WordPress or Joomla. It requires a deeper understanding of the system and its terminology to effectively build and manage websites with it. b) Flexibility and customization: Drupal is known for its flexibility and high degree of customization potential. This power often results in increased complexity, as users may need to learn site configuration, module integration, and development concepts to fully utilize the platform. c) Growing with technology: As website technologies evolve and user expectations shift, Drupal, like other CMS platforms, continuously updates and improves its features. Sometimes, these changes result in added complexity or require users to learn new approaches to accomplish the desired task. d) Developer-oriented design: While Drupal aims to make website development accessible to non-programmers, the platform does have many developer-friendly tools and features which can contribute to its perceived complexity for those without coding experience. It's important to understand that individual experiences with Drupal, or any CMS platform, will vary based on an individual's background, technical proficiency, and willingness to learn. Some people may find Drupal to be an excellent tool for their needs, while others may have a preferred alternative they find more straightforward or intuitive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening. The training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period. Why was a set training schedule used in a study of training performance of runners? - not enough information - the runners had a regimen to begin with - it was easier to study - it allowed for a more accurate assessment of any changes The answer is:","output":"A set training schedule was used in the study of training performance of runners because it allowed for a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period. By having a consistent and standardized training regimen for each participant, the researchers were able to better control the study variables and systematically evaluate the impact of the different dietary interventions on performance. Using a set training schedule ensured that all the runners followed the same exercise routine, allowing the researchers to eliminate potential variations in the intensity or frequency of training sessions that might have otherwise influenced the results. This uniformity in the training schedule enabled a more reliable comparison of each runner's performance data and facilitated a clearer understanding of the relationship between the antioxidants and potential exercise adaptation. Furthermore, by implementing a fixed training schedule, the study was able to more effectively measure the impact of the dietary interventions on the runners' performance. As every participant adhered to the same exercise regimen, the researchers could confidently attribute any changes in performance to the specific intervention under investigation, rather than differences in the training schedule itself. In summary, a set training schedule was used in the study of training performance of runners because it provided a controlled environment that allowed for a more accurate assessment of the potential changes in performance. This approach minimized the influence of extraneous variables and enhanced the reliability of the findings, ultimately allowing researchers to better understand the effects of antioxidant supplementation on the training adaptations of well-trained female runners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question:   If you keep something whole before putting it into water it will dissolve slower or faster?    Paragraph :  Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, if you keep something whole before putting it into water, it will dissolve slower compared to breaking it into smaller pieces or increasing its surface area.  The paragraph states that \\"increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate.\\" This means that when the surface area of a solid is increased, the solid has more contact with the water, allowing the water to penetrate and dissolve it at a faster rate.  Whenever the surface area is increased, there are more particles exposed to the water at the same time. This results in an increased number of interactions, ultimately driving the dissolution process forward. On the contrary, when a solid object is kept whole, it has a smaller surface area in contact with water, and the penetration process in its depth is slower. Consequently, the overall rate at which the material dissolves is slower. In summary, keeping something whole before putting it into water will result in a slower dissolution process compared to when the object's surface area is increased by breaking it into smaller pieces or crushing it. This is because a larger surface area accelerates the reaction rate by allowing more particles to interact with the water at the same time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen.

Here are the guidelines the task provides: 1. All of the lists are contained within an \\"outer\\" list. 2. Each list inside the outer list contains several numbers, which are positive or negative integers. 3. You are asked to multiply every odd number in each inner list, managing separately each list. 4. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list, you should then output 0 for that particular list. Now, here's how you can approach this task with those guidelines in mind: 1. Start by defining a function to multiply all odd integers in a list. 2. The function should iterate through each integer in the list. For each integer, it should check if it's odd. (An integer is odd if the remainder when dividing by 2 is not zero. You can use the modulus operator \`%\` for this function: \`number % 2 != 0\` will return \`True\` if the number is odd and \`False\` if it's even.) 3. If the integer is odd, it should multiply it with the previous result. It would be best to initialize the result with 1 since multiplying with 1 does not change the number. 4. If the integer is even, it should ignore it and continue to the next integer. 5. If after checking through all the numbers and none is odd, the multiplication result remains 1, the function should then return 0. 6. Now create another function or a loop to apply this function for every inner list in your main list. 7. Collect the result for each list in a new list. This will be your final output, a list of multiplications of odd numbers from each inner list.  By following these steps, you should be able to deliver a list, where each element corresponds to the product of the odd integers in the inner lists from the original input list, or a 0 if there were no odd integers in the corresponding inner lists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She figured that as long as she made some adjustments, perhaps the dishwasher could be a temporary solution to her laundry crisis. Carefully, she began sorting through the pile. She realized that delicate fabrics and certain colors couldn't be washed in the dishwasher; the rough water flow would be too strong for them. The water temperature would also be a factor, so she resorted to the load of clothes that could handle the hot water that the dishwasher usually provided. As she put the clothes in the dishwasher, she felt a sense of excitement at her ingenuity. She was determined to make the best of her situation. After all, her grandmother used to tell her stories about washing clothes in the river, so how bad could this be in comparison? She grabbed the laundry detergent and paused, realizing that the dishwasher would need less soap than a washing machine. With a shake of her head and a wry smile, she poured a small amount of detergent into the designated dishwasher compartment. Then, holding her breath, she pressed the start button. The dishwasher roared to life, its insides whirring and splashing as it moved through the wash cycle. As she waited, she couldn't help but feel a mix of apprehension and hope. Would the clothes emerge clean and fresh, a testament to her clever actions? Or would they be ruined, leaving her to deal with an even more significant disaster than before? Finally, the dishwasher came to a halt, releasing a puff of steam as the door swung open. Nervous, she reached in, pulling out an item of clothing. To her surprise, it was not as terrible as she had feared. The clothes were wet, of course, but otherwise seemed clean and relatively unblemished. Relief washed over her, and she felt a sense of pride. She had managed to overcome a challenge with limited resources, and in the process, had learned something new about her own resourcefulness. With renewed energy, she proceeded to remove the remaining clothes, hanging them around the house to dry. There was a certain sense of satisfaction in seeing the damp clothes hanging on every available surface, their bright colors breathing life into the room. Despite having only wanted a washing machine, she felt fulfilled by her dishwasher-turned-laundry machine. As she returned to her daily routine, she couldn't help but smile. Sometimes, life threw obstacles into her path, and often, they seemed impossible to overcome. But as she'd discovered, in the face of adversity, she could find a way to adapt and grow, even when both options seemed imperfect. And in doing so, she not only conquered the laundry crisis but stumbled upon a newfound sense of innovation and strength within herself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: A fondly-remembered melodrama  thanks chiefly to Ronald Colman's fine Oscar-winning central performance  about an oft-treated theme: the nature of acting and how it can overtake one's perception of reality. In this case, we have a well-known thespian tackling Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\", so that the film's last third delves effectively into the thriller genre  with press agent Edmond O'Brien (who happens to really be besotted with Colman's co-star and ex-wife Signe Hasso) 'investigating' the actor's possible involvement in the Desdemona-like strangling of a celebrity-seeking waitress (a very slim Shelley Winters). The theatrical/New York atmosphere of the immediate post-war era is vividly captured by the husband-and-wife screen writing team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and legendary \\"actor's director\\" George Cukor (all of whom were recognized by the Academy with nominations); incidentally, the film nabbed a second Oscar for Miklos Rozsa's eclectic score. Colman, forever the suave leading man blessed besides with a velvety voice, does well enough by Shakespeare  gaining conviction the farther his character slips into obsessive jealousy, a murderous rage and, eventually, paranoia; however, he is not let down by a supporting cast which also includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer and coroner Whit Bissell.

Given the following context:  The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

Article: Photo      LONDON — Looking for a dead medieval king? You might want to check under a parking lot.      That theory, at least, is on the minds of archaeologists and historians in Reading, about 40 miles west of London, who this week will begin searching for the high altar of the abbey founded by King Henry I. They believe that the altar — and, they hope, the king’s remains — could be under the parking lot of a local prison, near the abbey ruins. The area around a nearby nursery school will also be searched.      Nearly four years ago, archaeologists discovered King Richard III’s grave under a parking lot in Leicester, about 100 miles northwest of London, on the site of a former monastery.      100 Miles SCOTLAND North Sea N. IRELAND BRITAIN Irish Sea IRELAND Leicester ENGLAND WALES London Reading Celtic Sea FRANCE English Channel      Henry I, who ruled from 1100 to 1135, reportedly died after eating lampreys, a kind of jawless fish. A son of William the Conqueror, who ascended to the throne after the death of his elder brother William II, Henry has been described as a usurper because he seized the crown while another elder brother was away on a Crusade. Henry also had a reputation for cruelty; he is said to have had the tips of the noses of two of his granddaughters cut off. But he is also credited with strengthening the monarchy and putting in place efficient — if sometimes oppressive — administrative policies.      John Mullaney, a historian who is part of the team undertaking the search, said that archaeologists knew “within a few yards” where Henry was probably buried. He said the team would use ground-penetrating radar to search the area around the prison, and around a nearby nursery school.      Photo      “We know from burial records that Henry was buried in front of the high altar in the old abbey,” Mr. Mullaney said in a telephone interview. “The aim is to find the footprint of the old abbey. We don’t know if his remains will still be there.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      As to whether a former monarch would roll in his grave at the prospect of spending eternity under a parking lot, Mr. Mullaney was philosophical.      Photo      “I’m afraid that England is a nation of car drivers,” he said. “We are a small country and most people travel by cars, so we need lots of car parks. Henry was a reforming king and would have been fascinated by the idea of cars and transport, and may well have liked being buried under a car park.”      The historian’s wife, Lindsay Mullaney, a linguist and amateur historian who is also involved in the search, said that Henry was a ladies’ man who fathered 24 children outside of marriage. “He was addicted to lust,” she said by telephone. He died in Normandy, which at the time was part of his realm. His decaying body was brought back to Britain and he was buried in Reading Abbey, which, she said, he had hoped would become the mausoleum of future kings.      Mr. Mullaney said that Henry, as a man of learning, would have preferred being buried under a school or, even better, in a place of worship: “He was a religious man and so I think he would have preferred being buried in a church.”      Until Richard III’s bones were discovered in Leicester, his grave had been unmarked for over 500 years. He was buried by men who killed him at the Battle of Bosworth. The bones were transferred, with much ceremony, to a new tomb in Leicester Cathedral in March 2015. ||||| Surveyors have begun scouring the land around the ruins of Reading Abbey, as part of a search that could unearth the missing remains of King Henry I.      Investigators began using ground-penetrating radar on Friday, in a bid to outline the extent of the grounds of the ruined abbey, in a search that could see the body of a second English king discovered beneath a car park.      Henry, who died in 1135, reportedly from a “surfeit of lampreys”, is thought to have been buried alongside his second wife, Adeliza, under the high altar of the abbey, which was largely destroyed during Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries. |||||Summary:","output":"Archaeologists and historians in Reading are searching for the high altar of an abbey founded by King Henry I because they believe the king's remains might be under a local prison's parking lot, near the abbey ruins.

King Henry I ruled a long time ago, from 1100 to 1135, and he was famous for making the government work better. A few years ago, another king, King Richard III, was found under a parking lot too.

It covers an area of approximately 109,965 square kilometers (42,457 square miles) and has an estimated population of over 53 million people, making it the fourth most populous island in the world.  The island is divided into three main regions: Northern Luzon, Central Luzon, and Southern Luzon/Calabarzon. These regions are further subdivided into several provinces, each with its own unique geography, culture, and economy. Some of the provinces in Northern Luzon include Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, and Pangasinan, which are known for their beautiful beaches, historic sites, and agriculturally rich lands. Further to the northeast, you will find the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino, which offer a mix of highlands, plains, and coastal landscapes ideal for agriculture and ecotourism.  Central Luzon houses the provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, and Zambales, as well as Aurora and Bataan. This region is considered the \\"Rice Granary of the Philippines\\" due to its vast fields devoted to rice production, and it also plays a significant role in the country's history, with Bataan being the site of the infamous WWII Bataan Death March and Pampanga being home to several well-preserved colonial-era architecture.  In Southern Luzon, you'll find the highly urbanized Calabarzon region, composed of the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon. This region is a major industrial hub in the Philippines and includes the rapidly growing metropolis of Metro Manila, encompassing the cities of Manila, Quezon City, and many more. Metro Manila serves as the political, economic, social, and cultural center of the country.  Geographically, Luzon boasts impressive landscapes, such as the majestic Mayon Volcano in the Bicol Region, the world-famous rice terraces in Ifugao Province, and Mount Pulag, regarded as the highest peak in Luzon. The island has numerous national parks and protected areas, rich with diverse flora and fauna, such as the Hundred Islands National Park in Pangasinan and the Sierra Madre mountain range that stretches along the eastern coast.

Article: A blue hole is a flooded sea cave with a hole that opens up at the land's surface. These cave systems form in carbonate rock, often on islands. Some blue holes have very special rock formations and water chemistry. Far below sea level, they contain some of the harshest environments on Earth, with no oxygen and no light. Yet these areas are filled with life forms that have adapted to the extreme conditions. Information gathered from these blue holes is helping scientists to increase their understanding of biology, archaeology and geology. But exploring these blue hole environments brings danger as well as discovery.  Blue holes get their name from the color1 some have when seen from the air. The color1 is usually a reflection of the sky on the water. But not all of these cave systems have blue surfaces. Some contain dark or muddy water. Blue holes are the result of erosion in which water breaks down rock. Rain falling thousands of years ago contained chemicals which slowly wore away at the limestone landmass. These holes were later filled with sea water as the sea level changed. The rising and falling of sea levels and the mixture of salt and fresh water further wore away at these cave formations. Blue holes are vertical caves. But they can also have horizontal cave formations that may be hundreds of meters long.  These flooded cave systems can be found in the ocean, or they can be found inland. Ocean caves are affected by tides, so they always have water movement. But blue holes on land are very still. They have several layers of water, chemicals, and bacteria. The top layer of fresh water comes from rainfall. This layer acts like a cap on top of the layered mixture, and keeps out oxygen from the atmosphere. The fresh water floats on a denser layer of saltwater. Underneath this is a layer of poisonous hydrogen sulfide, produced by bacteria living in the water. Underneath this layer is anoxic seawater -- water that does not contain any oxygen.

That makes me happy.” Load apps on one of your devices that promote sleep and/ or meditation. These often have soothing music and images that can distract your mind and relax you. Cognitive reframing is a technique that has you step back from a situation and alter its various aspects. Change out terrifying parts of a bad dream positive images. Reframing the storyline of your bad dream with different and happy images can help you forget its details. In turn, this can help you relax and get back to sleep.  Keep in mind how often you forget dreams in the process of thinking about other things. Reframing your bad dream in alternative terms can help you forget it just as quickly as other dreams. Switch the storyline of the bad dream as soon as you wake up. Remove whatever upsets you by thinking about it or even writing it in a journal you keep next to your bed. This is especially useful because handwriting is closely associated with memory. Replace the bad elements of the dream for something happy and positive. For example, if you dream that a whale capsizes your boat, tell yourself or write, “A giant whale swam next to us and then guided us to a tropical paradise.” Avoid assigning meaning to your dreams as well. Remind yourself that dreams are just a product of your brain’s processing functions. They do not indicate something about you or about the future. Try not to assign meaning to the dream or to try to interpret the dream. If you want to consider the dream further, then do so later on when you are feeling calm. Dim lights can provide comfort in the dark of the night. Turn on your nightlight or small lamp next to your bed as soon as you wake up from a bad dream. This can relax and re-orient you to your surroundings.  Choose a light in a soothing color that won’t stimulate your body to wake up. Hues in the red, yellow, or orange range are the best choices.  Set the light near your bed so that you can turn it on easily when you wake up from a bad dream. If you have a clock in your bedroom or next to your bed, turn it so that you can’t see the time. Watching time pass can make the physical and emotional distress from a bad dream worse.  Ignoring your clock can help you forget the dream and get back to sleep more quickly. What you smell can positively affect your mood and your dreams. If you wake up from a bad dream, place some fresh flowers or an aromatherapy oil next to or near your bed. These may help soothe your thoughts, relax you, and help you fall back asleep. Consider some of the following scents:  Coconut Jasmine Lavender Marjoram Peppermint Rose Vanilla Grounding exercises can help to reduce anxiety and calm yourself down after something frightening has happened. If your bad dream has left you feeling shaken, then doing a grounding exercise may help you to feel better. Most grounding exercises require you to engage with the five senses. A simple exercise that you can do is to name or write:  Five things in the room that you can see. You might see a clock, a picture, your cat, a lamp, and a dresser. Four things you can feel. You might feel the blankets on your skin, your pillow, cool air on your face, and your cat’s fur. Three things you can hear. You might hear a car passing by, your cat purring, and the sound of a fan. Two things you can smell. You might smell the lotion on your arms and the scent of fresh rain coming in through your window. One thing you like about yourself or that other people like. You might note that one good thing about yourself is that you are kind to people. Summary:","output":"To overcome a bad dream, distract your mind by watching peaceful images, changing your environment, or engaging in relaxing activities like reading, watching a funny show, or listening to soft music. Showing love to a pet and talking to them can also help. Use sleep and meditation apps to further relax your mind. Practice cognitive reframing to replace negative dream details with positive imagery. Avoid assigning meaning to dreams and remind yourself they are just brain functions. Turn on a dim light to provide comfort, but avoid looking at the time on your clock. Utilize pleasant scents like lavender and jasmine to create a soothing atmosphere. Finally, perform grounding exercises that engage with your five senses to reduce anxiety and calm yourself after a bad dream."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Because of this, you should wait to open a bottle until you're actually ready to start drinking it. The alcohol in the vodka starts to slowly evaporate once the seal is broken and the bottle is opened. It will take several decades before the opened vodka becomes undrinkable because the alcohol is a preservative. If your vodka is sealed with a cork, make sure the cork is firmly in place since a loose seal could speed up evaporation. If your bottle has a screw top like a cap, make sure it is tightly closed. If the cork or screw top doesn't seem like it will be secure, you may want to store your vodka in a different bottle or container. If you'd like to take vodka with you when you're out and about, store vodka in a flask. Most flasks come with small funnels so you can easily transfer the vodka to the flask. Just be sure to use the vodka or remove it within 3 days since prolonged exposure to the metal in the flask can make your vodka taste metallic.

As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all.

As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core. The system operates like a giant conveyor belt. The motion due to heating and cooling is called convection.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Of course, sweetie! Here's a simpler way to understand it: Imagine you're heating up a pot of soup on the stove. The heat from the stove warms up the soup at the bottom of the pot first. As the soup at the bottom gets hot, it starts to rise towards the top. This is because warm stuff usually likes to go up.  Now, when the hot soup gets to the top, it starts to cool down, because it's further away from the heat of the stove. Cool stuff likes to go down. So, it goes back down to the bottom of the pot to heat up again. This cycle of hot soup rising and cool soup falling is what we call 'convection.'  The same thing happens in the Earth. The inside of the Earth is really hot, kind of like our stove's heat. When the rock deep inside the Earth gets heated up, it rises to the surface. But, when it reaches the top, it cools down and moves aside. Then, it slowly sinks back down to get heated up again. This movement is also a kind of convection - just like in our soup pot. Sometimes, when the heated rock reaches the Earth's top layer, some of it might even break through and ooze out onto the Earth's surface. This is what happens when a volcano erupts!

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Other Types of Chemical Signaling In endocrine signaling, hormones secreted into the extracellular fluid diffuse into the blood or lymph, and can then travel great distances throughout the body. In contrast, autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell. An autocrine (auto= “self”) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it. Interleukin-1, or IL-1, is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in inflammatory response. The cells that secrete IL-1 have receptors on their cell surface that bind these molecules, resulting in autocrine signaling. Local intercellular communication is the province of the paracrine, also called a paracrine factor, which is a chemical that induces a response in neighboring cells. Although paracrines may enter the bloodstream, their concentration is generally too low to elicit a response from distant tissues. A familiar example to those with asthma is histamine, a paracrine that is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree. Histamine causes the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi to constrict, narrowing the airways. Another example is the neurotransmitters of the nervous system, which act only locally within the synaptic cleft.   Q: Autocrine signaling takes place within the same what?

The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sherlock Holmes () is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a \\"consulting detective\\" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard. First appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Details about Sherlock Holmes's life, except for the adventures in the books, are scarce in Conan Doyle's original stories. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.  An estimate of Holmes's age in \\"His Last Bow\\" places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age. His parents are not mentioned in the stories, although Holmes mentions that his \\"ancestors\\" were \\"country squires\\". In \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without further clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes's brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official who appears in \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", \\"The Final Problem\\", and \\"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\\" and is mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\". Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. He lacks Sherlock's interest in physical investigation, however, preferring to spend his time at the Diogenes Club.  Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from fellow university students. A meeting with a classmate's father led him to adopt detection as a profession, and he spent six years after university as a consultant before financial difficulties led him to accept John H. Watson as a fellow lodger in 1881 (when the first published story, A Study in Scarlet, begins).  The two take lodgings at 221B Baker Street, London, an apartment at the upper (north) end of the street, up seventeen steps. Is this about the writer's family and early life?","output":"No, this is about Sherlock Holmes, a made-up detective in stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It tells us a little about Holmes's background, like his family and how he became a detective. The stories are set in the 1800s and early 1900s, and Sherlock Holmes solves mysteries using his skills in observing things, understanding science, and thinking very logically."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew.

Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent.

Since it is such a cultural change, it may be that the present generation of journalists and publishers will have to die off before the next generation realize that the newspaper industry is no longer a newspaper industry. Technology is making the end of traditional newspapers unavoidable. Despite technological advances, it could take decades to replace news-print with computer screens. It might take 30 to 40 years to complete the changeover because people need to buy computers and because newspapers have established financial  interests in the paper industry. Answer:","output":"Which of the following statements about the future of newspapers is true, according to the article? A. Traditional newspapers will completely disappear within 10 years due to technology. B. Future newspapers will be accessible through TV channels. C. Computer newspapers will integrate print and broadcast reporting, offering news with video images. D. The changeover to computer newspapers will happen immediately as all the necessary technology is already available. Correct answer: C. Computer newspapers will integrate print and broadcast reporting, offering news with video images."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. The following article contains an answer for the question: What song opens with a fade-in bass section? , can you please find it?   \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus.  It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". \\"Orion\\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with...","output":"The song \\"Orion\\" is a multipart instrumental that opens with a fade-in bass section. This song highlights Burton's bass playing skills."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

So, his first name is Danny. Think of it like he's a cool guy named Danny, who wears a leather jacket and loves to dance and sing in the movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. A big identifier of your character will be their name. Think about people you know in real life who remind you of the character or who inspired the character. You can also play on an existing name you feel fits with the character and change the spelling. For example, Kris instead of Chris, or Tara instead of Tanya.  Look for names that fit with your character's background and don't seem odd in terms of your character's role or position. A soccer mom who lives in suburban Portland and identifies as Caucasian is likely not going to be named Esmeralda. And an evil sorcerer from another planet will likely not be named Joe or Craig. There are several character name generators online that you can also use, filtering by background and gender. If your character was to fill out a census or a form at a doctor's office, what would they specify for gender, age, height, and weight? Though you may not use this character information in your story or novel, your character's gender, and age will affect their character voice and their point of view. For example, the young child character, Scout, in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird will view the world of the novel differently than her father, Atticus Finch, an older man. It's important to specify your character's physical characteristics, especially their hair and eye color. Often, description of characters focuses on hair color or eye color, and these details can help signal to your reader that your character has a certain ethnic background or appearance. These descriptions can also indicate a certain type of character. For example, describing your character's physical appearance as: “She had dishwater blonde hair and gray eyes that glazed over when she was bored” not only gives your reader a clear physical description, it also shows the character's personality. Harry Potter's lightning bolt scar is a good example of a distinguishing marker that identifies his character and makes him unique. You can also use birthmarks, like a mole on your character's face, or a marker due to an accident, like a burn mark or a scar due to stitches. These scars or markers can make your character feel distinct to your reader. They can also tell the reader more about your character.  In To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout's brother Jem is characterized on the first page of the novel through a description of his broken arm: “When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn't have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.”  Harper Lee uses the injury, or physical marker, to introduce Jem's character and tell the reader that he has a shorter left arm, a distinguishing characteristic that makes him a more nuanced and believable character. Clothing can be a great way to show the reader more of your character's personality and preferences. A character who wears punk t-shirts, black jeans, and Doc Martens will come across as a rebellious character, while a character who wears a sweater set and loafers may come across as a more conservative character.  Be specific when you are describing a character's clothing, but don't repeat descriptions too much in the narrative. Establishing your character's style of dress once will create a clear picture in the reader's mind that they can refer back to. In Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, the main character Philip Marlowe describes his clothing in two concise sentences: “I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it.”  Chandler uses very specific detail to paint a clear image of Marlowe and he injects the description with Marlowe's voice, “I didn't care who knew it,” adding more depth to the description. Your character's station in life will affect how she navigates certain situations and how she will react to everyday occurrences. A young African American man living in Washington, D.C. will have a different experience or perspective than a young Southern man living in Little Rock, Arkansas. And a middle class woman living in New York will have different daily experience than a woman living on food stamps in New York. Your character's background and class experience will be an integral part of their perspective as a character.  Though it is not essential that you announce your character's background and class to the reader, your character will feel more realistic and true if their station in life factors into their point of view. The characters in the fiction of Junot Diaz, for example, uses colloquial terms that indicate class and background to the reader. In Diaz's short story “The Cheater's Guide to Love” he notes: “Maybe if you'd been engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita you could have survived it—but you're not engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita. Your girl is a bad-ass salcedense who doesn't believe in open anything; in fact, the one thing she warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive, was cheating.”  In this story, Diaz uses Spanish terms to indicate the character/narrator's background, without having to tell the reader directly that the narrator is Spanish. Another way to make your character more believable on the page is to delve into the details of their profession or career. If you are writing a character who works as an architect, this character should know about how to design a building and may see a city skyline in a unique way. Or if you are writing a character who works as a private detective, this character should know basic P.I. protocol and how to solve a case. Use library books and online sources to make your character's career convincing in your story. If possible, try to speak to someone who is in the profession you would like to use for your character. Interview them about their daily habits at work to make sure you are getting the details of their profession right. Summary:","output":"To create a believable character, think about their name, appearance, and background. You can use real-life inspiration or change the spelling of existing names. Describe your character's physical features, like hair and eye color, and include any unique marks or scars. Clothing can also show personality, so describe their style of dress. Consider your character's background and class, and how it affects their perspective. Learn about their profession to include accurate details in your story, and talk to people in that profession if possible. These elements will help make your character more realistic and interesting."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Drunken driving--sometimes called America's socially accepted form of murder--has become a national epidemic . Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter  has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing  a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition  of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution. Question: In America, public opinion about drunken driving has changed because   _  . Options: A: judges are no longer serious B: new laws are introduced in some states C: the problem has attracted public attention D: drivers do not appreciate their manly image A:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question and identify the key points from the article. The article discusses the issue of drunken driving in America and how public opinion has changed over time, particularly due to well-publicized tragedies involving young children. Step 2: Analyze each option and find the one that matches with the key points identified from the article. Option A: \\"judges are no longer serious\\" - The article states that judges used to be more lenient because heavy drinking was associated with a \\"manly image,\\" but it doesn't say that judges being lenient causes the public opinion change. Option B: \\"new laws are introduced in some states\\" - Although the introduction of new laws is a consequence of the changing public opinion, it is not the cause of the change itself. Option C: \\"the problem has attracted public attention\\" - The article highlights how well-publicized tragedies, especially those involving young children, have led to a shift in public opinion, which matches with this option. Option D: \\"drivers do not appreciate their manly image\\" - This option contradicts the article, which says that heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image. Step 3: Choose the answer that best aligns with the information from the article. Based on the analysis of the options, the correct answer is C: the problem has attracted public attention. This is because the well-publicized tragedies mentioned in the article have raised public awareness and led to a shift in public opinion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Demetrious is conducting chemical reactions for his community college chemistry laboratory course. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide.  Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate?  Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. A:","output":"Reaction A will occur at a faster rate. Justification: As the hint provided suggests, an increase in surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. This is because there is more area for the reactant to be in contact with the reaction environment, thereby increasing the chance of reactant molecules colliding with one another and forming products. In Reaction A, Demetrious is using sodium oxide in the form of small particles. Due to their small size, these particles have a larger surface area compared to chunks of the same total weight. In Reaction B, Demetrious is using sodium oxide in the form of large chunks. These chunks have less surface area compared to small particles of the same total weight. By this logic, since smaller particles have a higher surface area and can therefore react more quickly than bigger chunks, Reaction A, where sodium oxide is used in the form of small particles, will occur at a faster rate compared to Reaction B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We see colors on our clothes, in our crayons, and even in the sky. Did you know, you can mix colors to make new ones? Blue and yellow make green, and red and blue make purple! Go ahead and try mixing colors with your paint or crayons and create magical new shades! 2. Animals: Animals are our furry, feathery, or scaly friends who live with us on Earth. There are big animals like elephants and small ones like ants. Some animals live in water, like fish, while others fly in the sky, like birds. We can learn about different animals, their sounds, and what they like to eat. This way, we understand and care for them better. 3. Shapes: Shapes are the outlines of things that we see. There are many different shapes, like circles, squares, and triangles. You can find shapes everywhere: your sandwich might be a square, and your ball is a circle. Try looking for shapes all around you. You can even draw shapes with your crayons. It's fun to see how many different shapes you can find! 4. Plants: Plants are green, leafy friends who help us breathe fresh air. They grow in the ground, in pots, and even in water! Some plants make beautiful flowers, while others give us yummy fruits and vegetables to eat. You can learn about different types of plants and how to take care of them by giving them water, sunlight, and love. 5. Weather: Weather is what it feels like outside. Sometimes it's sunny and warm, while other days it's rainy and cold. Weather can change from morning to night and also with the seasons. We can learn about the different types of weather, like sunshine, rain, snow, and wind. This way, we know what to wear and how to stay safe when the weather changes. Now that you know about these fun topics, you can \\"tell me about it\\" to your family and friends. Sharing what we learn makes us smarter, happier, and helps us make new friends too.

Write a summary based on this article: A machine used for FDA-approved imaging of the brain to diagnose and treat Alzheimer's. (Photo: USA TODAY)      To confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimer's today, a patient either needs a painful spinal tap or a costly brain image. But several detection tools under development offer the promise of at least ruling out Alzheimer's easily and inexpensively in a doctor's office.      In new research to be presented this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Denmark, scientists show progress developing detection methods that rely on the blood, sense of smell and protein build-up in the eyes. All have been tested in dozens to hundreds of patients.      \\"Those are now moving into the more serious realm,\\" said Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer's Association. \\"So we're very excited about this.\\"      Among people with mild memory problems, a reduced sense of smell effectively predicted who would go on to get Alzheimer's, according to one study to be presented today. Also, older, healthy people were more likely to have memory declines if they scored lower on a smell test, said Davangere Devanand, a psychiatrist and director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at Columbia University.      Other studies include one suggesting that a device the size of a desktop computer can detect Alzheimer's by looking at the lens of a patient's eye. Beta amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, is detectable in the lens, potentially before symptoms appear, said Paul Hartung, president and CEO of the Massachusetts-based company Cognoptix that is developing the device.      And in another study reported recently, researchers at King's College London and UK proteomics company, Proteome Sciences, found that a panel of 10 proteins in the blood can help identify people with the brain shrinkage that is characteristic of mild memory loss and Alzheimer's.      None of these tests is likely to be perfect predictors of Alzheimer's, though, said Ralph Nixon, chairman of the Alzheimer's Association's Medical & Scientific Advisory Council, and a professor of psychiatry and cell biology at New York University School of Medicine. Everyone with Alzheimer's has beta amyloid in their brain, but not everyone with beta amyloid buildup will develop Alzheimer's, limiting the predictive ability of some of these tests.      Their best use may be to help flag people who need costlier testing, or to quickly rule out Alzheimer's as a cause of symptoms, said Devanand, who does not expect the smell test to be definitive.      The other long-term hope is that these sensory and blood tests may be able to predict Alzheimer's risk long before symptoms appear. In recent years, trials of drugs to change the course of Alzheimer's have all been failures. Researchers believe that's because the drugs are given after too much damage has occurred – but right now, they can't identify the disease any earlier.      Earlier diagnosis offers the possibility of treating people sooner, when medications may be more effective, said Matthew Growdon, a medical student at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. At the conference Growdon will also present research on the link between odor identification and the biological characteristics of Alzheimer's.      The smell test is a 15 to 20 minute quiz in which the participant has to scratch and sniff one box at a time and identify its odor from among four options such as pizza, gasoline, apple and chocolate. The scents are intentionally different because many people would have trouble with more subtle distinctions – say, between and apple and a strawberry. And, the test is meant to be easy, Devanand said.      By itself, a lousy sense of smell doesn't predict Alzheimer's – so people shouldn't worry if they don't discern smells as well as a family member, Devanand said. Respiratory infections, allergies, smoking and other factors can all reduce smelling ability.      \\"It is not as if, if you score poorly, you are sure to have Alzheimer's,\\" he said.

That number is expected to increase dramatically in the decades ahead.      On Sunday, researchers announced the promising results of a study on a new test to pick up on the disease years - if not decades - in advance. And they're looking for signs in an unusual place: the eye.      These bright dots are proteins called beta amyloids visible in the retina of a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's diseases.      Beta amyloids are typically found in the brain and have been known to be linked to Alzheimer's.      Dr. James Galvin is a neurologist at New York University Langone Medical Center.      \\"What makes it unique is that the retina is actually an extension of the brain and so we think that a lot of the pathology that is occurring in the brain may also be occurring in the retina,\\" he said.      CBS News      Australian researcher Shaun Frost tested 40 people using a liquid form of curcumin, the natural substance that makes curry yellow. Curcumin sticks to beta amyloids, allowing doctors to spot the proteins with a simple eye test.      Frost found that the test positively identified 100 percent of the participants who had Alzheimer's.      Alzheimer's so far is incurable, so why is it important to be able to detect it?      \\"Well, for several reasons. So we have medicines today that treat the symptoms of the disease, so you'd like to be able to pick up the disease as soon as possible, so you can start someone on an available medicine. But more importantly, in order to develop new therapies, we need to be able to identify people at the earliest stages,\\" said Galvin.      Currently, the disease is detected through spinal taps or PET scans, which are invasive, expensive and not readily available.      The developers of the eye test say it can predict the onset of Alzheimer's 15 to 20 years before clinical diagnosis. The full study, involving 200 subjects, is expected to be completed earlier this year. |||||","output":"Researchers have been developing new detection methods for Alzheimer's that rely on blood, sense of smell, and protein build-up in the eyes.

Question: The answer to the question: What were the names of the bands who were specifically designated \\"new wave\\"? is inside the article: In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—\\"New Wave\\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \\"punk\\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\". New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. However, the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The bands specifically designated \\"new wave\\" according to the article are Blondie, Talking Heads, the Cars, the Go-Go's, and the Police.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What most naturally follows? How to stop ogling  Follow the three-second rule.  It's natural to glance at people as they walk by you, and a quick glance is usually okay. But if you find yourself looking for longer than 3 seconds, you're ogling.","output":"To stop ogling, it is essential to understand why it is essential to do so and to implement practical strategies to control your gaze. Ogling can make the person you are staring at feel uncomfortable and objectified, leading to an unhealthy environment. Here are some practical steps you can take to stop this behavior: 1. Acknowledge the issue: The first step to stop ogling is to admit that you have a problem. Recognize that it is inappropriate, disrespectful, and potentially offensive to those you stare at. Accepting that you need to change your behavior will help you move forward. 2. Practice self-awareness: Pay attention to your behaviors and actions, especially in social situations. Be aware of where your eyes are looking, and consciously choose to look away or engage in conversation if you find yourself ogling. 3. Develop empathy: Put yourself in the shoes of the person you are ogling. Imagine how uncomfortable and uneasy it would make you feel to have someone staring at you. Empathizing with the other person will help you understand the impact of your actions and make it easier to control your gaze. 4. Engage in conversation: If you find yourself ogling someone, try starting a conversation with them, focusing on their thoughts and opinions rather than their appearance. This can help you see them as more than just a physical object and train your brain to focus on their personality. 5. Redirect your focus: When you feel the urge to ogle, shift your focus to something else. This could mean looking around the room, focusing on your drink or a book, or even just thinking about something else entirely. The goal is to distract yourself from the desire to stare. 6. Use visualization techniques: Visualization techniques can help you train your brain to avoid ogling. Start by visualizing yourself in a situation where you would usually ogle, then imagine yourself behaving respectfully and appropriately instead. Over time, this practice can help you to change your behavior in real-life situations. 7. Set goals and track progress: Set goals for yourself to reduce or eliminate ogling, and evaluate how well you are progressing regularly. Keep a journal or a record of your progress to ensure you are on the right track and make adjustments if needed. 8. Seek support: Confiding in a friend or family member about your desire to stop ogling can hold you accountable and provide encouragement and motivation throughout the process. It also helps surround yourself with positive role models and engage in social activities where respectful behavior is the norm. 9. Practice mindfulness and meditation: Mindfulness exercises and meditation can help improve self-awareness and control over your thoughts and actions. Spending time each day practicing mindfulness or meditation can help you stay focused and make better choices in your daily life, including avoiding ogling. 10. Seek professional help if necessary: If you find that your ogling is impacting your relationships or daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide personalized guidance to help you overcome your tendencies and develop healthier habits. By taking these steps to stop ogling, you can cultivate a more respectful and considerate attitude towards others, leading to healthier and more fulfilling social interactions. Remember that changing ingrained habits can take time, so be patient and keep working on it."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the album \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on? is inside the article: The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single.

The study indicated that there was a discernible gender difference in the prevalence of smoking among the students. The finding of the study show that more males than females began smoking when they were in primary and high schools whereas most females started smoking after high school.

Sentence 2: The speaker is expressing that the situation isn't so bad. There might be some level of badness, but it's not that significant. Step 2: Compare the meanings of the sentences Both sentences convey the idea that the situation is not as bad as it could have been. Sentence 1 emphasizes a change in opinion/thought, while Sentence 2 conveys an overall sentiment about the situation. Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between the two sentences If Sentence 1 is true, it means that the speaker no longer thinks the situation is as bad as they originally thought. This implies that the speaker now has a more positive or less negative view of the situation. If Sentence 2 is also true, it means the speaker believes the situation isn't so bad. This also indicates a less negative view of the situation. Step 4: Determine the truth of Sentence 2 based on Sentence 1 Since both sentences convey a less negative view of the situation, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also likely to be true.

Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations.

If you're looking for an inexpensive, tasty lunch in the Strip at a sit down restaurant, give Chicken Latino a try!  I came here for lunch today with a friend, and we ordered the half Peruvian rotisserie chicken, yucca fries, and fried plantains, which was more than enough for the two of us.  I also had a bottle of Inca Cola, which I hadn't had since studying abroad in Quito in 2006.  We enjoyed the chicken, which I found tender and well-seasoned, particularly on the skin, particularly with the green sauce, which we mixed with mayo to cut the spiciness.  The yucca fries were also great with the sauce.  I wasn't as much of a fan of the plantains (too sweet), but this is probably an idiosyncratic matter, since I don't really care for bananas much.  All this food set us back about 20, which is pretty inexpensive for a sit down meal, though there is cheaper street food to be had nearby.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful, helping us make decisions by making  suggestions.  I also enjoyed the wall hangings, which reminded me of the textiles available at indigenous markets in Ecuador.  One suggestion for improvement would be to have mayo available in squeeze bottles, similar to the green sauce, since tearing open packets is a pain and creates unnecessary waste.

Q:Given the background: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  and the situation: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.  Answer the following question: Which species would decrease in number, species A and species B? A:","output":"Species B would likely decrease in number over time. Since species A has helpful traits that contribute to better survival and reproduction, these traits would become more common in the population due to natural selection. On the other hand, species B has harmful traits that are not advantageous for survival or reproduction. As a result, organisms with these harmful traits would be less likely to survive and reproduce, leading to a decrease in the number of species B individuals over time. This aligns with the principles of natural selection and adaptation outlined in the theory of evolution by Darwin and Wallace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Sunset Boulevard (stylized onscreen as SUNSET BLVD.) is a 1950 American film noir directed and co-written by Billy Wilder, and produced and co-written by Charles Brackett. It was named after the thoroughfare that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, California. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter, and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded silent-film star who draws him into her fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. The street known as Sunset Boulevard has been associated with Hollywood film production since 1911, when the town's first film studio opened there. The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the star system, luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.  As a young man living in Berlin in the 1920s, Billy Wilder was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \\"the parade had passed them by\\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.  The character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existence of Mary Pickford and the mental disorders of Mae Murray and Clara Bow. It is usually regarded as a fictional composite inspired by several different people, not just a thinly disguised portrait of one in particular. Nevertheless, some commentators have tried to identify specific models. One asserts that Norma Talmadge is \\"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\\" of the film. The most common analysis of the character's name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress Mabel Normand and director William Desmond Taylor, a close friend of Normand's who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press.

Katy Perry Battles Nuns to Buy Los Angeles Convent : People.com 06/29/2015 AT 05:50 PM EDT has her eye on purchasing a one-time convent, but its nuns are having none of it. The California Institute of the Sisters of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary are at odds over who has the legal right to sell their former convent with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Per court documents, the five remaining sisters recently sold the villa-style property to interior designer and urban developer Dana Hollister, while the Archdiocese had a 14.5 million deal in the works with Perry. Perry has reportedly had her eye on the real estate for three years, and when the diocese told the remaining nuns they had lined up a buyer, they did a quick Google search on the singer. \\"Well, I found Katy Perry, and I found her videos and ... if it's all right to say, I wasn't happy with any of it,\\" Sister Rita Callanan, 77, Sister Rita also watched the performer's in February. Between the song selection's mildly suggestive lyrics (her set included \\"I Kissed a Girl,\\" \\"Teenage Dream,\\" \\"California Gurls\\" and a twerk-tastic Missy Elliot medley) and her ), Sister Rita was left scratching her head. \\"I thought, is that a way to make money?\\" she added to the . \\"Maybe I could fly around.

Please answer this question: What city, founded around 1048 by King Harald III, was largely destroyed by fire and rebuilt from 1624 by King Christian IV and named Christiania, and reverted to its original name in 1925?","output":"The city you're referring to is Oslo, which is the capital and the most populous city of Norway. Oslo was initially founded around 1048 by King Harald III, who was also known as Harald Hardråde (or Harald Hardrada in English). The site of the original settlement was located at the eastern end of the Oslo Fjord, which provided an ideal natural harbor and strategic location for trade and defense. In 1624, a devastating fire swept through the city, leaving most of it in ruins. Recognizing the importance of rebuilding the city, King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway ordered its reconstruction on a new site, slightly west of the original location. The city was then renamed Christiania, in honor of the monarch. The new city was laid out with broader streets and constructed primarily with stone and brick to minimize the risk of future fires. Later, in 1877, the spelling of the city's name was altered to \\"Kristiania.\\" For a long time, Christiania maintained its status as the political, economic, and cultural center of Norway. However, following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, a growing sentiment of nationalism took hold, and many Norwegians longed to reconnect with their historical roots. This movement eventually led to the city's name being reverted to its original name, Oslo, in 1925. Today, Oslo is a thriving city known for its vibrant culture, rich history, and beautiful surrounding landscapes. It houses the Royal Palace, the Norwegian Parliament, and various important museums like the Viking Ship Museum, the Munch Museum, and the Nobel Peace Center. Furthermore, Oslo has a reputation for its green spaces, such as the Vigeland Park and the Ekebergparken Sculpture Park, along with its beautiful waterfront promenade, Aker Brygge. In conclusion, the city that was founded around 1048 by King Harald III, destroyed by fire and rebuilt by King Christian IV as Christiania, and ultimately reverted to its original name, Oslo, in 1925, is a significant urban center in Norway with a fascinating history and an enduring legacy as the country's capital."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Corky was a brave young man and he dreamed of becoming the best fighter in the world. To become stronger and get better fighting skills, he went to many schools. One day, he went to the best school in the world. Before entering the gate, he was made to hand in all his weapons  . \\"You won't need those any more. Here you'll get better ones,\\" said the guard. Corky handed his weapons to him. A serious old teacher took Corky to his room. Before he left, he said to Corky, \\"In a hundred days the training will start.\\" A hundred days! At first Corky thought that was a joke, but he soon realized the old teacher had been serious. Corky felt nervous during the first days and he tried many ways to try to get the teacher to start the training. However, it didn't work. At last Corky waited patiently and enjoyed each day in the school. \\"You've already learned how to use your main weapon - patience,\\" said the old teacher. Corky could hardly believe it, but he really understood that the teacher was right. Finally, the lesson began. \\"Now it's time to learn how to win every fight,\\" said the old teacher. That sounded good to Corky until he found himself tied hand and foot. Many villagers tried to hit him because they were told that Corky was a dangerous man. The same thing was repeated for days, and Corky knew he had to do something. He realized that the only way would be to deal with the villagers' anger  . In the following days, Corky kept talking to them until he managed to make them believe that he was not an enemy. In the end, the villagers made friends with Corky. Finally, Corky knew what the most powerful weapon was. He said thanks to the teacher and left. Question: Why did the old teacher tell Corky that the training would start in a hundred days? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The old teacher told Corky that the training would start in a hundred days as a lesson in patience. This was a part of his teaching methods. The extended time frame was not necessarily meant for physical training but for mental training. By making him wait, the teacher was training Corky to develop patience and learn to enjoy each day despite the anticipation and uncertainty. This aspect of patience, as the teacher later explained, was a key weapon for Corky to master first before his actual combat training began. It was a critical part in shaping Corky's mindset and approach towards his goal of becoming a fighter, hinting at the understanding that not all battles are won through physical strength alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points.

As the hint suggests, saturated hydrocarbons are called alkanes, and they have the general naming structure ending in \\"-ane.\\" Joe specifically studied alkanes, and as mentioned, ethane is the second smallest alkane with two carbon atoms. Given that Joe's studies were focused on alkanes, it is likely that ethane was part of his curriculum.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What singer was going to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman?  During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years. In a review of the album Kylie for AllMusic, Chris True described the tunes as \\"standard, late-80s ... bubblegum\\", but added, \\"her cuteness makes these... Answer:","output":"The singer who was going to work with the producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman is Kylie Minogue. Minogue had risen to fame previously as an actress on the television show \\"Neighbours\\", but it was her musical performance at the Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert that caught the attention of Mushroom Records. Subsequently, she was signed to the said label in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion,\\" proved to be a major success in her home country of Australia, spending seven weeks at number one on the singles charts. Due to this initial success, Minogue was sent to England by Gary Ashley, an executive from Mushroom Records, to work with the renowned producing trio Stock, Aitken & Waterman. Her time working with them led to the creation of her hit, \\"I Should Be So Lucky,\\" a song that was written while she was waiting outside of the studio as the producers had forgotten about her appointment. Despite this almost comedic oversight, the song was a major success, reaching number one in several countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Israel, which further established her as a prominent figure in the music industry. In July 1988, her debut album, \\"Kylie,\\" was released which was essentially a collection of dance-oriented pop music. The album had a long run on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. It also did well in the United States, where it went gold. To further her music career, Minogue left the show \\"Neighbours\\" later that same year. Her collaboration with Jason Donovan on the song \\"Especially for You\\" became yet another number-one hit in the UK and eventually sold its one millionth copy in December 2014.

If So we all have benefited indirectly., can we conclude that \\"Nobody has benefited, not even indirectly.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Nobody has benefited, not even indirectly\\" from the statement \\"So we all have benefited indirectly.\\" In fact, these two statements contradict each other and convey entirely opposite implications. The first statement, \\"So we all have benefited indirectly,\\" suggests that everyone involved has experienced some sort of positive effect or gain, albeit not in a direct manner. Indirect benefits can occur through various connections or events, which ultimately lead to an advantageous outcome for those concerned. This indicates that there is a network of benefits and advantages at play that are being channeled through multiple layers, ultimately reaching everyone involved or impacted. For instance, if a company generates more revenue and in turn, provides higher salaries and better facilities for its employees, the local economy in which those employees reside will experience positive changes too. In contrast, the statement \\"Nobody has benefited, not even indirectly\\" implies that no individual or group has experienced any advantages, either directly or indirectly. This could be due to a lack of overall positive outcomes in a given situation or that the negative consequences outweigh any possible benefits, rendering them negligible. This statement conveys a more pessimistic viewpoint that nothing positive has emerged or been experienced in one's environment or interactions. Therefore, to conclude that \\"Nobody has benefited, not even indirectly\\" is directly contradicted by the initial statement that \\"So we all have benefited indirectly.\\" The two ideas oppose each other and cannot coexist in the same context. It is essential to carefully analyze and understand the context and the reasons behind each statement to form an appropriate understanding of a given situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The proposal aimed to bring more money into the game and establish a top division with commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League. This led to the creation of the FA Premier League.  To give some background, club owners and stakeholders had been discussing the idea of breaking away from the existing Football League system to generate more revenue. The key turning point came when the Founder Members Agreement was signed on 17 July 1991 by the top-flight clubs, which established the foundational principles for the new FA Premier League. This new league provided clubs with the ability to negotiate their own broadcast and sponsorship agreements, opening up the potential for significant financial growth. The main argument given at the time was that the additional income would enable English clubs to compete effectively with teams across Europe. As a result, the proposal in 1991 was not postponed.

Now let's examine the remaining choices: - Dining hall: While dining halls may offer wide food choices, the presence of a bar stool suggests a more casual environment typically found in a restaurant, rather than a communal dining setup. - Kitchen: A kitchen is primarily a functional space for cooking rather than a public establishment for individuals to dine. - Restaurant: This choice best fits the given information. Restaurants provide meals, often in a casual and comfortable environment, and can include seating at a bar or counter. Not all restaurants serve alcohol, and those that choose not to focus on their food offerings. Taking all of this into account, the most appropriate answer is \\"restaurant,\\" as it accurately reflects the atmosphere, food options, and lack of alcohol described in the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Next question: who plays merlin in transformers the last night?","output":"In the 2017 film \\"Transformers: The Last Knight\\", the character of Merlin, the legendary wizard of Arthurian legend, is portrayed by talented British actor Stanley Tucci. Stanley Tucci was born on November 11, 1960, in Peekskill, New York, USA. He is renowned for his extensive work both in film and television.  Before his appearance in \\"Transformers: The Last Knight,\\" Tucci had already built a strong reputation in Hollywood through his diverse roles in a variety of genres. Some of his notable works include \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" (2006), where he played the character of Nigel, \\"Julie & Julia\\" (2009) as Paul Child, and \\"The Hunger Games\\" film series (2012-2015), in which he portrayed Caesar Flickerman.  In \\"Transformers: The Last Knight,\\" directed by Michael Bay, Stanley Tucci's Merlin is depicted as an eccentric and somewhat comical character who plays a crucial role in the storyline involving the Transformers' history with the knights of King Arthur's court. Merlin uses his alleged magical abilities, which were, in fact, advanced technology provided by the Transformers, to help King Arthur and his knights in their fight against their foes. Besides Stanley Tucci, the film stars Mark Wahlberg, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Hopkins, Laura Haddock, and Isabela Moner, among others. The movie, which is the fifth installment of the live-action Transformers film franchise, offers a blend of action, adventure, and science fiction as it delves into a tale of ancient legends, hidden relics, and clashing forces vying for control over Earth's fate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: The statistics I've cited and the living examples are all too familiar to you.

This woman may be equipped with professional skills and perhaps valuable experience. She will not be content to be Executive Assistant to Mr. Seldom Seen of the Assistant Vice President's Girl Friday, who is the only one who comes in on Saturday. She is the symbol of what I call the Second Wave of Feminism. She is the modern woman who is determined to be. Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life. The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict. What is the stereotyped role of American women?

This perspective was primarily based on the belief that men had created a domestic, servile role for women in order to retain control over the career and decision-making opportunities in society. Throughout history, women were considered oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because men chose to exploit their wives and the mothers of their children. This exploitation could be deliberate or could result from the ignorance of not examining the underlying societal assumptions and pretensions.

I am truly grateful for all the experiences and memories that football has given me.\\" Beckham's journey to fame began when he made his debut for Manchester United back in 1992. Over the years, he collected six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, and the coveted UEFA Champions League trophy while playing for the Red Devils. His move to Real Madrid in 2003 only served to enhance his global appeal and strengthen his brand. Not only was he an integral part of the famed \\"Galácticos,\\" alongside Ronaldo, Zidane, and Figo, but he also aided in securing the 2006-2007 La Liga title for Los Blancos. Beckham then ventured across the Atlantic to join MLS side, LA Galaxy, where his impact on American soccer was immense. Despite facing initial struggles, he eventually led the team to back-to-back MLS Cups in 2011 and 2012. Throughout his career, Beckham created various highlight-worthy moments both on and off the pitch. Most notably, his spectacular goals - including his famous halfway line goal for Manchester United against Wimbledon - not only showcased his immense talent but also etched his name in football history. In addition to his club success, David Beckham had a storied international career where he earned 115 caps for England and represented his country in three World Cups. He often embraced the responsibility of wearing the captain's armband, leading England with passion and determination. Outside of football, Brand Beckham has indeed become a worldwide phenomenon. David and Victoria Beckham have become fashion and style icons, attracting attention from various industries. From fragrances to fashion lines, they have built a business empire that showcases their savvy entrepreneurial skills. Endorsement deals and collaborations with major brands such as Adidas, H&M, and Armani only further solidify their status as global influencers.

Write a text based on this summary: nato chief wants mature relationship with russia Text:","output":"NATO Chief Calls for a Mature Relationship with Russia: A Step Toward Reducing Global Tensions In recent years, the relationship between NATO and Russia has been marred with tensions and uncertainty. NATO, a political and military alliance formed in response to the security concerns that arose in the aftermath of World War II, has been trying to ensure the stability and security of its member states. Russia, being a major global power with its military might and regional influence, has a significant bearing on NATO's decisions and efforts to maintain peace in Europe and other regions. Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General, in a bid to reduce tensions and foster a stable and secure environment, has emphasized the need for establishing a mature relationship with Russia. This call comes at a time when both NATO and Russia are faced with emerging challenges, such as cyber threats, geopolitical shifts, and the growing influence of non-state actors. A mature relationship between the two entities would require abandoning the historical animosity that has impeded cooperation and mutual understanding in the past. A mature relationship between NATO and Russia would entail respectful dialogue, a willingness to see each other's point of view, and maintaining open communication channels. It would also involve replacing Cold War-era hostility with a cooperative approach to address contemporary issues, such as counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and non-proliferation. For NATO, improving its relationship with Russia entails demonstrating its commitment to the mutual resolution of conflicts and taking concrete steps to address Russia's security concerns. Building trust with Moscow could result in Russia re-examining its perspective on NATO’s eastward expansion, missile defense systems, and other strategic moves – issues that have been sources of contention between the two parties. Simultaneously, NATO needs to continue upholding its commitment to the security of its member states and ensuring that they are not subject to undue pressure or intimidation from any external forces, including Russia. On the Russian side, demonstrating a genuine willingness to engage in meaningful dialogue and be open to compromise will be crucial in building a mature relationship with NATO. Russia needs to demonstrate its commitment to adhering to the principles of international law, respecting the sovereignty of other nations, and avoiding any kind of aggression. This would lay the groundwork for constructive and effective collaboration between NATO and Russia, which could extend to various areas of mutual interest including peacekeeping operations, humanitarian efforts, and crisis management. Apart from addressing bilateral concerns, a mature relationship between NATO and Russia is essential for global peace and security. With the unpredictable nature of current geopolitical dynamics, any escalation of tensions between the two entities could have unforeseen consequences, leading to a renewed arms race, proxy wars, and heightened destabilization. In the long term, fostering a stable and constructive relationship between NATO and Russia could pave the way for arms control agreements, cooperative military exercises, and joint initiatives that enhance global security. In conclusion, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's call for a mature relationship with Russia should be considered as an opportunity for both parties to take a step back, reassess their priorities, and work together in the interest of regional and global stability. Pursuing a mutually beneficial relationship would not only alleviate security concerns of both sides but also contribute to easing tensions on the world stage. It is high time that the two entities embrace the spirit of cooperation and leave the animosities of the past behind in order to build a prosperous and secure future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the word \\"beachhead\\" mean the same thing in \\"The Germans were desperately trying to contain the Anzio beachhead.\\" and \\"The town became a beachhead in the campaign to ban smoking outdoors.\\"? Choose from:  +different meanings.  +the same meaning.","output":"The word \\"beachhead\\" in both sentences does not have the exact same meaning, but they share a similar concept. So, the answer would be: +different meanings. In the first sentence, \\"The Germans were desperately trying to contain the Anzio beachhead,\\" the term \\"beachhead\\" is used in its traditional military sense. In a military context, a beachhead refers to a strategically important area, usually on a shoreline, that an invading force has successfully captured and is now using as a secure starting point to continue advancing into enemy territory. In this instance, Anzio is the location where the invading forces landed and established their foothold during World War II. It represents a more literal interpretation of the term. In contrast, the second sentence, \\"The town became a beachhead in the campaign to ban smoking outdoors,\\" employs \\"beachhead\\" in a more metaphorical sense. While it still implies an initial foothold, it does not refer to a physical location or military operation. Instead, the term is used to describe the starting point of a broader effort or campaign, in this case, the campaign to ban smoking outdoors. The town serves as an example for other areas to potentially follow suit and join the movement. This usage of \\"beachhead\\" is more abstract, leveraging the military concept to describe the advancement of an idea or initiative. In summary, although the word \\"beachhead\\" is used in different contexts in these two sentences, the essence of the term remains the same: it signifies a foothold, whether literal or metaphorical, from which further progress can be made."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Water Pollution and Man Water pollution affects man's health, recreational use of water and sense of beauty. The spread of water-carried disease is of great concern. In highly developed countries in particular, emphasis has changed from concern over bacterial disease to concern over water-carried viral  disease. Viral hepatitis , for example, has been found to occur more frequently in cities whose water supplies have comparatively high levels of water impurity. Poisonous chemicals found in streams that are ultimately used for water supplies also create an important public health problem. It is clear that poisonous chemicals must be excluded from water, but more and more chemicals from new pesticides , fertilizers, and other new products have been found in water. Since the public health importance of these chemicals is not yet fully known, they are of increasing concern. The chemicals from fertilizers are also finding their way into water supplies from pollution. As man's desire for water-based recreation increases, greater demands are placed on the quality of the water. The water must not only but be attractive in appearance but also meet certain other conditions.  Sports such as swimming involve direct contact with water, and so water standards are raised higher. The range of water quality necessary for industrial processes varies greatly with the intended use of the water. The water used in steel mills, foe example, must have a lower chloride level than that accepted for drinking water. Cooling water can often be of comparatively low sanitary quality. A large part of the water used in the paper-making industry an be of  ly low quality in some aspects, but must contain little iron and carbon dioxide.

The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Clarence White (born Clarence Joseph LeBlanc; June 7, 1944 - July 14, 1973), was an American bluegrass and country guitarist and singer. He is best known as a member of the bluegrass ensemble the Kentucky Colonels and the rock band the Byrds, as well as for being a pioneer of the musical genre of country rock during the late 1960s. White also worked extensively as a session musician, appearing on recordings by the Everly Brothers, Joe Cocker, Ricky Nelson, Pat Boone, the Monkees, Randy Newman, Gene Clark, Linda Ronstadt, Arlo Guthrie, and Jackson Browne amongst others. Together with frequent collaborator Gene Parsons, he invented the B-Bender, a guitar accessory that enables a player to mechanically bend the B-string up a whole tone and emulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar. Context: During 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards rock 'n' roll as an avenue for artistic expression. Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like Doc Watson, Don Reno and Joe Maphis, he also idolized the playing of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, rock 'n' roller Chuck Berry, and studio musician James Burton. White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" with electric instruments. However, despite White's enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment's validity and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson's proteges, the Byrds.  By the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well-known guitarist. Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his Martin D-28 acoustic guitar to an electric Fender Telecaster, with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton. Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from open chording to fretting the whole guitar neck with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls. However, he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and, between 1965 and 1968, he undertook session work for artists including Ricky Nelson, the Monkees, and the Gosdin Brothers.  As 1965 turned into 1966, White met Gene Parsons and Gib Guilbeau at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and shortly after, he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs, as well as doing regular session work on their records, which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Gene. 1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio, which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel, Roger Bush, on bass. In autumn of that year, as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau, Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers, White was asked to provide lead guitar to ex-Byrd Gene Clark's debut solo album, Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers. White also briefly joined Clark's touring band shortly thereafter.  During the Clark album sessions, White reconnected with mandolin player and bassist Chris Hillman, who he had known during the early 1960s as a member of the bluegrass combo the Hillmen. Hillman was currently a member of the Byrds and in December 1966, he invited White to contribute countrified lead guitar playing to his songs \\"Time Between\\" and \\"The Girl with no Name\\", which both appeared on the Byrds' Younger Than Yesterday album. The country-oriented nature of the songs was something of a stylistic departure for the group and can be seen as an early indicator of the experimentation with country music that would color the Byrds' subsequent work. White also contributed guitar to the band's follow-up album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, and to their seminal 1968 country rock release, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. Question: Any other songs during this time? Answer:","output":"Yes, during this time, Clarence White also played on many other songs for various artists. Some of these songs include those by artists like the Everly Brothers, Joe Cocker, Pat Boone, Randy Newman, Linda Ronstadt, Arlo Guthrie, and Jackson Browne. Other than these, he contributed to more songs by the Byrds and Gene Clark. Clarence White was a very busy and talented guitarist who played on many different songs during his career, helping to create beautiful music for people to enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making 40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), Len Barry's \\"1-2-3\\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \\"The Wanderer\\" (1961) and \\"Runaround Sue\\" (1961). In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million (40 million). Jackson submitted a bid of 46 million on November 20, 1984.

First, we simplify the equation. We can combine the constants 139 and -3 to simplify it into: -17d + 136 = 0 Next, we move the 136 to the other side of the equation to isolate the term involving 'd'. We do this by subtracting 136 from both sides: -17d = -136  Finally, we need to solve for 'd'. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -17: d = -136 / -17 To get the solution, we perform the arithmetic: d = 8. So, the solution to the equation -17d + 139 - 3 = 0 is d = 8."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Lava from the Volcano A:","output":"Title: Lava's Grasp Genre: Action-Adventure/Sci-Fi/Drama Plot Summary: \\"Lava's Grasp\\" follows the thrilling and emotional journey of a group of primatologists and their team of highly intelligent gorillas who must work together to survive and save their home when a seemingly dormant volcano begins to erupt. As the lava engulfs the dense landscape, tensions rise and the stakes are higher than ever, blurring the lines between nature and intellect. The team must learn to adapt and evolve in order to face the ultimate challenge - the wrath of nature. Act 1: The Calm Before the Storm The movie starts with Dr. Amelia James, a dedicated primatologist, and her team of researchers studying a group of gorillas residing in the valley near the base of Mount Gira, a long-dormant volcano. The team has spent years living amongst the gorillas, building trust, and conducting groundbreaking research into their advanced communication and social structure. Their star gorilla, Koba, is especially intelligent and has formed a close bond with Dr. James, occasionally assisting in their research. Act 2: Deadly Awakening As Dr. James and her team continue their research, a series of unusual tremors and earthquakes shake the area. As tensions rise, they consult with experts who reveal that Mount Gira is showing signs of awakening. The team urgently decides to evacuate, but before they can leave, the volcano erupts, spewing lava and ash, blocking off any escape routes and separating the humans and gorillas. Act 3: Journey to Survival Stranded and facing imminent danger, Dr. James devises a plan to reunite with the gorillas and lead them to safety. But time is running out as the lava flow threatens to engulf the entire valley. The team must rely on their extensive knowledge of the terrain and Koba's keen survival skills to navigate the treacherous environment and avoid the deadly grasp of the lava. As they embark on their perilous journey, the team and the gorillas form an even stronger bond, showcasing the importance of trust and inter-species cooperation, as they face life-threatening obstacles and unforeseen challenges. Along the way, several gorillas, tragically succumb to the destructive force of the lava, making their mission even more urgent. Act 4: The Final Stand As lava continues to relentlessly flow towards the valley, the team and the gorillas find themselves cornered, with only a narrow and dangerous path to safety. In a desperate attempt to save the remaining gorillas, Dr. James and her team must lead them across the hazardous terrain and confront the impending wall of volcanic fury. In an emotional and heart-wrenching scene, Koba sacrifices himself to save a young gorilla from plunging into the deadly lava, showcasing the depth of his empathy and intelligence. United by their shared loss, the humans and gorillas press onward and finally reach a safe zone, just as the volcano reaches its peak eruption, obliterating their former home. Act 5: A New Beginning Dealing with the aftermath of the disaster, Dr. James and her team, along with the surviving gorillas, must work together to rebuild their lives and further develop the understanding of human and animal kinship. The sacrifices made and the bonds forged during their incredible journey serve as a testament to the power of unity in the face of adversity. The movie ends on a hopeful note, with the surviving gorilla group flourishing in their new environment, signifying that life can persist and rebuild despite the wrath of nature. \\"Lava's Grasp\\" is a visually stunning and emotionally charged film that explores the themes of resilience, unity, and the innate power of both human and animal.

Summarize this article: England's schools commissioner Sir David Carter told the Commons Education Committee 119 academies had been \\"re-brokered\\" as a last resort. Some academies were performing no better than the failing schools from which they had taken over, he told MPs. But he stressed the academies his team were most concerned about were being challenged and supported to improve. Sir David said of the 973 functioning multi-academy trusts in England, only seven had been inspected by Ofsted as part of a process known as \\"batched inspections\\". This is where a number of schools in an academy trust are inspected as a group because of concerns raised about performance. Following these seven batched inspections, Ofsted reported concerns about the outcomes for pupils and accused some of the trusts of sitting on large sums of cash that should have been spent on pupils. Sir David said: \\"There are academies that are performing not better or minimally better than the schools they were before. \\"The commitment these sponsors made was to improve these schools rapidly.\\" Of the academies that had been re-brokered since September 2014, 68 had gone from a multi-academy trust to another multi-academy trust and 51 and gone from a single academy trust to a multi-academy trust, he said. The \\"re-brokerage solution\\" was an important tool for regional schools commissioners challenging under-performance, he said, but it was also disruptive and expensive and affected the children at the school. On the whole, regional commissioners, who are charged with overseeing standards in the academy system, tried to get involved with struggling academies before they got so bad that there was no other option but to find another sponsor and new management, Sir David said. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, also giving evidence, said some multi-academy trusts had \\"been allowed to grow to far too quickly, without the capacity to improve their individual schools\\". He said: \\"There was a lot of empire building going on and executive head teachers who wanted to show how many schools they had rather than whether they were any good or not.\\" Sir David agreed that expansion had sometimes been too quick in the past, but suggested the situation had improved in recent years. Summary:","output":"England's schools commissioner, Sir David Carter, has told the Commons Education Committee that 119 academies have gone through the \\"re-brokerage solution\\" process as a last resort, admitting that some academies were performing no better than the failing schools they had originally taken over.

If food price um but mostly i think you know service and atmosphere are the two things that you know i don't minds paying little bit if if i don't have to wait too long to eat and if the service is good the food is good, can we conclude that \\"I refuse to pay anything extra for eating quickly because I should just be able to anyway.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot outright conclude that \\"I refuse to pay anything extra for eating quickly because I should just be able to anyway.\\" However, there are several factors to consider when examining this statement, which include the importance of food price, service, atmosphere, and the speed of eating. 1. Food price: It has been mentioned that you may not mind paying a little bit more for certain factors like better service, but it is not clear precisely where the threshold of acceptable pricing lies. While increased food costs may be worth it for improved service or a great atmosphere, the willingness to tolerate higher prices can vary from person to person. 2. Service: Undeniably, great service is an essential factor for many people in deciding where to dine. Prompt, friendly, and attentive service can significantly enhance the overall dining experience. While some may be willing to pay extra for exceptional service, others may expect a certain level of service to be a given, with no additional cost involved. 3. Atmosphere: The atmosphere of a restaurant can indeed influence the dining experience and dictate if customers feel comfortable and relaxed. A well-designed and inviting atmosphere can encourage diners to pay slightly higher prices for the overall experience. However, each individual can differ in their preferences and expectations regarding ambiance, so not everyone might agree with the idea of paying extra for it. 4. Speed of eating: Although it is acceptable to assume that most people would prefer not to wait too long for their meal, it is not entirely clear if this equates to refusing to pay extra. Some customers might consider paying more for quicker service if they are in a hurry, while others may still expect a reasonable wait time without incurring additional charges. The statement \\"I refuse to pay anything extra for eating quickly because I should just be able to anyway\\" can be a personal opinion, but it is not a universally applicable conclusion. Several factors contribute to the dining experience, and individual preferences play a significant role in deciding whether one is willing to pay extra for a quicker meal or expects this to be a baseline service quality."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

[+] yes; [+] it is not possible to tell; [+] no;","output":"It is not possible to tell if \\"I asked if this was her favorite job\\" can be concluded from \\"I asked her if she enjoyed her job.\\" Although both questions are related to her feelings towards her job, they are not necessarily synonymous. Asking if someone enjoys their job refers to whether they find their current position satisfying, engaging, and fulfilling. It seeks to understand if they are content with the work they do, its challenges, environment, and how it aligns with their goals or values. On the other hand, asking if it is someone's favorite job might require a comparison with previous or other jobs held by the individual. It seeks to understand the personal ranking of their current job compared to other work experiences they have had. Their favorite job may be the one they find most enjoyable and satisfying, surpassing other jobs they have held in the past. Thus, while it is true that someone who describes their current job as their favorite may also enjoy it, the reverse is not necessarily true. Someone might enjoy their present job but have enjoyed a previous or another job even more.

Chungaung Piao, 27, of Allenby Gardens in Adelaide's west, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Monday after being arrested on Saturday. He is charged with murdering sex worker Ting Fang, 25, whose body was found in a room at the Grand Chancellor Hotel in the city centre. Scroll down for video. Ting Fang, 25, was found murdered in an Adelaide city hotel room with a slashed neck on New Year's Day. Chungaung Piao, 27, of Allenby Gardens, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court two days after he was arrested. He has been charged with Fang's murder. Ms Fang was found deceased in the hotel room with her neck slashed open. The court heard that, 'there was an extremely serious injury to (Ms Fang's) neck, both her (internal and external) jugular veins were cut,' she said. Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's understood she was working as a sex worker. Prosecutor Lucy Boord alleged that Piao's fingerprint was found on the victim's shoe, according to the Adelaide Advertiser. Defence lawyer Julian Kelly said Piao denied involvement in the murder. Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's understood she was working as a sex worker. Ms Fang was found deceased in the Hotel Grand Chancellor Hotel when the hallway and the level below her twelfth-floor apartment began to flood. A tap was running in the room where she'd been killed. Ms Fang was found murdered in her twelfth-floor hotel room in Adelaide's city. 'My client voluntarily attended the police station on Saturday night... the fingerprint as I understand was found on a shoe, which is not inconsistent with his version of events to police,' Mr Kelly said. The court heard that Piao is married with an eight-month-old son. He is a Chinese national and has been living in Australia for four years on a bridging visa. For this reason, the magistrate Luke Davis ruled that Piao is a flight risk and he was refused bail, according to the Advertiser. The 27-year-old was seeking release on home detention bail so he could return to his family. Piao was remanded in custody until January 19 when he will formally apply for bail. The man who has been charged with her murder, Chungaung Piao, is a 27-year-old father-of-one who is from Allenby Gardens in Adelaide's west.

Both of these attacks, attributed to the drug trafficking cartels, took place after 10 bombs, placed in nine political offices of the Liberal and Social Conservative parties and in another bank office, exploded early this morning in downtown Bogota. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Bogota is a very old country\\"?","output":"Based on the paragraph provided, we cannot conclude that \\"Bogota is a very old country.\\" In fact, there is a misconception in the statement itself: Bogota is not a country; it is the capital city of Colombia, a country located in South America. The paragraph discusses attacks in Bogota attributed to drug trafficking cartels. Moreover, it informs the reader about bombings that took place in the offices of various political parties and a bank office. While this information grants insight into the political violence and conflict occurring in Bogota at that time, it does not provide any details about the city's age or history. To understand Bogota's history and whether it could be considered \\"very old,\\" one must delve into the origins of the city. Bogota was founded on August 6, 1538, by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. Its original name was \\"Bacatá\\" in the indigenous Muisca language, referring to the powerful zipa or king who ruled in this region. Bogota then became an important hub for trade and administration during the Spanish colonial period. While over 480 years of history can be considered \\"old,\\" it's important to note this age is specific to the city rather than the country. Furthermore, age perception is subjective; what is considered old in one context could be seen as relatively young in another, especially when compared to ancient civilizations with histories spanning thousands of years. Thus, while Bogota possesses a rich historical background, it may not be accurate to label it as a \\"very old country,\\" especially since it is not a country but rather the capital city of Colombia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \\"featured with\\" Queen as \\"Queen + Paul Rodgers\\", not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating. In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist.  Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. The band's drummer Roger Taylor commented; \\"We never thought we would tour again, Paul [Rodgers] came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie.\\" The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006. The Foo Fighters paid homage to the band in performing \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Paul Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits.  On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \\"secret location\\". Queen + Paul Rodgers performed at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute held in Hyde Park, London on 27 June 2008, to commemorate Mandela's ninetieth birthday, and again promote awareness of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The first Queen + Paul Rodgers album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the release of the album, the band again went on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The Kharkiv concert was later released on DVD. The tour then moved to Russia, and the band performed two sold-out shows at the Moscow Arena. Having completed the first leg of its extensive European tour, which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries, the UK leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three London dates, the first of which was The O2 on 13 October. The last leg of the tour took place in South America, and included a sold-out concert at the Estadio Jose Amalfitani, Buenos Aires.  Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009. Rodgers stated: \\"My arrangement with [Queen] was similar to my arrangement with Jimmy [Page] in The Firm in that it was never meant to be a permanent arrangement\\". Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working with Queen again.","output":"This text is about the British rock band, Queen, and their various line-ups and collaborations over the years, including the period when they teamed up with Paul Rodgers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The band, formed in 1969, featured singer Tony Burrows as its main vocalist. This hit single, released in 1970, was written by the successful British songwriting duo, Barry Mason and Tony Macaulay. The song quickly achieved commercial success, reaching the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart and peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. It became Edison Lighthouse's signature song, as well as their biggest hit. The catchy tune and memorable chorus have made this song a classic of its time. Although Tony Burrows played a pivotal role in the success of \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes),\\" he would not remain part of Edison Lighthouse for long. After a brief period, Burrows would depart the band to focus on his other musical projects, such as The Pipkins, First Class, and Brotherhood of Man. Nonetheless, Edison Lighthouse continued to make music without him, albeit with limited success compared to their early chart-topping hit. In summary, \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\" is a much-loved track sung by Tony Burrows of Edison Lighthouse, with songwriting credits going to Barry Mason and Tony Macaulay. Despite various lineup changes and the departure of the lead vocalist, the song has remained a timeless classic that continues to be enjoyed by fans of 1970s pop music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Moreover, the reviewer explicitly presents their disapproval of putting words to \\"Deborah's Theme\\" from Once Upon A Time in America, referring to this action as a \\"crime.\\" The title of the review itself is a strong indication of the negative feedback – \\"Absolutely Awful.\\" This emphasizes the reviewer's complete dissatisfaction with the product.

Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque, menacing, swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so. He learns too late how empty his hustling, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny. In spite of his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other, the result being hilarious and touchingly sad. The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he frantically reaches for it as if he's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte wasn't allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith), so he never got his wings. The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostel's grasp, a metaphor for both men's live: it's too late and you don't get a second chance.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans.

Politics The CNBC Republican Debate Was A Total Trainwreck CREDIT: AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill John Kasich, left, and Donald Trump, second from right, argue across fellow candidates during the CNBC Republican presidential debate at the University of Colorado, Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2015, in Boulder, Colo.      Reporters from both conservative and liberal-minded news organizations seem to agree: the CNBC Republican presidential debate was kind of a trainwreck.      That wasn’t really because of the candidates, though — it was because of the moderators. For the first hour, CNBC moderators Becky Quick, John Harwood, and Carl Quintanilla didn’t let candidates interact with each other, resulting in multiple moments of incomprehensible yelling. This may have been because of stricter time limits — this particular 10-candidate debate was only two hours, while the previous Republican debates have spanned three hours.      But constant interruption wasn’t the only problem. Candidates were also highly critical of the CNBC crew, accusing them of being part of the “liberal media.” At one point, Ted Cruz ripped into the moderators for asking what he called unfair and non-substantive questions. And in two instances, audience members actually booed at questions the moderators asked of Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee.      There was even a moment when moderator Becky Quick admitted she was unsure of Donald Trump’s position on high-skill immigrant visas after questioning him about it. She first asserted that Trump was critical of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg, who wanted to increase H-1B visas for highly skilled immigrants. This is true — Trump has been critical of Zuckerburg for that reason. But when Trump said he hadn’t been, and Quick admitted she was confused.      “Where did I come up with this?” she asked, “That you were..?”      Trump interrupted: “I don’t know. You people write this stuff.”      Quick then apologized to Trump for ostensibly misquoting him — she accused Trump of calling Marco Rubio “Mark Zuckerburg’s personal senator,” and Trump said he “never said that.” But Trump did say that — the statement is literally on his campaign site.      Watch:      The debacle garnered a lot of Twitter angst from journalists:            These moderators are CRASHING and burning. Holy crap. I have never seen anything this bad. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) October 29, 2015            Even liberal reporters in the press room are groaning about how terrible these CNBC moderators are. — Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) October 29, 2015            These moderators are just the worst. #GOPDebate — Lisa Friedman (@LFFriedman) October 29, 2015 ||||| Donald Trump and Ben Carson may have stood at the center of the stage at Wednesday's debate, but Marco Rubio stole the show.      It was a sharp contrast from the first two contests, when Trump dominated the discussion. On Wednesday, the braggy billionaire reverted to almost just another candidate on the stage, not even involved in one of the debate’s defining moments.      Story Continued Below      That came when Jeb Bush, in need of a jolt after money woes forced him to slash his campaign payroll in the last week, attacked Rubio, his onetime Florida ally, for his Senate attendance record.      Bush lectured Rubio that if he wanted to continue skipping votes he should “just resign and let someone else take the job.”      “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term,” Bush said. “And you should be showing up to work.”      Rubio was ready, dismissing Bush as a political opportunist turning on an old friend. “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” he said.      It was the end of discussion. The mentor had gone after the protégé but came away bruised.      While that exchange got the audience going, many of the candidates scored ovations by attacking the moderators and, more broadly, the mainstream media.      “This is not a cage match,” said Ted Cruz, blasting the CNBC moderators' questions for almost every candidate in the field. “How about talking about the substantive issues people care about?”      As the crowd roared in approval, Cruz didn’t let up. “Nobody watching at home believes that any of the moderators have any intention of voting in a Republican primary,” he added.      Facebook and Twitter said Cruz’s media assault was the most talked-about moment of the debate on their influential platforms. And focus-group guru Frank Luntz gushed on Twitter that, “Ted Cruz's focus group dials hits 98 with his attack on media bias. That's the highest score we've ever measured. EVER.”      Rubio also scored big with his media slam. When Rubio declared that, “Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It’s called the mainstream media,” it was the second-most tweeted moment of the debate.      Carson, meanwhile, delivered another low-key performance, dispassionately refuting critical questions about his flat-tax plan and his business relationship with supplement company Mannatech. But if his past unheralded performances are any indicator, it won’t likely hurt him at the polls. Carson has soared, especially in Iowa, even recently eclipsing Trump in some surveys.      With Trump as headliner, the 2016 debates have become must-see TV and, as a result, taken on outsize importance in the contest. That is bad news for Bush who, on Wednesday, spoke the least of any candidate on stage just as most political analysts believed he needed a lift. Off stage, Danny Diaz, Bush’s campaign manager, could be seen in a heated conversation with a CNBC producer.      Rubio didn’t just shine in his showdown with Bush.      He turned around a tough question on how he’d managed his personal finances, including cashing out a retirement account early and paying thousands in fees, despite earning a six-figure Senate salary and writing a best-selling book. Rubio dismissed the inquiries as “a series of discredited attacks,” though they were accurate, pivoting smoothly to his family narrative as the son of a bartender and maid.      And Rubio earned laughs when he said he had to explain to his wife why “someone named Sallie-Mae was taking 1,000” every month to pay down his student loans. When CNBC’s Becky Quick tried to follow up that some of his questionable financial decisions came after Rubio had earned large sums from his book, Rubio quipped back, “And it's available on paperback, if you're interested.”      Rubio’s campaign was soliciting their email list for money even before the debate was over. “Marco is winning,” one email read. “If you’re not watching, get in front of a TV or computer — a radio, even — ASAP.”      It was a different story for Trump, who shrank on stage after a combative start in which he challenged the CNBC moderators about the tone and substance of their questions. He began the event on his heels when the opening question from John Harwood was about whether his big promises amounted to running a “comic-book” campaign for president.      “Not a very nicely asked question, the way you said that,” Trump replied.      Trump insisted he would build a 1,000-mile wall on the border with Mexico, and make Mexico pay for it. “We can do a wall. We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall” for legal immigrants,” Trump said.      Harwood followed up, saying he had talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties about Trump's tax plan: \\"They say you have as much chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your wings.\\"      Trump exploded. \\"Then you would have to get rid of Larry Kudlow … who came out the other day and said 'I love Trump’s tax plan.”      Ohio Gov. John Kasich was one of the few candidates to cast himself as the adult in the debate from the opening seconds, when he said he worried that the Republican Party was “on the verge perhaps of picking someone who cannot do this job.”      \\"Folks, we've got to wake up,\\" Kasich said. He also mocked Carson's tax plan and said his health plan amounted to \\"getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.\\"      \\"We cannot elect somebody who doesn’t know how to do the job,\\" Kasich said.      Trump struck right back at Kasich on the Ohio economy. “John got lucky with a thing called fracking,” Trump said, adding that Kasich once worked for Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street bank that failed in the 2008 financial crisis. And he dismissed Kasich as desperately launching attacks on him.      “His poll numbers tanked,” Trump said.      Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina used some of her familiar and well-received lines against Clinton but did not star as she did in September, when she surged in the polls following the debate, before dropping back into the middle of the pack. She did defend her corporate record, including 30,000 layoffs under her watch, as tackling “entrenched problems head-on.”      \\"I cut bureaucracy down to size, reintroduced accountability focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market and every product segment,\\" she said. \\"And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs, we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business.”      Chris Christie, who along with Kasich, Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee is on the bubble to make the next debate, delivered a confident performance, pleasing the audience with his barbs against two popular targets: Democrats and the media.      Of the Democratic field, Christie said, “I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.” He added of Clinton, “You put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.”      And Christie mocked a question about fantasy football gambling as a needless media aside. “We’re talking about fantasy football?” he asked incredulously. “Enough on fantasy football. Let people play. Who cares.” Huckabee piled on the media, too: “This is just a great big game and we’re just the players.”      Cruz delivered perhaps the oddest pitch of the night, selling himself as America’s designated driver. “If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy,” he said. “But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.”      Whatever momentum comes from the CNBC bout, it could be short lived. The next debate, in Wisconsin, is already less than two weeks away. ||||| Photo by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images      Marco Rubio was strong but not quite spectacular during the first two Republican debates, picking up some fans but largely failing to stand out on a stage dominated by Donald Trump. On Wednesday, though, the freshman senator finally lived up to his billing as the candidate who could sell his party’s more conventional views to its anti-establishment base.      Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.      Rubio was polished and poised in Colorado, delivering a superior performance that included well-timed one-liners and powerful counterattacks. As important for Rubio, though, was that his biggest rival in the establishment lane—Jeb Bush—failed to turn in the type of performance that would soothe the fears of his nervous-and-getting-more-so backers inside the Republican Party.      Advertisement            It was clear early that Rubio came ready to fight. When CNBC’s John Harwood pressed him to respond to a newspaper in his home state, the Sun-Sentinel, calling on him to resign his Senate seat while he seeks the presidency over his history of missed votes, Rubio ticked off the percentage of votes Barack Obama and John Kerry missed when they were running for president and called media bias. “This is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservatives,” Rubio shot back. The partisan crowd went wild.      Rubio was even better when Bush tried to pile on—a decision he’ll probably regret if he rewatches the tape. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s voting record,” Rubio said in a reference to Bush’s recent adoption of the 2008 nominee as his spirit animal. “The only reason you're doing it now is because we’re running for the same position,” Rubio told his former mentor. “Someone convinced you attacking me is going to help you.”      Later, when CNBC’s Becky Quick pressed Rubio about whether his past personal bookkeeping problems suggest he doesn’t have the “maturity and wisdom” to be president, Rubio played the “think-of-the-children” card to great affect. “My four children received a good Christian education and I’ve been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did,” he said. “I’m not worried about my finances, I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans who struggle in the economy that is not making good jobs.” When the moderator continued to press, Rubio spun it into an attack on the Democratic front-runner. “I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children and how expensive it is for working families,” he said. “We can’t afford another four years of that. Which is what we will get if we elect a big-government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.” It was somewhere between a nonanswer and a non sequitur, but it landed in the room.      MSM attack? Check. Hillary attack? Check. The only question left was whether Rubio could combine the two. Before the night was over, though, he’d done one better by finding a way to check off Benghazi from his hit list. “The mainstream media is saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign,” he said. “It was the week she got exposed as a liar. But she has her super PAC helping her out: the American mainstream media.”      While Rubio was shining, Jeb was stumbling. His suggestion that fantasy football be “looked at in terms of regulation” was overshadowed by his decision to get way too specific about his own fantasy football team, boasting about his record (7-0) and his starting QB (Ryan Tannehill). Christie mocked the very premise of the question, making Bush’s answer look even smaller: “Wait a second, we have 19 trillion in debt, people out of work, ISIS and Al Qaeda attacking us and we’re talking about fantasy football? Can we stop?” Earlier while talking about budget compromises, Bush had gone for laughs and missed badly: “The deal is gone, you find a Democrat that is for cutting spending 10 dollars, I’ll give them a warm kiss.” ||||| Tweets from https://twitter.com/politico/lists/debate-night-w-politico The 2016 Blast The latest POLITICO scoops and coverage of the 2016 elections.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)      Republican presidential candidates sparred over experience, took jabs at their Democratic opponents and even shared a few laughs during CNBC's main debate in Boulder, Colo., on Oct. 28. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)      The third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday evening ended with a handful of winners – Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz – and one clear loser, former Florida governor Jeb Bush.      Bush, who was the well-financed front-runner at the beginning of the year, had one good moment in the beginning of the debate, when he attacked Rubio for his record of absences in the Senate. But that moment quickly became a devastating one for Bush, as Rubio responded with a faux-friendly cutdown: “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” he told Bush. “It’s not.”      After that, Bush was a minor presence – a night so bad for him that his campaign manager confronted CNBC producers off the stage, angry about Bush’s lack of airtime.      Rubio, by contrast, used the debate to cast himself as someone who understood middle-class concerns about student debt and income. By taking down Bush, he blunted an entire line of questioning about his withdrawal from the daily work of the Senate.      [Full coverage: Republican presidential debate]      During the third GOP debate, candidates got feisty with the CNBC moderators. They took aim at the questions asked, at the \\"mainstream media\\" and at the moderators interrupting their answers. (Victoria M. Walker/The Washington Post)      Cruz and Christie also had strong moments while criticizing the moderators: Cruz attacked their questions as too negative, and Christie criticized them for asking about whether government should regulate the lucrative ‘daily fantasy” sports business. Christie mocked the moderators for focusing on “fantasy football” with so many other problems in the country.      It was certainly not a good night for the moderators, who were booed on at least two occasions for questions the audience thought were unfair.      One of the strongest moments for Donald Trump, the billionaire front-runner, came at the very end of the debate, when he said he had teamed up with neurosurgeon Ben Carson to force CNBC to shorten the debate. There, Trump said, was proof of his basic campaign promise: nobody was better than him at getting a good deal. Moderator John Harwood denied Trump’s assertion.      Earlier, Trump denounced gun-free zones in public places as “target practice for the sickos,” underlining his pro-gun credentials during the third main GOP presidential debate.      “That’s target practice for the sickos, and the mentally ill. That’s targets. They look around for gun free zones,” Trump said, talking about recent shootings at schools and military installations. “I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. They are feeding frenzy for sick people.”      Trump had been uncharacteristically quiet during the first hour and a half of the debate. But he used this moment to talk about his experience with guns, including his permits to carry weapons in New York City. “I like to be unpredictable,” about when he actually carries a gun, Trump said. “Unlike our country, by the way, which is totally predictable.”      The next question was to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who was asked – as a minister – if Trump had the moral authority to be president. Some in the crowd booed. Huckabee rejected the question: “The last [thing] I need is to give him some more time,” Huckabee said.      1 of 18 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The top quotes from the third Republican presidential debate View Photos Memorable quotes from the third GOP debate.

Christie interjected himself into a discussion about whether the government should regulate the huge, high-earning “daily fantasy” sites that let people win huge amounts of money through the success of sports players. Bush, who got the question, seemed to indicate it should be treated as gambling, and regulated.      Christie jumped in, apparently incredulous that the question was even being asked: Why would the government, with all of its problems, bother with something like this?      “Enough on fantasy football! Let people play! Who cares?” he said. Later, Christie continued in his confrontational mood, stopping after Harwood had talked over him.      “Do you want me to answer, or do you want to answer? Even in New Jersey, what you’re doing is called rude,” Christie said.      Earlier, Rubio called Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton a liar, and said that the mainstream media had worked to cover up Clinton’s falsehoods about the attacks that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.      “You know, the Democrats have the ultimate Super PAC, it’s called the mainstream media,” Rubio said. He mentioned an 11-hour hearing about Benghazi on Capitol Hill last week, in which Republicans grilled Clinton about her conduct as secretary of state at the time of the attacks. “It was the week she got exposed as a liar. But she has her Super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.”      That comment came on a night when the media – and CNBC itself – became a punching bag for the GOP candidates.      An exchange between a CNBC moderator and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson – which began with questions about Carson’s ties to a nutritional-supplement company – ended with the crowd booing the moderator himself.      The boos seemed to indicate that the crowd believed Carson when he said he had no real relationship with the company, Mannatech, which news reports have said has a history of legal actions and accusations of false claims. When moderator Carl Quintanilla pressed Carson to say if he had made an error in judgment, the crowd itself booed. “See, they know,” Carson said.      Rubio used a sharp comeback to defuse Bush’s attack on his voting record in the Senate, and turned a question about his personal financial struggles into a chance to empathize with voters’ own money worries.      “I didn’t inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid…I know what it’s like to owe that money,” Rubio said, after a moderator asked about his personal debts, including student loans. “I’m not worried about my finances. I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans.”      Rubio defended his record of missed votes in the Senate in the third GOP presidential debate, saying he was rebelling against a GOP establishment that wanted to keep him out of the presidential race.      “That’s exactly what the Republican establishment says too, wait in line. Wait for what?,” he said when asked by a moderator why he was in such a rush to leave his work in the Senate. Rubio, making an argument he’s made several times in recent weeks, said his ambitions for American could not wait on the slow-moving Senate. “The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now.”      That brought an attack from Bush – a onetime ally of Rubio’s, now a bitter rival as they battle for the establishment’s support in this race. Bush, a Florida resident, cast himself as a wronged constituent of Rubio’s.      “I expected that he would do constituent service, which means he shows up to work,” Bush said. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this is a six year term, and you should be showing up to work…Or just resign, and let somebody else take the job.”      Rubio clearly had been expecting this attack, and responded with a sharp attack on Bush – followed by a pledge that he would not attack people, as Bush just had.      “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you….It’s not,” Rubio said. “I’m not running against Gov. Bush. I’m not running against anyone else on the stage. I’m running for president.”      Cruz attacked the moderators, for asking too-hard questions of the other candidates. “The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than any participant in the Democratic debate,” Cruz said.      In that attack, Cruz used up the time he’d been allotted to answer a question about the debt ceiling, and why Cruz opposed a bill to raise it.      When that was pointed out, Cruz offered to answer the question. When moderators didn’t let him, he seemed outraged. “You’re not interested in an answer? You’re not interested in an answer?”      Earlier, Carson, a new front-runner in the Republican race, faced strong criticism of his tithing-based tax plan, when Kasich called Carson’s plan “fantasy.”      “You can’t do it with empty promises. You know, these plans would put us trillions of dollars in debt,” Kasich said. “We cannot elect somebody that doesn’t know how to do the job.”      Even at the moment when Kasich was attacking his rival, Carson, Trump – unable to let a chance to insult pass by -- intervened to attack Kasich for his low poll numbers. “That’s why he’s on the end,” Trump said.      A few minutes earlier, the third Republican presidential debate had begun like an awkward job interview, with a moderator asking candidates to name their biggest weakness. The result, as in most job interviews, was a group of people who didn’t actually answer the question.      “Good question,” said Kasich, who then ignored the question to insult his colleagues. “We’re on the verge of picking somebody who could perhaps not do this job.”      “If I have a weakness, it’s that I try to play by the rules,” said Huckabee.      “I share an optimism” about the country’s future,” said Rubio.      “I’m a fighter,” said Cruz.      The closest thing to a weakness that anyone admitted came from an unlikely source: Trump. “I’m too trusting,” Trump said. “And if they let me down, when they let me down, I never forgive.”      Earlier on Wednesday, four low-performing Republican candidates faced off in another dinnertime “undercard” debate. The dominant figures in that debate were Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), the jokester; Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the hard-right conservative; and a large and growing cast of CNBC moderators, who at times seemed loathe to let the actual candidates speak.      Graham – showing his trademark combination of humor and deadly seriousness – closed out the earlier debate by mocking Donald Trump, and then swinging to an emotional plea that American make him commander in chief.      Graham (S.C.) joked that he’d heard – or maybe read it on a hat – that somebody wanted to “Make America Great Again.” That was a jab at Trump, who had made the slogan -- and the hats that bear it -- famous this year. Then Graham turned to his own message.      “America is great. I intend to make America strong again,” he said, pledging to help the middle class, and to back American troops, even as he sent them into a new land war in Syria.      “They have had our back. God knows, they have had our back. And I intend to have their back…Make me commander in chief.”      [Transcript: CNBC undercard GOP debate]      Jindal, formerly known as a wonk-Republican, made an appeal to pugnacious hard-core conservatives and Christian right. In the course of the debate, Jindal derided Democrats as socialists, and Republicans in Washington as weak and too quick to surrender.      Jindal ended the first debate with an appeal for Americans to think of their country in Christian terms: with faith that a frightening situation could be saved.      “The idea of America is slipping away. As Christians, we believe that the tomb is empty. As Americans we believe that our best days are ahead of us,” Jindal said, meaning the tomb of Jesus Christ, which Christians believe was found empty because Christ had been resurrected after death. “We can save the idea of America,” Jindal said. “Before it’s too late.”      Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum sought to play the role of a business-focused realist: asked about the Export-Import Bank, a conservative bogeyman, Santorum defended the institution as a crucial aid to U.S. manufacturing. Without it, he said, other countries would use similar state-sponsored institutions to give their own industries a leg up over American firms. “In order to have a level playing field which is what conservatives talk about all the time, then we have to have export financing,” Santorum said.      At one point, Graham launched into a diatribe about the state of the Republican Party, complaining that other candidates were making unrealistic promises – and that the GOP nominee might lose to a weak Democrat in 2016.      “At the end of the day folks, I am trying to solve a problem and win an election. I am tired of losing!” Graham shouted, as moderators tried to quiet him. He complained that the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had made misleading claims that she’d been flat broke” after leaving the White House, and about Sen. Bernie Sanders’s long ties to socialism. “The number two guy [in the Democratic race] went to the Soviet Union and I don’t think he came back. If we can’t beat these people, then who in the hell are we going to beat!”      Graham’s speech may have been the emotional high point of a rather sleepy undercard, in which four long shots debated soberly about their tax plans. Jindal had touted his plan to make poor people a 2 percent federal income tax, a change from the present system where 45 percent of Americans pay no federal income tax. Former New York governor George Pataki said his plan was better than Jindal’s tax plan because he had the political skills to get it passed.      At one point, Pataki talked over another candidate in order to condemn Washington politicians for…interrupting.      “In Washington, they talk over each other!” he said, while talking over Graham. “I’m not used to that. I listen when people talk.”      Jenna Johnson, in Sioux City, Iowa, and David Weigel, in Boulder, Colo., contributed to this report. ||||| Cruz was also in fine fettle, delivering strong answers. The Texan offered far more specific economic policies than any of his rivals, though some of those ideas were politically risky or economically suspect. Cruz recommended partially privatizing Social Security, an idea that was roundly rejected when President George W. Bush attempted it. He called for auditing the Federal Reserve—stealing thunder from Rand Paul, who stood elsewhere on stage—and for abolishing the IRS, replacing it with a postcard-sized tax return. Somewhat bizarrely, Cruz also appeared to call for a return to the gold standard.      But Cruz skipped a chance to deliver a specific answer about the budget deal under consideration in Congress right now—as did most of his fellow candidates. While the candidates discussed jobs and income inequality, their prescriptions tended toward the superficial: Get government out of the way, they said, and growth would follow. Perhaps the only policy that united most of the candidates was the need to protect existing federal entitlements for today’s seniors.      Carly Fiorina, who proved to be one of the strongest debaters in the last two meetings but has fallen off the map since the last debate, was comparatively subdued and didn’t dominate as she did before. She called for a three-page tax code (to the moderators’ incredulity), on populist grounds. She attacked Hillary Clinton, and yet again, she defended her record at HP, where she was fired by the board. Moderators seem to insist on asking this question over and over, even though her answer has remained consistent—that she was sacked in a political struggle and did what was needed to save the company.      Ben Carson was also, as usual, subdued—though so far it’s worked for him. Carson has been shaky when discussing policy, but he mostly managed to avoid potholes. However, when pressed by Becky Quick on the fact that his plan would create huge deficits, he insisted it wouldn’t, saying growth would replace it—the classic Laffer Curve argument. But his answer doesn’t conform with any serious analysis. Carson also parried a question about Mannatech, a questionable supplement company for which he cut ads, by saying it was a liberal attack and that he wasn’t really involved. That worked on stage, but it’s likely to bring new, unwelcome scrutiny to his relationship with Mannatech—a story that, by the way, was broken by the conservative National Review.      This wasn’t Donald Trump’s night: He remained silent for long stretches, and much of the time he spent didn’t make him look good. After he denied to Becky Quick that he’d criticized H1B visas, Quick came back after break and pointed out that she read the quote on Trump’s own website. (Whoops!) Early on, Trump attempted a return to his political roots—way back in June!—with a stirring rant about the need to secure the border, the issue that took him to the top of the polls. Yet just as he delivered a strong defense of progressive taxation at the last debate, Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat on campaign finance Wednesday night: “Super PACs are a disaster, they're a scam, they cause dishonesty, and we've got to get rid of them.” ||||| A:","output":"The CNBC Republican presidential debate, held yesterday in Boulder, Colorado, has been widely criticized for the performance of the moderators.

SEOUL, South Korea — On his first mission to reassure an important American ally, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met on Thursday with top South Korean officials, who agreed to push ahead with the deployment of a new missile defense system.      “Thaad is for defense of our allies’ people, of our troops who are committed to their defense,” Mr. Mattis told reporters, using the acronym for Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, the American antimissile system. It is meant to intercept North Korea’s medium-range missiles.      “Were it not for the provocative behavior of North Korea, we would have no need for Thaad out here,” Mr. Mattis added. “There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about Thaad.”      South Korea was a logical first stop for Mr. Mattis, who will also visit Japan on the trip. Tensions have risen in the region after Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, proclaimed during his New Year’s Day address that his military was preparing to conduct its first test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. ||||| (CNN) New US Defense Secretary James Mattis on Thursday defended the planned deployment of a missile defense system in South Korea, saying only North Korea had anything to fear from it.      After arriving at the Osan Air Base outside Seoul, Mattis said Pyongyang's \\"provocative behavior\\" was the only reason the US-developed system was on the agenda.      South Korea's decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, known as THAAD, has drawn sharp criticism from China, which sees it as part of a broader US strategy to extend its military alliance network from Japan all the way down to the South China Sea.      \\"There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about THAAD other than North Korea if they're engaged in something that's offensive,\\" Mattis said.      On Thursday afternoon, Mattis met with acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-ahn in Seoul and reiterated the strength of the US-South Korean alliance.      \\"I talked to President Trump and he wanted to make a very clear statement about the priority that we place on this alliance between our two nations,\\" the US defense chief said.      \\"Our new administration inherits a very strong, trusted relationship between our two countries, and it's our commitment to make it even stronger.\\"      Mattis' arrival in South Korea comes at a time of relative quiet from Kim Jong Un's regime , which hasn't tested a ballistic missile since October 20 after firing off projectiles at a record rate earlier in 2016.      The question North Korea watchers are asking: How long will Kim keep his missile program grounded?      Some analysts expect testing to resume soon.      \\"They have a wonderful tradition of greeting every new US president with a bit of fireworks, sometimes a nuclear test, sometimes ICBM launch, and they're not going to break this tradition,\\" Korean studies professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul told CNN.      But Bruce Bennett of the Rand Corp. think tank said Kim's testing hiatus is focused not on Washington, but on Seoul and the recent impeachment of President Park Geun-hye in a corruption scandal.      Her fate is now before South Korea's Constitutional Court. A decision against her could trigger elections earlier than the mandated December 20 deadline.      \\"I believe that North Korea's No. 1 objective between now and the ROK presidential election is to ensure that the new South Korean president will be a progressive and certainly not a conservative,\\" Bennett said, using the acronym for the Republic of Korea.      \\"But any provocations that it commits would give support to conservative candidates,\\" the senior defense analyst said.

After Kim said in a televised New Year's Day speech that his military is on the brink of testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile -- a rocket that can be equipped with nuclear weapons and is powerful enough to reach any part of the United States -- Trump vowed in a tweet, \\"It won't happen!\\"      North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017      But the incoming US leader didn't say how he'd block Kim's missile ambitions.      On the campaign trail last year, he said he might be willing to meet the North Korean leader for discussions over a hamburger.      Mattis said Thursday he's in South Korea to listen to its leaders before deciding on what strategy the Trump administration will adopt concerning Pyongyang.      \\"I need to get some data from them, I need to get their appreciation of the situation before I start making statements about where I stand,\\" Mattis said.

A lot of mainstream coverage of the issue, which has China and South Korea at loggerheads, correctly notes that China is worried about the system, but doesn’t quite get at what exactly THAAD is, what it does, and why its deployment on the Korean peninsula is so threatening to China. China’s anxiety over THAAD has gotten to the point where its ambassador to South Korea would suggest that its implementation would destroy their bilateral relationship in “an instant.”      THAAD is a relative recent addition to the United States’ anti-ballistic missile/interceptor toolkit. It entered production in 2008 and is primarily tasked with taking out threatening ballistic missiles in what’s known as their “terminal” phase (the ‘T’ in the acronym). This is actually the first part where a clarification is due. As Jeffrey Lewis recently highlighted in a Foreign Policy column, THAAD, and systems like it, including the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) interceptor, are designed to hit things as they zoom downward toward the earth–not as they go up.      This may seem like a trivial point, but Japan made a show of deploying its PAC-3 interceptors in Tokyo ahead of North Korea’s latest satellite launch. Of course, the Kwangmyongsong satellite had a one-way ticket out of the atmosphere and wouldn’t be coming back, making PAC-3, or hypothetically THAAD, useless. (North Korea does have a bunch of short- and medium-range SCUDs that THAAD would be great against, though.)      THAAD is particularly well-suited to intercept and destroy short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. Rod Lyon, in a recent post at the National Interest, helpfully catalogues some of THAAD’s tried-and-tested abilities, which attest to that fact. THAAD’s overall operation is similar to many other missile interceptor and surface-to-air missile systems: an X-Band active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar (AN/TPY-2) kicks off THAAD’s interception, detecting the target projectile. THAAD’s fire control and support equipment identifies, verifies, and initiates the launcher. The launcher–a road-mobile erector launcher, to be precise–finally releases the infrared seeker head-equipped THAAD missile which, according to the system’s manufacturer, then uses “kinetic energy to destroy [the] incoming missile.” In plain English, missile meets missile in mid-air; both missiles go “Boom.”      There’s a lot more to THAAD’s feature set. The “high altitude” part of the acronym isn’t there for show: THAAD is able to intercept incoming missiles at endo- and exo-atmospheric altitudes, with a maximum engagement altitude of roughly 93 miles above the earth’s surface. The missile itself can travel at speeds over Mach 8, placing it in the “hypersonic” category. Indeed, THAAD manufacturer Lockheed Martin is interested in developing an extended range THAAD variant to counter hypersonic glide vehicles, including China’s own WU-14.      Keeping this feature set in mind, why is China so upset about a potential THAAD deployment? The answer, I think, has to do more with the monitoring capabilities that are part of the THAAD package. Beijing isn’t, for instance, worried that a THAAD deployment in South Korea would threaten any ballistic missiles it would plausibly fire at the United States–again, THAAD only works against ballistic missiles in the terminal phase and not against inter-continental ones anyway. Lyon evaluates China’s concerns:      China’s right to believe that THAAD surveillance data could be transferred to other BMD assets protecting [the continental United States (CONUS)]. Indeed, one of THAAD’s missions would be to strengthen U.S. defenses against the possibility of North Korean ballistic missile attack on CONUS. So it has to be able to transfer data to CONUS-based radars and interceptors. But the United States already has a THAAD battery deployed on Guam, two AN/TPY-2 radars deployed in Japan (at Shariki and Kyogamisaki), space-based assets, plus a range of ship-borne radars and larger land-based radars in other parts of the Pacific theatre. Would a THAAD deployment in South Korea change much? The short answer is that it could improve early tracking of some Chinese missiles, depending on their launch point. Still, that might not make actual interception of those missiles much easier. ICBM warheads move fast. And sophisticated penetration-aids help to confuse missile defenses.      So, from the Chinese perspective, a THAAD deployment could shift the strategic stability needle ever so slightly away from its status quo equilibrium and advantage the United States, giving Washington better early warning and tracking of Chinese ICBMs. That, in itself, doesn’t seem like a serious impingement on China’s security or its nuclear deterrent. What’s interesting is reading China’s worries about a THAAD and AN/TPY-2 deployment on the Korean peninsula together with murmurs that Beijing is growing increasingly interested in a launch-on-warning nuclear posture. Does a THAAD deployment affect the credibility of China’s second-strike capabilities by giving the United States a greater early warning edge? Perhaps, but, as Lyon notes above, the difference would be marginal given the AN/TPY-2s already in Japan.      Assessing China’s position on THAAD in light of the system’s real capabilities, we should concede that Beijing does have some legitimate reasons to be upset, but I question if the negative implications for China’s security really outweigh the diplomatic cost to the bilateral relationship with South Korea, which had seen a sharp uptick over the past year. Moreover, it’s clear that South Korea’s security would benefit in important ways from a THAAD deployment–Pyongyang’s Toksa, SCUDs, and No Dong missiles would be a lot less threatening.      China and South Korea should be able to come to an understanding, but this won’t be possible as long as Beijing holds to its maximalist position on THAAD, refusing to abide a deployment of the interceptor on the peninsula. Are there alternatives? If you ask South Korea and the United States, then the answer is yes: China could change its approach to North Korea, making this THAAD business less necessary in the short-term. I wouldn’t count on that happening anytime soon, despite news of the United States and China making some progress on harsher sanctions. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has defended the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) anti-missile system in South Korea.

Prison Service Gold Command, the national group convened during serious incidents and disturbances, was deployed and the prisoner surrendered.  The incident was also reported to police. The previous day, staff had found four prisoners barricaded in a cell, and when they were able to see in, they saw one was tied up with a sheet over his head. The prisoners surrendered five hours later. Also on 11 May, a prisoner used a toilet brush studded with razor blades to slash and stab another inmate at HMP and YOI Swinfen Hall, Staffordshire. The attack was filmed on a mobile phone smuggled in, the prison service said. The victim suffered deep gashes to his head, face and ear before staff intervened and he was taken to Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham. Prisons Minister Andrew Selous said: \\"Our prison system needs reform, which is why we are giving governors greater freedoms to innovate to find better ways of rehabilitating offenders. \\"We have to ensure prisoners can be rehabilitated so they are no longer a danger to others.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses a series of incidents at HMP Highpoint and HMP and YOI Swinfen Hall, involving hostage situations and an inmate attack.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who thinks that, in America, his public declaration about his bisexuality stood in the way of so much he wanted to do?  Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, \\"If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.\\" In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, \\"It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was \\"the biggest mistake I ever made\\" and \\"I was always a closet heterosexual.\\" On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, \\"I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people.\\" Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in \\"puritanical\\" America, \\"I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.\\"Buckley wrote that Bowie \\"mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock\\", and was probably \\"never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual\\", instead experimenting \\"out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'.\\" Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—the singer and his first wife Angie \\"created their bisexual fantasy\\".

Article: Traditional fairytales are being given up by parents because they are too scary for their young children, a study found. Research uncovered that one in five parents has got rid of old literature such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Rapunzel in favour of more modem books. One third of parents said their children have been left in tears after hearing the  _ details of Little Red Riding Hood. And nearly half of mothers and fathers refuse to read Rumplesliltshin  to their kids as the themes of the story are kidnapping and killing. Similarly, Goldilocks and the Three Bears was also a tale likely to be left on the book shelf as parents felt it forgives stealing. The survey of 2,000 adults was completed to mark the launch of the hit US drama GRIMM   , which starts tonight at 9pm on Watch, and sees six drama series based on traditional fairytales. The survey found a quarter of parents questioned wouldn't consider reading fairytales to their kids. And 52 percent of the parents said Cinderella  didn't send a good message to their children as it describes a young woman doing housework all day. Steve Hornsey, General Manager of Watch, said: \\"Bedtime stories are supposed to calm children down and send them off to sleep soundly.But as we see in GMMM, fairytales can be dark and dramatic so it's understandable that parents worry about reading them to young 'children.As adults we can see the innocence in fairytales, but a five - year - old child could take them too literally.Despite the dark nature of classic fairytales, as: we see in GRIMM, good will defeat evil and there is always a moral to the story.\\" The study also found two thirds of mums and dads try to avoid Stories which might give their children nightmares. However half of parents said traditional tales are \\"more likely to have a strong moral message than a lot of modem kids' books, such as The Gruffato, The Hungary Caterpillar and the Mr Men books.

Please answer the following question: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.  Which group had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","output":"Group B, which presented somatic mutations, had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation.

He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Given a simple high-school level math question, you are required to solve it and provide the final answer. The final answer is always a single number. These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign. For decimal numbers, do not add extra zeros after the decimal point. For fractional numbers, separate the numerator and denominator using a forward slash (e.g. 3/25). Q: Let l be ((-26)/(-6))/(1/(-36)). Find the common denominator of 3 + (-2 - l/(-40)) and 1/4. A:","output":"The first step is to evaluate the value of l, which is ((-26)/(-6))/(1/(-36)). ((-26)/(-6)) can be calculated as 26/6 = 4.33 (to 2 decimal places). Then divide this by (1/(-36)), that calculates to -4.33 * -36 = 156. This value is a decimal number and there are no extra zeros after the decimal point, so it satisfies the conditions given. l = 156 Next simplify the expression for which we need a common denominator: 3 + (-2 - l/(-40)) = 3 + (-2 - 156/(-40)) We can simplify further:  = 3 + (-2 + 3.9) = approximately 4.9 (to 1 decimal place). Now, we have to find the common denominator of 4.9 and 1/4.  Here, since the first number is not a fraction, we simply convert it to a fraction format, which would be 49/10.  So, now we need to find the common denominator of 49/10 and 1/4.  For this, we can take the least common multiples (LCM) of 10 and 4. The multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, ..... The multiples of 4 are: 4 , 8, 12, 16, 20, ..... The first common multiple of 10 and 4 is 20; therefore, 20 is the least common multiple (LCM).

But I can use this background: Beginning in the late 1970’s, ozone depletion was recognized as a significant environmental issue. The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels.  What is an answer for this question: Which person learned less about the most dramatic decrease in ozone? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Ben learned less about the most dramatic decrease in ozone. While both Ben and Harry were studying the climatic history of Earth, their interests and focus areas were different. Ben was more attracted to learning about early Ice Ages, which may encompass studies about glaciation and the effect of climate change on ice coverage. On the other hand, Harry was curious about the Earth's atmosphere, specifically reading about ozone depletion and its consequences. Since the most dramatic decrease in ozone is a crucial aspect of the topic Harry was exploring, it's likely that he would have learned about it while researching ozone depletion. The background information provided about the ozone hole, its steady increase over the years, and the efforts in recent times to restore the ozone layer may have been within the scope of Harry's research, while Ben's study on early Ice Ages would not necessarily involve learning about ozone depletion. Thus, the answer to the question is that Ben learned less about the most dramatic decrease in ozone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Imagine that the rules of volleyball forbid the use of hands or arms---that's sepaktakraw . It's a difficult sport, but that isn't stopping the world from picking it up. The court where sepaktakraw is played is the size of one used for badminton doubles. A net and a plastic ball a little larger than a baseball are used. Two teams of three players(left inside, right inside, and server) take their places on either side. A teammate passes the ball to the server who kicks it over the net. Points are scored when the ball touches the court surface on the other side. How sepaktakraw began has been a hot topic. Many Asian cultures once had their own names and rules for it. In Thailand the sport can be found on a famous mural . It was also played to celebrate the writing of the nations' first constitution in 1933. however, various nations discussed to decide the official name and rules in 1960, At last, sepak is a Malay word for \\"kick\\", and takraw is Thai for \\"woven ball\\". International tournaments have been held for many years, but sepaktakraw continues to improve. It was introduced as an exhibition event at the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung. And though no other countries can b equal to Thailand in sepaktakraw, they will show improvement. Twenty-five continents on five continents now claim active teams that play internationally. Finally, a place in the Olympic Games is also being sought. If these changes continue, sepaktakraw may soon be familiar to all. Question: How did sepaktakraw get its name?

Roger Ailes told tall tale about belly dancer, boa constrictor: New book Roger Ailes, LEFT, and Rupert Murdoch in 1996, at a press conference announcing the creation of Fox News. (Richard Drew/Associated Press) In an appearance today on “CBS This Morning,” Gabriel Sherman, the unauthorized biographer of Fox News chief Roger Ailes, took aim at a central part of the network boss’s history. The issue concerns a great anecdote from Ailes’s early years as a professional. It was January 1968, and Ailes was executive producer of the Mike Douglas Show. Booked to appear on the Jan. 9 program was then-presidential hopeful Richard Nixon. Ailes ended up face-to-face with Nixon in his office, an encounter that came about via strange circumstances. Here’s how Ailes described those circumstances in a 2001 interview with Charlie Rose: “So somebody ran into me and said, ‘We’re having former Vice President Nixon come in and we have Little Egypt the belly dancer in the green room with a boa constrictor.’ So I said, ‘Put one of them in my office.’ And they ended up putting Nixon in my office. And I didn’t want to scare the boa constrictor or Nixon so I decided I had to keep them apart. I don’t think Nixon ever knew he was on the same show with a boa constrictor until maybe a week later somebody told him. And a belly dancer, by the way: Little Egypt was a famous belly dancer. Anyway, I went back to my office, there’s Nixon sitting there and he’s grumbling about, you know, it’s too bad a guy has to rely on a gimmick to get elected.” In his research for “The Loudest Voice in the Room,” Sherman has determined that things didn’t quite go down that way. “There was no belly dancer; there was no snake on the set of the Mike Douglas Show,” Sherman said this morning on CBS. He breaks things down on a just-posted mini-excerpt at New York magazine: [A]ccording to several of Ailes’s Mike Douglas colleagues who were present, there was no belly dancer named Little Egypt booked that day. Their assertion is backed up by the show’s talent logs, which I viewed. The guests during the Nixon taping, which took place on January 9, were the singer Margaret Whiting, the actress Stella Stevens, the Philadelphia Brass Ensemble, and Tony Sandler’s children. According to the talent log for that week’s shoots, the dance duo John Brascia and Tybee Arfa had been scheduled to come into the studio when Nixon was there, but were bumped back a day. Tybee, as she was known, was certainly exotic. But she never performed under the name Little Egypt. And the snake? “No one has any recollection of Tybee ever dancing with a boa,” recalled John Brascia’s daughter, Christina. On CBS, Sherman said that the story is “a wonderful cocktail party story that shows roger Ailes’s unrivaled ability to be a myth-maker.” The meeting with Nixon, insists Sherman, came in a “formative” period in the life of the then-27-year-old Ailes, who didn’t exactly stumble into a one-on-one with Nixon. “He wanted to work for Nixon. He wanted to become a media strategist,” said Sherman. This could be fun. Can the Fox News public relations team find any evidence that a snake appeared on the Jan. 9, 1968, edition of The Mike Douglas Show? What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses a claim made by Gabriel Sherman, the biographer of Fox News chief Roger Ailes, that Ailes fabricated a story about meeting Richard Nixon while Nixon was coincidentally on the same show as a belly dancer and a boa constrictor. Sherman states that, upon further investigation, there was no evidence of the belly dancer or the snake being on the show on the same day as Nixon, and suggests that Ailes's story is an example of his ability to create myths."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: What kind of personality test is the MBTI I found the following answer on Google: One of these four functions is dominant most of the time.

Can you tell me the answer to what is the most common subject of cycladic sculptures??","output":"Cycladic sculptures refer to the artistic creations originating from the ancient Cycladic civilization, which flourished around 3200-2000 BCE on the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea (part of modern-day Greece). The Cycladic culture is one of the three significant early Aegean civilizations, along with the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. The most common subject of Cycladic sculptures is the so-called \\"Cycladic figurines\\" or \\"Cycladic idols.\\" These figurines are predominantly found in the Early Cycladic II period (2800-2300 BCE) and are characterized by their simple, geometric and abstract forms. The majority of the sculptures depict female figures, nude and in various poses, suggesting that they may have represented goddesses or served a religious purpose, linked to beliefs in fertility, death, and afterlife. The aesthetic appearance of these figures emphasizes the aspects of minimalism and abstraction, which later became influential in the art world, especially in modern art movements like Cubism. Cycladic figurines are mainly made of local, high-quality marble that is abundant in the Cyclades and were carved using a variety of tools such as chisels, blades, and abrasives for a smoother finish. These figures are depicted standing or reclining, with their arms folded across their chest and elongated necks supporting their distinctive, lyre-shaped heads with prominent noses. They have little to no facial features other than the nose, and the lack of other details can be attributed to their symbolic or, perhaps, metaphysical nature. Although female figures dominate Cycladic sculptures, some male figures have been discovered as well. Male figurines are thought to have portrayed warriors, hunters, or possibly musicians, and are often classified as being anatomically distinguishable and engaged in an activity. For example, some figures hold weapons, musical instruments, or have their hands in positions indicating they would be handling tools. There are also a few abstract examples of Cycladic art in which the gender of the figure is difficult to identify. In addition to the figurines, Cycladic sculptures also involve pottery and smaller, functional objects such as stone vessels and tools. There are examples of engraved or painted pottery with themes related to the natural world, geometric patterns, and maritime scenes. However, the main fascination surrounding Cycladic art and its most common subject overwhelmingly revolves around the striking and enigmatic marble figurines. In summary, the most common subject of Cycladic sculptures is the Cycladic figurines, primarily representing female figures with minimalistic, abstract, and almost otherworldly characteristics. These marble figures not only provide unique insight into the artistic expressions of the ancient Cycladic civilization but have also played an influential role in shaping the course of modern art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...  I am facing a new situation today: Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which continent was inhabited by fewer turtles? A:","output":"Based on the provided background article, reptiles are a diverse group of animals that includes turtles, among other species. In the new situation presented, Asia is known to have a higher reptile population, while Africa has a larger bird population and very few reptiles.

The war was successful for Great Britain, which gained the bulk of New France in North America, Spanish Florida, some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies, the colony of Senegal on the West African coast, and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as Pontiac's War, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status. In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum. Prussia emerged as a new European great power. The involvement of Portugal, Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle. Spain lost Florida but gained French Louisiana and regained control of its colonies, e.g., Cuba and the Philippines, which had been captured by the British during the war. France and other European powers will soon avenge their defeat in 1778 when American Revolutionary War broke out, with hopes of destroying Britain's dominance once and for all.

The first symbol is 14, which is shorthand for the \\"14 Words\\" slogan: \\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\\" The second is 88, which stands for \\"Heil Hitler\\" (H being the 8th letter of the alphabet). Together, the numbers form a general endorsement of white supremacy and its beliefs. As such, they are ubiquitous within the white supremacist movement - as graffiti, in graphics and tattoos, even in screen names and e-mail addresses, such as aryanprincess1488@hate.net. Some white supremacists will even price racist merchandise, such as t-shirts or compact discs, for 14.88.      The symbol is most commonly written as 1488 or 14/88, but variations such as 14-88 or 8814 are also common.      Additional Images ||||| On Inauguration Day, Shia LaBeouf launched an art project called “He Will not Divide Us” at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York. Outside the museum is a camera and people can come and stand in front of it for as long as they want repeating the words “He will not divide us.” The video will be streamed continuously for four years, or as long as Donald Trump is President.      Yesterday, the “He Will Not Divide Us” official Twitter account tweeted out this video of a White Supremacist who showed up and started talking into the camera, including saying, as our cousin site Gossip Cop pointed out, something that sounds like “praise Hitler.”      White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down. This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi — #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017      LaBeouf, who has made multiple appearances in the live stream was there at the time, got into his face and screamed “he will not divide us” into the man’s ear. Before things got (more) physical, the man left, and the crowd cheered.      Other moments have been much more positive. At one point, a man was there by himself for a while. Eventually, a woman came and joined him, saying she had been watching from home and had become inspired.      [featured image via Featureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock, Inc.]      Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| He Will Not Divide Us/Twitter      “He Will Not Divide Us,” the four-year-long anti-Trump participatory art installation from Shia LaBeouf, Nastja Sade Ronkko, and Luke Turner, was the site of a showdown between actor LaBeouf and an unidentified white supremacist on Sunday, Raw Story reports. The project, at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, invites visitors to say the words “He will not divide us” into a camera for a 24-hour livestream, which will be broadcast on the web for the entirety of the Trump presidency.      The problem was that not everyone wanted to say “He will not divide us.” To be more specific, a Nazi showed up who wanted to say “1488,” instead. (Calling modern-day white supremacists Nazis may be imprecise in many cases, but this guy was literally wearing a SS M43 field cap, though he at least was ashamed of himself enough to remove the Totenkopf.) “1488,” of course, is a white supremacist code number that combines white supremacy’s 14-word creed with a reference to “Heil Hitler,” H being the eighth letter of the alphabet. It was created by white supremacist murderer David Lane, the same charmer who invented the “white genocide” myth. (Saying “Heil Hitler,” even in code, is another cutoff point where it probably ought to be ok to call someone a Nazi.)      Advertisement            LaBeouf, who was there at the time, sensed that a man wearing the uniform of a long-defeated army of racists might not be in the spirit of the thing, and, as can be seen in a video posted to a fan account for the project, successfully shut him down:*      White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down. This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi — #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017      Rather than engaging in the morally controversial act of Nazi-punching, LaBeouf decided that the answer to hate speech was more speech. He followed the guy around until he returned to the microphone (to tell the world, “We must secure the existence of the white race”) then simply out-yelled him while edging him out of frame. Watching the Nazi try to work his way back to the camera (and fail) is another bittersweet pleasure of the Trump era. Yes, the Nazi looks pathetic, and yes, this is a punch-free Nazi fiasco that we can all enjoy. But a funny web video is a poor consolation for the time—not so long ago!—when fewer Americans thought it was ok to become Nazis to begin with. ||||| Add a location to your Tweets      When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

The number 14 stands for a special phrase that means white people should live safe and have lots of white children.

Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and “bully #1”. Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style. On this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts. I was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning. I spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her: “What do you know about Machiavellianism?” I swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose. I now realize that she thought I was passive-aggressively accusing her of said word. They got really nasty (behind my back, of course). They retreated to the back for awhile, and left me by myself. Cue loud, mean girl laughter. When #1 resumed her post next to me at the front desk, I calmly told her, “I'm cashing out, and leaving. I'm uncomfortable.” And I did. It was noon.

Anti-terror police in Kenya have accused the British of ignoring their warnings that Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was a dangerous radical. Adebolajo was arrested in Kenya in 2010 on suspicion of leading a jihadist plot to cross the border into lawless Somalia and join the ranks of the Al Shabaab terrorist group. But the Kenyans claim that when they presented their evidence to the British Embassy, it was insisted Adebolajo had no criminal record. Scroll down for video. Michael Adebolajo in a Kenyan court in 2010 with five other men after he attempted to cross the border. Adebolajo (centre in black top) was sent back to Britain after claiming he had been tortured in Kenya. Sources in Kenya also claim the. British Embassy put them under pressure to release Adebolajo after he. complained he had been tortured, starved for two days and denied access. to a lawyer. And another Kenyan source yesterday claimed the British failed to help them build a case against Adebolajo. Adebolajo was detained for several days before being deported to the UK. It came as Adebolajo’s family claimed harassment by MI5 in the months before the attack may have ‘pushed him over the edge’. On his return to the UK from Kenya,. family members claim he was ‘pestered’ by MI5 agents who tried to. recruit him as an informant and infiltrate Islamic extremist groups. Adebolajo’s brother-in-law Abu Zuybyr. claimed the intelligence services put Adebolajo under pressure to spy on. Muslim clerics and become an informer. Mr Zuybyr, who is married to. Adebolajo’s sister Christiana, said: ‘That is what [Adebolajo’s] family. is saying: that the secret service pushed him over the edge.’ He said Adebolajo was ‘elated’ following the birth of his child, but ‘then things became a little strange’. The family of Adebolajo, pictured during a 2007 march in London, said he was harassed by MI5 in the months before the attack. Speaking to The Independent on Sunday, Mr Zuybyr said Adebolajo went to Nairobi in 2010 to study Arabic and Islam. Following his return to England, Mr Zuybyr said authorities repeatedly questioned family members about Adebolajo. His elder brother, Jeremiah, who had. gone to Saudi Arabia to teach English, was arrested and quizzed. And Mr. Zuybyr said he was questioned at gunpoint when he visited Yemen four. years ago to learn Arabic with his wife. He said: ‘When I came back to Britain,. MI5 contacted me and showed significant interest in Michael. I was. harassed for a while, with constant calls from people claiming to be. from the FBI.’ In Kenya, Adebolajo was seized with. five others after travelling by speedboat to an island off the coast. near Lamu Island, 68 miles from the Somali border. A married couple who owned a guest house where they had been staying and a worker were also arrested. The Kenyans believed Adebolajo, 28,. had played a crucial role in recruiting his co-accused, including two. secondary school-aged boys, after they were radicalised during weekly. visits to a mosque in Mombasa. It is believed the Kenyan cleric Sheikh Aboud Rogo – who was killed by gunmen in Mombasa last year – had helped to fund the men. Adebolajo was eventually deported without charge but the Kenyans insist they warned the British that he was dangerous. Mombasa’s anti-terrorist police chief Elijah Rop said: ‘We advised the British police about the man but they ignored us. ‘That is the man we deported to the UK. in 2010 after discovering he is among Islamic radicals who were. recruited to train as Al Shabaab in Somalia three years ago.’ A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28,. brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the. killing.

At the. time of Adebolajo’s arrest, the security services were aware of the risk. that radicalised British Muslims were heading to Somalia to join with. Al Shabaab, which has links to Al Qaeda. Only two months before, the then-head. of MI5 Jonathan Evans had warned Britons were training in Somalia and it. was ‘only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets. inspired by those who are today fighting alongside Al Shabaab’. It is now accepted that Al Qaeda cells in Mombasa were at their peak around 2010. Samantha Lewthwaite, the fugitive. ‘white widow’ of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay is still on the run over. her role in a suspected plot to bomb western hotels in the city. However the security forces appear to. have been relaxed that Adebolajo – who was travelling under the name of. Michael Olemindis Ndemolajo – may have been prepared to train and fight. with the brutal Al Shabaab. Kenyan government spokesman Muthui. Kariuki said: ‘We handed him to British security agents in Kenya and he. seems to have found his way to London and mutated to Michael Adebolajo. The Kenyan government cannot be held responsible for what happened to. him after we handed him to British authorities.’ Father Lee Rigby was killed in the attack on Woolwich last week. Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave. After their arrest Adebolajo  and the. eight co-accused were taken to Mombasa and spent a number of days in. prison before appearing before a magistrate. Kenyan detectives suspected Adebolajo. may have been a ringleader because he was most vocal in court and. appeared to know how to ‘play the system’. In court he claimed: ‘We are being tortured by police and we haven’t eaten for two days now. ‘We have been denied the right to talk. to our family members and lawyer. We are being treated as criminals and. we are innocent.’ The court told police it had three. days to build a case but after the clean bill of health from the British. embassy Adebolajo was deported. Another Kenyan source yesterday. accused the British of failing to help them build a case against. Adebolajo. He said: ‘It was a major anti-terror investigation and we. were given three days by the courts to build up a case.’ Last night the Foreign Office. confirmed Adebolajo had been arrested in 2010 and it gave consular. assistance ‘as normal’ in the circumstances. A Foreign Office statement said: ‘We. can confirm a British national was arrested in Kenya in 2010. The. Foreign and Commonwealth Office provided consular assistance as normal. for British nationals.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about a man named Michael Adebolajo who was arrested in Kenya in 2010. He was suspected of being a dangerous radical and of planning to join a terrorist group called Al Shabaab in Somalia. The Kenyan police warned the British about him, but they claim the British ignored their warnings. Adebolajo was eventually sent back to Britain, where his family says he was harassed by MI5, the British intelligence agency. They think this harassment might have pushed him over the edge and led him to commit violent acts. In summary, this article is about a man who was arrested in Kenya for terrorism suspicions, but the British did not take the warnings seriously. Later, his family claims he was harassed by British intelligence agents, which might have led him to commit violence."},{"instruction":"In this task, you will be presented with a passage and have to answer a question based on your understanding of the events inferred from the passage.

Ministers said they \\"maximise\\" best use of public funding and disappointment for some producers was inevitable. Young's upcoming film is about the former Cardiff City player Robin Friday. But he said he was \\"taken aback\\" by the way the Welsh film industry was organised when he applied for support from the Welsh government's media investment fund. He told BBC Wales: \\"We have put together a lot of financing for this movie, we've got some big stars in it. \\"I went through a process with the Welsh government and they basically passed on it, and it looks like we are going to have to be shooting it in England or Ireland later this summer.\\" The Welsh government said it was supporting the creative industries in Wales, which have a \\"global reputation\\" and a \\"very strong pipeline of projects seeking to film here\\". It said independent industry experts provided advice on commercial investments and the Welsh government's media investment budget, backed by advice from Pinewood Pictures, was \\"delivering tangible results\\". \\"We would be rightly criticised for not taking strong measures to protect and bring value from our investments,\\" a spokesman said. \\"It is therefore inevitable that this will bring disappointment to some producers, but we will continue to work with them to find ways in which to assist their productions to be filmed in Wales.\\" Young has had a successful career in animation and film since TV series SuperTed launched on S4C in 1982 and his latest film Norm of the North had its Welsh premiere in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, on Tuesday. Young said public funds that support the creative industries should be directed at commercial projects, and criticised the involvement of \\"bureaucrats\\" in making decisions about funding new films. He said the Welsh government had \\"got to gather around them people who really know how to package films and how to market and sell them, rather than bureaucrats\\". Asked about the Welsh government's film investment budget, he said: \\"The sense I had is that there's a very uneasy relationship between the politicians and the people who are appointed from the industry to monitor the thing.\\" He conceded he \\"may have a twisted view\\" because his application for funding for his Robin Friday film was turned down, but said the government's creative industries policy \\"needs to be commercial\\". \\"I'm a very commercial director, and I think that if the industry is going to work in Wales then they've got to become very commercial,\\" he said. \\"You can make all of the esoteric films that you want... but at the same time, if the industry is going to stand on its own it needs to be commercial.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article is about Hollywood producer Mike Young expressing his disappointment and concerns regarding the lack of support for his upcoming film project. His movie, which is about former Cardiff City player Robin Friday, did not receive financial backing from the Welsh government's media investment fund. As a result, Young has decided to shoot the film elsewhere, most likely in England or Ireland. Young criticized the organization of the Welsh film industry and questioned the involvement of bureaucrats in funding decisions. He believes that public funds should be allocated to commercial projects and stresses the importance of having industry experts to package, market, and sell films. The Welsh government responded by stating that they are supporting creative industries in Wales and that independent industry experts provide advice on commercial investments. They emphasized that their media investment budget is delivering tangible results, but acknowledged that some producers may be disappointed when their projects are not funded. The government's focus is on protecting and bringing value from their investments, while continuing to work with producers to find ways of supporting their productions in Wales. Mike Young has had a successful career in animation and film since the 1980s, with notable works like SuperTed and Norm of the North.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.  and the situation: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.  Answer the following question: In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","output":"ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. This is because sample A has a higher respiration rate, and during cellular respiration, energy is converted from glucose, in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. In contrast, sample B has no respiration rate induced, which means that it is not converting glucose into ATP molecules through cellular respiration."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

These high-profile hacks serve as a stark reminder of the importance of bolstering internet security and combatting cybercrimes across the globe. Several steps have been taken by the EU to strengthen its cybersecurity infrastructure. One such initiative includes collaborating with member countries to develop advanced cybersecurity strategies and exchanging best practices in a bid to safeguard their online presence. Furthermore, the EU has been working on enhancing public-private partnerships to ensure comprehensive protection for both government and private sector institutions. In light of these embarrassing hacks, the Spanish government has reportedly acted swiftly to rectify the situation, restoring the original images and content on the EU and Ahmadinejad's websites. Spain's Ministry of Industry, which oversees the country's internet infrastructure, has also launched an investigation into the breach, aiming to identify the perpetrators and enforce strict penalties on those responsible. While the hackers' motives may have been to ridicule prominent figures, they inadvertently drew attention to the crucial issue of cybersecurity. As the world continues to evolve digitally, threats to privacy and security are on the rise. It is imperative that governments recognize the significance of investing in comprehensive cybersecurity solutions to protect their citizens and defend their virtual borders.

These attributes will be used to generate an unambiguous question. Part #2: Unique Answer from the Table Usage: ['6 March 2013', 'Dasarath Rangasala Stadium, Kathmandu', 'Bangladesh', '0-4', '2014 AFC Challenge Cup qualification'] Explanation: The answer to the question should be unique, and in this case, \\"0-4\\" is the unique score for the match against Bangladesh. Part #3: Contiguous Text Span from the Table Usage: 'Dasarath Rangasala Stadium, Kathmandu' Explanation: The answer should be a contiguous text span from the table. In this case, \\"Dasarath Rangasala Stadium, Kathmandu\\" is a valid text span as it is part of the Venue column in the table, representing the venue where the match was held. Part #4: Answer without Reading/Understanding the Table Usage: Q: What was the score of the match against Bangladesh held on 6 March 2013 in the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup qualification? A: 0-4 Explanation: The question requires the reader to find the specific row and column in the table, which contains the answer.

Do all plants live on the land? Some plants do live in the water. To do this, they have evolved special traits. Plants that live in water are called aquatic plants. Living in water has certain benefits. There is certainly plenty of water! The plant does not need special traits to absorb, transport, or conserve water. They do not need a large root system. They do not need a strong stem to hold up the plant. The plant uses the water for support. Dont think water plants have it easy, though. They also face challenges. Living in water isnt that easy. They do need some special traits to survive. It is tough for the plant to reproduce. Pollination by wind or animals cant happen under water. Sunlight cannot reach very far beneath the waters surface. Some aquatic plants have floating flowers and leaves.  After reading the above, is \\"No\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Are there benefits to living in water\\"?","output":"Indeed, your understanding is correct. The correct answer to the question \\"Are there benefits to living in water?\\" is \\"Yes.\\" There are several benefits for aquatic plants living in water, as highlighted in the information you provided, which includes: 1. Abundant water availability: Aquatic plants do not need to develop specialized mechanisms for water absorption, transportation, or conservation due to the constant supply of water in their surroundings. 2. Reduced need for a large root system: Since water is readily available, aquatic plants do not require an extensive root system to search for water sources, unlike their terrestrial counterparts. 3. Support and structural simplicity: Aquatic plants do not need a very strong stem to hold up the plant as the water provides buoyancy and support. This allows them to have more straightforward and less resource-demanding structural adaptations. Despite these benefits, aquatic plants face their unique set of challenges, such as reproduction, effective pollination, and access to sunlight. Therefore, these plants have evolved other specialized traits to overcome these difficulties to survive in their aquatic environments."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
