Amidst the stark white walls, a lone figure paced down the corridor, his messy black hair falling into his downcast eyes. This was Kuro, the test subject, caught in the web of curious experimentation. Kuro, dressed in an orange jumpsuit that exaggerated his slender figure, approached a room where a confident, yet sassy agent named Ryuu awaited. With his short blonde hair complimenting his playful blue eyes, Ryuu was a striking contrast to Kuro. He wore a skin-tight latex dark blue bodysuit that hugged his lithe physique, accentuating his undeniable allure. Entering the room, Kuro's shy and quiet demeanor contrasted with Ryuu's sassy and playful attitude. Their distinct differences seemed to bind them in an inexplicable and unspoken connection. \\"Ah, the elusive test subject finally joins the party,\\" Ryuu teased, casting his gaze down towards Kuro's attire. \\"Quite a fashion statement you've got going on there, Kuro.\\" Blushing slightly, Kuro fidgeted with the tie around his pants. \\"It's... um... for agility training. They said it helps them track my movements better,\\" he stammered, his voice barely above a whisper. With a smirk, Ryuu leaned against a nearby console. The tightness of his bodysuit emphasized his slender stature, and a small bulge hinted at unseen secrets. \\"Well, if they're into that, who am I to judge? Besides, you make it work, Kuro,\\" he jeered, his tone playfully seductive. Kuro, unable to meet Ryuu's teasing gaze, awkwardly shifted on his feet. \\"The researchers... they've been kind to me,\\" he muttered, offering a glimmer of hope in his voice. \\"They treat me with respect, unlike the others.\\" Ryuu's expression softened, his playful demeanor giving way to understanding. \\"It's probably because they understand your potential, Kuro. They see what they can mold you into,\\" he replied, genuinely. \\"But remember, not everyone here has your best interests at heart.\\" Kuro's eyes widened, fear mingling with the curiosity that burned within him. \\"What do you mean, Ryuu? Why are you telling me this?\\" With a flick of his wrist, Ryuu turned on a holographic monitor displaying schematics of the Enrichment Center. \\"I work for the corporation that owns this place, Kuro. My job is to ensure their interests align with our human assets,\\" he explained, his voice laced with a mix of resolve and protectiveness. \\"But seeing the way they treat you... it ain't right.

Basic concepts and principles of decision trees A. Decision tree for classification B. Decision tree for regression C. Nodes, branches and leaves in decision trees","output":"II. Basic concepts and principles of decision trees A. Decision tree for classification: Decision trees are a popular machine learning technique used for solving classification problems. In a decision tree for classification, the input variables are used to make a sequence of decisions that ultimately lead to a class label for the given input. The tree consists of nodes, branches, and leaves, where each node represents a decision based on a specific attribute or feature, each branch represents a possible value of that attribute or feature, and each leaf represents a class label. B. Decision tree for regression: Decision trees can also be used for regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric outcome instead of a categorical class label. In a decision tree for regression, the input variables are again used to make a sequence of decisions, but instead of predicting a class label, each leaf node represents a predicted numeric value. C. Nodes, branches, and leaves in decision trees: Nodes are the decision points in a decision tree, where different attributes or features are considered to make a decision. Each node divides the dataset based on a specific attribute or feature, resulting in branches that correspond to the different possible attribute values. These branches lead to subsequent nodes or leaves, which represent the decision or prediction made at that point in the tree. Branches connect nodes and represent the different possible outcomes or paths based on the attribute values. Each branch represents a specific value of the attribute or feature being considered at a particular node. The number of branches corresponds to the number of distinct attribute values. Leaves are the final nodes in a decision tree and represent the predicted class label or numeric value. Each leaf node corresponds to a specific outcome or prediction. In a classification tree, each leaf represents a class label, while in a regression tree, each leaf represents a predicted numeric value. Understanding the basic concepts and principles of decision trees, such as the structure of nodes, branches, and leaves, is essential for effectively utilizing this machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks. By analyzing the decision paths and outcomes in a decision tree, valuable insights can be gained to make informed decisions and predictions for various problem domains."},{"instruction":"III.

Принятие решений на основе классов в листовых узлах","output":"III. Принцип работы деревьев решений для классификации A. Расчет метрики неопределенности для классификации: Перед тем как принять решение о разделении данных на определенную категорию, необходимо оценить степень неопределенности. Это делается путем расчета метрики неопределенности, такой как энтропия или индекс Джини. Метрика неопределенности измеряет, насколько смешаны классы внутри данного поддерева. Чем выше значение метрики неопределенности, тем больше неопределенность в данных и сложнее принять решение о классификации. B. Выбор наилучшего признака и значения разделения: Для построения оптимального дерева решений необходимо выбрать наилучший признак и соответствующее значение разделения на каждом узле. Это достигается путем вычисления показателя качества разделения, такого как прирост информации или коэффициент Джини. Показатель качества разделения позволяет оценить, насколько хорошо данное разделение разделяет классы и уменьшает неопределенность данных. C. Построение дерева решений рекурсивно: Построение дерева решений происходит рекурсивно, начиная с корневого узла и последовательно строя узлы и листовые узлы. На каждом шаге выбирается наилучший признак и значение разделения, и данные разделяются на две или более подгруппы в соответствии с этим разделением. Этот процесс продолжается до тех пор, пока достигнуты условия остановки, такие как достижение максимальной глубины дерева или малая энтропия в листовых узлах. D. Принятие решений на основе классов в листовых узлах: После построения дерева решений и достижения листовых узлов каждый лист представляет собой конкретный класс. Когда поступает новый набор данных, происходит проход по дереву, и на основе значений признаков принимается решение о классификации. Данный процесс осуществляется путем сопоставления значений признаков с соответствующими значениями разделения в узлах и принятием решения в зависимости от класса, представленного в листовом узле. Понимание принципа работы деревьев решений для классификации и этапов их построения является ключевым для успешного использования данного метода машинного обучения в задачах классификации. Использование подходящих метрик неопределенности, выбор наилучшего признака и значения разделения, а также последовательное построение дерева решений позволяют эффективно принимать решения и достигать высокой точности классификации."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I have had opportunities to demonstrate my leadership skills in two distinct situations. One is upon graduating with my master’s degree in 2021, I joined the Information Center of the National Medical Products Administration. In February of the same year, the department organized a Lunar New Year celebration and required someone to direct the MV (music video) for the event. Drawing on my background in design and experience as a class leader in school, I took on this task. My main responsibilities involved overseeing the overall concept, personnel arrangement, and production of the MV. To begin with, I collaborated with several younger colleagues to brainstorm and select a suitable song. We ultimately settled on Pu Shu’s upbeat track “New Boy” and named the MV “New NMPAICer” after the center’s English name, NMPAIC. To ensure that the lyrics of the song aligned with the center’s past and future work, I enlisted two colleagues with strong writing skills as the song lyricists. Meanwhile, another colleague who excelled at using a handheld gimbal took charge of filming the MV. Additionally, I organized the participation of two young employees from each department in the center for the MV recording and voice recording. I further gathered all the young participants from various departments and shared the concept and ideas for the MV. After familiarizing myself with their specialties, I guided them in their performances and actions for different scenes, including office areas, the gym, and corridors. Each individual had their own unique actions, such as singing and dancing, walking and singing while holding files in the office area, or jogging and singing in the gym. This showcased the youthful energy of the center. The final MV also featured behind-the-scenes footage and a top 10 summary of the center’s work, which I synthesized, added animations to, and produced. The MV received applause and accolades from everyone in the center upon its airing. Some senior colleagues found it particularly innovative and inspiring and even approached me to obtain copies for their friends and family. Consequently, I gained recognition within the organization for my creativity and organizational skills, despite only recently joining. Another case is in the latter half of 2019, due to my exceptional communication skills demonstrated during the promotion of an art exhibition in 2018, my mentor appointed me as the leader of the promotion team for the Soft Love art exhibition in 2019. The team comprised nine members. As the team leader, my primary responsibility was to lead the promotion team in executing all the necessary promotional work for the art exhibition. Given the limited budget, I developed a comprehensive plan that entailed building momentum prior to the exhibition, inviting influencers to visit during the event, and collaborating with popular local stores to increase exposure. I undertook a thorough search on the social media platform Little Red Book to identify bloggers specializing in exploring exhibitions in Beijing. I ensured outreach to various target groups, including fashionistas, art influencers, and moms who recommended children’s products. Consequently, I collaborated with three team members who were active users of Little Red Book and Dianping, a consumer review platform, to create a list of suitable bloggers and their contact information. Additionally, I assigned two talkative team members to contact newspapers and magazines for interview invitations and to seek collaboration with chain beverage stores in high-traffic areas of Beijing. Moreover, the remaining three team members, who were relatively introverted, were responsible for the behind-the-scenes design work for promotional materials related to collaborations and influencer visits. Throughout the course of one month, the team held two meetings every week to stay on track. Our efforts proved successful as we established a partnership with a well-known Chinese milk tea chain for collaboration. Our promotional materials were displayed at their Sanlitun store. Furthermore, we engaged six bloggers, including art exhibition enthusiasts, Beijing couple bloggers, and influential mom bloggers. We conducted joint promotions on four platforms: WeChat Official Accounts, Weibo, Dianping, and Little Red Book. The exhibition garnered over 2000 visitors in attendance and exceeded ¥200,000 in sales. This experience significantly enhanced my communication and teamwork skills. In summary, these two instances demonstrate my capabilities in design creativity, organization, planning, and leveraging the strengths of team members. Currently working in the government sector, where my role involves providing digital services for regulatory purposes, I have become acquainted with the leading position of the United Kingdom in e-government and the establishment of the Government Digital Service, which focuses on the digitalization of government affairs. With significant overlap between our work domains, I propose establishing a Sino-British digitalization forum if awarded the Chevening Leadership Scholarship. This forum would facilitate regular exchange of experiences in design, development, and new technologies. Furthermore, I would leverage my promotional skills to publicize outstanding cases and practices from both China and the UK.","output":"Leadership refers to individuals effectively utilizing their expertise and recognizing team members' strengths to influence and motivate them towards common goals.

In February of the same year, the department organized a Lunar New Year celebration and required someone to direct the MV (music video) for the event. Drawing on my background in design and experience as a class leader in school, I took on this task. My main responsibilities involved overseeing the overall concept, personnel arrangement, and production of the MV. To begin with, I collaborated with several younger colleagues to brainstorm and select a suitable song. We ultimately settled on Pu Shu’s upbeat track “New Boy” and named the MV “New NMPAICer” after the center’s English name, NMPAIC. To ensure that the lyrics of the song aligned with the center’s past and future work, I enlisted two colleagues with strong writing skills as the song lyricists. Meanwhile, another colleague who excelled at using a handheld gimbal took charge of filming the MV. Additionally, I organized the participation of two young employees from each department in the center for the MV recording and voice recording. I further gathered all the young participants from various departments and shared the concept and ideas for the MV. After familiarizing myself with their specialties, I guided them in their performances and actions for different scenes, including office areas, the gym, and corridors. Each individual had their own unique actions, such as singing and dancing, walking and singing while holding files in the office area, or jogging and singing in the gym. This showcased the youthful energy of the center. The final MV also featured behind-the-scenes footage and a top 10 summary of the center’s work, which I synthesized, added animations to, and produced. The MV received applause and accolades from everyone in the center upon its airing. Some senior colleagues found it particularly innovative and inspiring and even approached me to obtain copies for their friends and family. Consequently, I gained recognition within the organization for my creativity and organizational skills, despite only recently joining.","output":"Upon graduating with my master’s degree in 2021, I joined the Information Center of the National Medical Products Administration.

Need to get their creation dates displayed. Each time both file change, need to have their updated dates. How ever there is challenge to get the Metadata, what are the other options to track both files date/time.","output":"If obtaining the metadata of the input files is challenging, there are a couple of alternate options you can consider to track the creation dates or updated dates of the files: 1. File System Events: Instead of relying on metadata, you can use file system event monitoring to track changes to the input files. Most operating systems provide file system event APIs or libraries that allow you to receive notifications when a file is created, modified, or deleted. By subscribing to these events, you can keep track of the changes to the files and update their respective dates. 2. File Hashing: Another option is to compute and compare the hash values of the file contents. You can create a hash of the file at the start (previous) and compare it with the hash of the current version to determine if changes have been made. While this approach won't give you the exact creation or modification dates, it can help identify changes between the two versions of the files. 3. Timestamp in the File: If you have control over the file format, you can include a timestamp field or metadata within the file itself. Whenever the file is updated, this timestamp can be modified accordingly. However, this requires modifying the file format and any associated processes that handle the file. It's worth noting that these alternatives may not be as accurate or reliable as obtaining the file metadata directly. If possible, it is generally preferable to find a way to access the metadata of the input files to get the precise creation and modification dates."},{"instruction":"what other options we have","output":"If obtaining the file metadata or using alternate methods like file system events or file hashing is not feasible or accurate enough, you can consider the following options to track the dates of the input files: 1. File Naming Convention: Implement a file naming convention that incorporates the date and time information. Whenever a file is updated, rename it with the updated date or timestamp at the end of the filename. This way, you can infer the creation and modification dates from the filenames themselves. 2. File Versioning: Maintain a versioning system for the input files. Each time a file is modified, create a new version with an incremented version number or timestamp appended to the filename. This will provide a history of the changes made to the files and their respective dates. 3. Change Log: Keep a separate log or record of the changes made to the input files. Whenever a file is updated, record the date and time of the update in the log. This log can serve as a reference for tracking the modification dates of the files. 4. Revision Control Systems: Utilize revision control systems like Git, Subversion, or Mercurial to track the changes made to the input files. These systems record detailed information about commits, modifications, and timestamps. By using these systems, you can easily track the changes and their associated dates. Keep in mind that these options may require manual intervention or additional processes to track and maintain the dates accurately. It's recommended to choose an approach that aligns with your specific requirements and limitations."},{"instruction":"Like to Automate in such a way each time files tables are updated with date/timestamp.","output":"To automate the process of updating the files with a date or timestamp each time they are modified or updated, you can consider the following steps: 1. Write a script or program: Create a script or program (e.g., using a scripting language like Python, shell scripting, or a programming language of your choice) that will handle the automation process. 2. File comparison: Within the script, include logic to compare the previous version of the input file with the current version to identify if any changes have been made. This can be done by comparing file sizes, hash values, or content differences, depending on the requirements and characteristics of the files. 3. Update file metadata: If changes are detected in the input file, update the file's metadata (e.g., modification date or a custom attribute) to reflect the current date and time. This can be achieved using programming libraries or system-specific commands to modify the file attributes. 4. Logging or recording: If you want to keep track of the update history, you can log or record the file modifications along with their corresponding date and time. This can be done by appending entries to a log file or database table within the script. 5. Automation scheduling: Set up a scheduled task or cron job (depending on the operating system you are using) to run the script at regular intervals or whenever there are changes to the files. 6. Execute the script: Test and execute the script to ensure that it automatically detects and updates the files with the appropriate date or timestamp each time they are modified. By following these steps, you can automate the process of updating the date or timestamp of the files whenever they are changed, providing you with an automated tracking system."},{"instruction":"как в three.js сделать, чтобы камера поворачивалась туда, куда у меня направлен курсор?","output":"В three.js вы можете обновить направление камеры в соответствии с положением курсора на экране с помощью следующей логики: 1.

They are essential for the structure and function of living organisms. There are four main types of macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Carbohydrates are a source of energy and include sugars and starches. They are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Proteins are involved in many functions, including building and repairing tissues, transporting molecules, and acting as enzymes. They are made up of smaller units called amino acids, which are connected by chemical bonds. Lipids are fats and oils that store energy and provide insulation and protection. They are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, and include substances such as fats, oils, and cholesterol. Nucleic acids store and transmit genetic information. There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). They are made up of smaller units called nucleotides. Overall, macromolecules are big molecules that play important roles in the structure and functioning of living things."},{"instruction":"Explain in simple terms what are monomers","output":"Monomers are small, simple molecules that can join together to form larger, more complex molecules called polymers. Think of monomers as the building blocks of polymers. Just like how Lego bricks can be combined in different ways to build various structures, monomers can be linked together in different arrangements to create different types of polymers. For example, in carbohydrates, monomers called sugars can connect to form long chains or rings. In proteins, monomers called amino acids can link together to create a chain, and these chains can fold into specific shapes to carry out different functions. Each type of polymer has its own unique set of monomers and arrangement, giving it specific properties and functions. So, monomers are like the puzzle pieces that come together to form the larger picture, which is the polymer."},{"instruction":"Explain in simple terms carbohydrates saccarides","output":"Carbohydrates are one type of macromolecule, and they are an important source of energy for our bodies. They are made up of smaller sugar molecules called saccharides. Imagine saccharides as small building blocks that can join together to form larger carbohydrate molecules. Each saccharide is like a tiny piece of a puzzle that can fit together with other saccharides. Carbohydrates can be simple or complex. Simple carbohydrates, also known as sugars, consist of just one or two saccharides. Examples of simple carbohydrates are glucose, fructose, and sucrose (table sugar). Complex carbohydrates are made up of many saccharides joined together in a chain. Starch, which is found in foods like rice and potatoes, is an example of a complex carbohydrate. When we eat carbohydrates, our bodies break them down into individual saccharides, which can be used as an energy source by our cells. If we have more carbohydrates than we need for immediate energy, our bodies can store them as glycogen for later use. In summary, carbohydrates are macromolecules made of saccharide building blocks. They provide us with energy and can be simple or complex depending on the number of saccharides they contain."},{"instruction":"How are carbohydrates a good source of carbon","output":"Carbohydrates are a good source of carbon because they are composed mainly of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The carbon atoms form the backbone of the carbohydrate molecule, giving it stability and structure. Plants are able to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into simple sugars through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use energy from the sun to combine carbon dioxide with water, resulting in the formation of glucose, a simple sugar. Glucose is then used by the plant for energy or can be further converted and stored as complex carbohydrates like starch or cellulose. When animals or humans consume plants or plant-based foods, they can break down the carbohydrates into glucose. Through a series of metabolic processes, glucose is utilized by the body to fuel various cellular activities and provide energy for bodily functions. The presence of carbon in carbohydrates is crucial as it forms the structural foundation of these molecules, enables the energy storage potential, and facilitates their breakdown for energy release. Thus, carbohydrates serve as a significant source of carbon for organisms in the natural world."},{"instruction":"How are carbohydrates a good source of carbon for metabolic reactions","output":"Carbohydrates are a good source of carbon for metabolic reactions because they contain a high density of carbon atoms within their molecular structure. When carbohydrates are broken down through processes like digestion or cellular respiration, the carbon atoms are released and can be used in various metabolic reactions within the body. During digestion, carbohydrates are broken down into their individual sugar molecules, such as glucose. Glucose serves as a primary fuel source for cells. Through a series of metabolic reactions, glucose enters the cells and undergoes processes like glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, where it is further broken down to generate energy. In these metabolic reactions, the carbon atoms from glucose are extracted and utilized in other important processes. For example, carbon atoms can be used for the synthesis of other organic molecules like lipids, nucleic acids, and amino acids, which are essential for cell growth, repair, and various biological functions. Moreover, the carbon atoms from carbohydrates can participate in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, which are vital for building complex molecules involved in cellular structures and metabolic pathways. In summary, carbohydrates serve as a good source of carbon for metabolic reactions because they contain a high concentration of carbon atoms. These carbon atoms can be utilized in numerous cellular processes, including energy production, synthesis of essential biomolecules, and the formation of structural components."},{"instruction":"Explain in simple terms why carbohydrate is good for the brain","output":"Carbohydrates are good for the brain because they provide it with the energy it needs to function properly. The brain is a very active organ that requires a constant supply of energy to perform its various tasks. When we consume carbohydrates, our bodies break them down into glucose, which is the main source of energy for the brain. Glucose is transported through the bloodstream to the brain cells, where it is used as fuel to carry out important functions like thinking, memory, and coordinating our movements. Carbohydrates provide a quick and readily available source of glucose for the brain. Compared to other nutrients, carbohydrates are efficiently and rapidly broken down into glucose, making it easily accessible to meet the energy demands of the brain. Additionally, carbohydrates can help regulate mood and improve cognitive function. When we consume carbohydrates, our bodies release a hormone called serotonin, which plays a role in promoting feelings of well-being and happiness. Adequate levels of serotonin contribute to improved mood and mental clarity. It's important to note that not all carbohydrates are the same. Simple carbohydrates, like those found in candy or sugary drinks, provide a quick burst of energy but are quickly used up by the brain. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables release glucose slowly, providing a steady and sustained supply of energy for the brain. In summary, carbohydrates are good for the brain because they provide the necessary energy in the form of glucose. A balanced intake of healthy carbohydrates ensures that the brain receives the fuel it needs to function optimally, promoting cognitive abilities, mood regulation, and overall brain health."},{"instruction":"Explain in simple terms what is glycogen","output":"Glycogen is a type of complex carbohydrate that serves as a storage form of glucose in animals, including humans. Think of glycogen as a reserve tank of energy stored in our bodies. When we consume carbohydrates, such as grains, fruits, or vegetables, our bodies break them down into glucose, which can be used immediately for energy. However, when we have more glucose than we need at the moment, our bodies convert the excess glucose into glycogen and store it in our liver and muscles. Imagine glycogen as a string of glucose molecules all connected together. When our bodies need energy, such as during exercise or between meals, the stored glycogen is broken down into individual glucose molecules again. These glucose molecules are then released into the bloodstream and transported to cells throughout the body to be used as fuel. The ability to store glucose as glycogen is important because it allows our bodies to have a readily available source of energy when we need it. It's like having a backup supply of fuel to keep us going during times when we haven't eaten recently or are engaging in physical activity. Overall, glycogen is a stored form of glucose that provides energy to our bodies when needed. It helps ensure a constant supply of fuel for our muscles, brain, and other organs between meals or during exercise."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) invited leaders in the AI space, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Nvidia president Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and X chair Elon Musk to a bipartisan AI Insight Forum. The forum was closed to the public and media, but some tech leaders prepared remarks or spoke to reporters outside the event. Zuckerberg said in prepared remarks that “Congress should engage with AI to support innovation and safeguards.” He said there are two defining issues for AI: safety and access. Meta builds safeguards into its generative AI models and is deliberate about how to roll out AI-powered products. But the company also believes powerful AI models are “going to be an increasingly important driver of opportunity in the future,” Zuckerberg said. “We think policymakers, academics, civil society, and industry should all work together to minimize the potential risks of this new technology, but also to maximize the potential benefits,” Zuckerberg said. “If you believe this generation of AI tools is a meaningful step forward, then it’s important not to undervalue the potential upside.” Zuckerberg touted Meta’s “open sourcing” of its Llama 2 model to provide access to AI models. The Meta CEO noted balancing regulation and innovation is important so that the US continues to lead the AI race, something he’s brought up before. On the other hand, X’s Musk, who started an AI company recently, told reporters outside the forum that the government needs a federal AI oversight agency. Reuters reports Musk told reporters that “it’s important for us to have a referee” so that companies do not run AI products unchecked. The New York Times reports several tech leaders remarked on the importance of regulating the technology, with OpenAI’s Altman saying he believes policymakers want “to do the right thing” and is impressed with how fast the government wants to create rules around the technology. Schumer, who previously called on peers to “pick up the pace” around AI regulation, said the forum was important to understand more of the technology and told reporters after the forum that the US cannot rush rulemaking. But while tech companies welcomed the opportunity to speak behind closed doors to policymakers, others expressed concern about the private nature of the forum. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) criticized the forum, saying it was a way for tech giants to influence policies. Ramayya Krishnan, dean of the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, tells The Verge that other AI Insight Forums have to be public. “We need more public hearings so we have more transparency into how the regulations are being crafted,” Krishnan said. “I hope other forums are open to the public.” Concerns over regulatory capture — when an industry can dictate how laws are made — rose as Big Tech companies involved in AI called for regulation, potentially leaving behind smaller companies in their wake. Other lawmakers, including Warren and Sen. Edward Markey (D-MA), also sent a letter to large AI companies, demanding answers about the working conditions of the human workers who help train and moderate AI models. US lawmakers have had a busy week talking about regulating AI. The day before the AI Insight Forum, the Senate’s Judiciary Committee held a hearing about AI legislation. Congress has held fairly regular hearings on various topics around AI regulation for months. The White House also got voluntary commitments from AI companies to develop AI responsibly.","output":"Technology leaders gathered for a private Senate meeting to discuss the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) in a balanced manner that promotes both innovation and safety.

The start of the brunette and redhead seires begin in their high school years, it was an unusual start as neither of them would have ever thought they would become each other's most hated rival, a rivalry which was being tested for one final time, a fight which only one of them would claim one over the other for one final time as the other would suffer death... 30 years ago... Class is in session inside of a small high school, a class which two girls are deemed the best looking in the class and to many the high school in general, they are Karen Pereira and Hilda Villalona. Karen Pereira, the shapely and white brunette latina of colombian heritage, she has a well chiseled shape face, large straight thin nosed, high cheekbones, hard angled eyebrows, brown eyes and wide lips. Hilda Villalona is also a fair skinned latina but she differs from Karen with her dark red hair and dominican heritage, she is white skinned but displays african roots with her full lips, small straight slightly thick nose and naturally cute, plump cheeks, green colored eyes and soft angle thin eyebrows. Both girls were gifted with lovely bodies as well, both of them had large breasts which many older woman would have love to have at their age, long and shapely legs and healthy looking skin. Both girls were incredibly attractive, and though some argued that Karen or Hilda were the prettiest girl in the school, it was mostly very much decided that Karen had the prettiest face while Hilda had the better body, but even that was argued by another. Hilda and Karen ackownledged each other and rather than rivaling and hating each other like they didn't know they would in the future, were friends and always seemed to be kind and friendly to everyone else. The two of them knew they were beautiful and did not care one bit of a rivalry. However, after their junior year begun, a new boy had arrived to school- His name was Bryan and when Hilda and Karen layed eyes on him they were in love with the new guy. They were attracted to this handsome stud, they became even more in love with him after knowing he was smart and came from a hard working family...","output":"and he seemed to show equal interest in both Hilda and Karen. This sparked the beginning of their rivalry. As the weeks went by, Hilda and Karen started competing for Bryan's attention. They would dress to impress, flaunting their best outfits and hairstyles. They would purposely sit next to him in class and engage in friendly banter, hoping to win him over. Things took a turn when Bryan asked Hilda to be his date to the homecoming dance. Karen, who was secretly hoping he would ask her, felt a pang of jealousy. She couldn't believe that Hilda had won this round. Not one to accept defeat easily, Karen decided to retaliate. She asked one of Bryan's close friends, Jake, to be her date for the dance. Karen knew that getting Jake's attention would surely make Bryan jealous and regret his decision. The night of the homecoming dance arrived, and tensions were high between Hilda and Karen. They exchanged icy glances and sarcastic compliments. It was clear that their friendship had turned into a bitter rivalry, with Bryan as the ultimate prize. Throughout the night, Karen tried her best to grab Bryan's attention. She danced and laughed with Jake, making sure that Bryan could see them from across the room. Hilda, on the other hand, remained calm and composed, not giving in to Karen's antics. As the evening drew to a close, Karen noticed that Bryan seemed unfazed by her actions. It was then that she realized Hilda had won. It wasn't about getting back at Bryan; it was about proving that she was the better woman. In the days that followed, Karen and Hilda's rivalry only intensified. They competed in academics, sports, and popularity. Every victory for one was a defeat for the other. They became known as the \\"bitter rivals\\" of the school, constantly pushing each other to their limits. Years passed, and even after high school, their rivalry continued. They both pursued successful careers, but always kept an eye on each other's achievements. The competition fueled them to work harder and achieve greater heights. It wasn't until their high school reunion, thirty years later, that they finally confronted each other. They realized that their rivalry had consumed their lives, holding them back from true happiness and fulfillment. In a surprising turn of events, Hilda and Karen decided to let go of their rivalry and embrace friendship. They realized that they had wasted so much time competing against each other, when they could have lifted each other up instead. From that day forward, Hilda and Karen became inseparable friends. They supported each other's dreams and celebrated each other's successes. They were proof that rivalry can turn into friendship, and that true happiness comes from lifting others up, rather than tearing them down."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Yet, seldom have they paid attention to false identities assumed in interactions like fraudulence. This study, by resorting to Chen’s (2018) theory on pragmatic identity, investigates 72 real fraud cases in contemporary China, trying to uncover the discursive practices for their fabricated identities and the underlying motivations for these identities. It is found that (i) fabricated identities like the victim identity, the friend/kin identity, the clerk identity, the official identity, and the identity of resourcefulness are often deployed as resources for fraudulent purposes; (ii) speech acts, person-referencing, discourse contents, codes, and sounds of speech are the common discursive practices con artists resort to in fabricating their identities; and (iii) the construction of the fabricated identities results from the con artists’ adaptation to the physical, social, and mental world of their targets. The study broadens the scope of identity construction by focusing on that of fabricated identity.1. Introduction The discursive turn on the research of identity in the 1990s has yielded a plethora of literature on the subject, mostly from psychology (e.g., Antaki & Widdicombe, 1998), sociology (e.g., Brewer & Gardner, 1996), and communication (e.g., Tracy, 2002). Researchers following the discursive turn believe identity is not fixed or pre-existing; rather, it is constructed in discourse interaction. Such a social constructionist perspective on identity is adopted in pragmatics as well. Pragmaticists have investigated both the types of and motivations behind identities constructed in social practices, such as workplace (e.g., Chiles, 2007; Holmes, 2006), email (e.g., Ho, 2010), medical consultation (e.g., Yuan & Chen, 2013), academic advising interaction (e.g., Ren, 2014), and online communication (e.g., Yuan, 2018), and how research on such construction contributes to the current pragmatic theory (e.g., Kong, 2003; Spencer-Oatey, 2007). Yet, their attention is mainly devoted to real identities assumed in the interaction; seldom have they studied fabricated identities like those in cases of fraud. In this research, we shall show that fabricated identities are often deployed as resources in fraudulent activities. Previous research on fraud has shown that con artists would employ various linguistic strategies to manipulate their targets (e.g., Eggington, 2008; Shuy, 2016). We intend to go further by linking the linguistic strategies with fabricated identities and probe into why different false identities are constructed. The theoretical framework we shall adopt is Chen’s (2018) theory on pragmatic identity, according to which identities temporarily constructed in situated communication may be deployed as resources for specific communicative purposes. This article consists of seven sections (Section 1 being this introduction): Section 2 gives an overview of the research background on fraud; Section 3 introduces Chen’s (2018) framework of pragmatic identity; Section 4 describes the process of data collection and analysis; Section 5 categorises the fabricated identities used in frauds into different types and analyses the linguistic realisations employed in the construction of each type; more cases are examined in Section 6 to illustrate contributive factors underlying the fabrication of the identities concerned; Section 7 concludes the whole study","output":"实用主义者已经调查了各种社会实践中的身份构建。然而，他们很少关注在互动中扮演的虚假身份，比如欺诈行为。本研究借鉴陈（2018）关于实用性身份的理论，调查了当代中国72起真实欺诈案件，试图揭示制造这些身份的话语实践以及背后的动机。研究发现：（i）欺诈行为中经常使用受害者身份、朋友/亲人身份、职员身份、官方身份和机智身份等制造的身份作为欺诈目的的资源；（ii）欺诈者在制造身份时常常运用言语行为、人称指代、话语内容、代码和言语声音等常见话语实践；（iii）制造假身份是欺诈者对目标的物质、社会和心理世界的适应。本研究通过关注制造身份的构建，拓宽了身份构建的范围。 1. 引言 20世纪90年代对身份研究进行的话语转向产生了大量的文献，其中大部分来自心理学（如Antaki＆Widdicombe，1998）、社会学（如Brewer＆Gardner，1996）和传播学（如Tracy，2002）。遵循话语转向的研究人员认为身份不是固定的或预先存在的，而是在话语互动中构建的。这种身份的社会构建主义视角在语用学中也被采纳。实用主义者已经调查了在职场（如Chiles，2007；Holmes，2006）、电子邮件（如Ho，2010）、医疗咨询（如Yuan＆Chen，2013）、学术指导互动（如Ren，2014）和在线交流（如Yuan，2018）等社会实践中构建的身份的类型和动机，以及这种研究如何对当前的语用理论做出贡献（如Kong，2003；Spencer-Oatey，2007）。然而，他们的注意力主要集中在互动中扮演的真实身份上，很少研究像欺诈案件中那样的伪造身份。 在这项研究中，我们将展示伪造身份在欺诈活动中经常被用作资源。以往的欺诈研究表明，骗子会使用各种语言策略操纵其目标（如Eggington，2008；Shuy，2016）。我们打算进一步将语言策略与伪造身份联系起来，并探究不同虚假身份的构建原因。我们将采用陈（2018）关于实用性身份的理论框架，根据该框架，在具体交际中暂时构建的身份可以用作特定的交际目的的资源。 本文共分为七个部分（第1部分为介绍）：第2部分概述了欺诈研究的背景；第3部分介绍了陈（2018）关于实用性身份的理论框架；第4部分描述了数据收集和分析的过程；第5部分将在欺诈中使用的伪造身份归类为不同类型，并分析了构建每种身份所采用的语言表现形式；第6部分进一步研究更多案例，以阐明构建相关身份的因素；第7部分总结了整个研究。"},{"instruction":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. 2.

El estudio de la metáfora se originó en la antigua retórica griega, y Aristóteles definió y elaboró por primera vez la metáfora de forma más sistemática en su Retórica y Poética, y su teoría de la metáfora, conocida generalmente como \\"teoría comparativa\\", dejó enormes influencias en la teoría metafórica en los dos mil años siguientes. Por tanto, la teoría de Aristóteles debe considerarse el inicio del estudio metafórico, tanto por su sistematicidad como por su influencia de largo alcance. En 1980, George Lykov y Mark Johnson señalaron que la metáfora no es sólo una cuestión de vocabulario en el lenguaje, sino también un importante medio del pensamiento humano, que interviene directamente en el proceso cognitivo de los seres humanos y es un estado fundamental de la existencia humana, y propusieron la primera teoría conceptual de la metáfora desde una perspectiva cognitiva. En su libro The Metaphors We Live By, Lykov y Johnson sugieren que \\"la metáfora no es meramente un fenómeno lingüístico, sino que tiene que ver con el pensamiento y la acción, y la naturaleza de la metáfora es la naturaleza del pensamiento; la similitud entre ontología y metáfora en la metáfora no es intrínseca a la naturaleza de las cosas, y la similitud está lejos de ser la teoría subyacente de la metáfora; la construcción de conceptos no puede hacerse sin la participación de la metáfora. \\"Aunque no existe una definición universalmente aceptada del concepto de metáfora, es fácil resumir algunas de sus características a base de la definición anterior: la metáfora no es sólo un fenómeno lingüístico, sino sobre todo una herramienta para el pensamiento, una actividad cognitiva en la que los seres humanos hacen una tranferencia de conpectos utilizando su experiencia en un dominio para ilustrar o comprender su experiencia en otro dominio.

The study of metaphor originated in ancient Greek rhetoric, and Aristotle first defined and developed metaphor in a more systematic way in his Rhetoric and Poetics. His theory of metaphor, generally known as \\"comparative theory,\\" had a huge influence on metaphorical theory in the following two thousand years. Therefore, Aristotle's theory should be considered the starting point of metaphorical study, both for its systematic nature and its far-reaching influence. In 1980, George Lykov and Mark Johnson pointed out that metaphor is not just a matter of vocabulary in language, but also an important means of human thought, which directly intervenes in the cognitive process of human beings and is a fundamental state of human existence. They proposed the first conceptual theory of metaphor from a cognitive perspective. In their book The Metaphors We Live By, Lykov and Johnson suggest that \\"metaphor is not merely a linguistic phenomenon, but is about thought and action, and the nature of metaphor is the nature of thought; the similarity between ontology and metaphor in metaphor is not intrinsic to the nature of things, and similarity is far from being the underlying theory of metaphor; the construction of concepts cannot be done without the participation of metaphor.\\" Although there is no universally accepted definition of the concept of metaphor, it is easy to summarize some of its characteristics based on the above definition: metaphor is not just a linguistic phenomenon, but primarily a tool for thought, a cognitive activity in which human beings transfer concepts using their experience in one domain to illustrate or understand their experience in another domain.

Linguists have amply examined the language of lying and deception. Many of them have attempted to find linguistic cues while lies are taking place. For instance, Knapp, Hart, and Dennis (1974) find that a deceiver has a tendency to use shortened messages, fewer factual declarations and more linguistic ambiguity and repeated double declarations, fewer group markers (‘we’, ‘our’, ‘all of us’) with more markers of diminishment (‘few’, ‘a little’, ‘hardly’), more markers of the other (‘they’), fewer personal declarations, and fewer self-references. Dulaney (1982) discovers through interviews that a liar uses fewer unique words with larger type-token ratios and smaller perceptual-cognitive activity measures, a smaller number of verbs in the past tense, and a faster speech rhythm. Steller and Koehnken (1989) find such common indicators of deception as claiming loss of memory, unusual and superfluous details, spontaneous corrections, and sudden complications regarding a relevant episode. Dilmon (2009) argues that, due to the uncontrollable cognitive and emotional processes, a fabricated narrative shows an overuse of collocations and idioms, many repetitions of details, and a larger-than-usual number of emotive words. Further studies also show a mixture of truths and lies in deceptive communication, such as concealing the lies within a discourse of truth and in non-deceptive contexts (Galasinski, 2000; Palena, Caso, & Vrij, 2019), or presenting partial truths or taking words out of their original context (Dilmon, 2009). A few studies are devoted to fraud cases. Shuy (2016) might be the first one to conduct a thorough investigation on the language of fraud. He examines a variety of fraud cases, such as government contract fraud, money laundering, etc., and assembles the speech events, schemas, agendas, speech acts, conversational strategies, and smaller language units of sentences, phrases, words, and sounds as linguistic evidence in each fraud case. Other studies focus on e-mail fraud in particular. Blommaert and Omoniyi (2006) point out that the genres of e-mail fraud are of two types: administrative-formal and narrative. The former resorts to technical and procedural registers and the latter seeks personal rapport and involvement in style. However, the grassroots level of literacy reflected in the emails points to obvious fraud. Following their research, Eggington (2008) examines one fraud email in detail to show how linguistic knowledge can detect deceptive language. Chiluwa (2009, 2010) conducts thick analysis on the linguistic features of the mails and reveals that the writers apply pragmatic strategies such as socio-cultural greeting formulas, self-identification, confidence building, narrativity, and action prompting strategies to sustain the interest of the receivers. The most frequent speech act is the representative act, the act of describing, stating, asserting, or claiming. Freiermuth (2011) notices that the scammer likes to pose as a refugee, a financial officer, a lottery official, or a company member offering a too-good-to-be-true job. He further analyses the rhetorical moves used and points out that all moves are meant to build solidarity with the mark and play to the mark’s egocentrism. Previous literature has shed some light on the discursive construction of lying, deception, and fraud. One study even touches upon the identity constructed in email fraud. The current research intends to go further in three respects. First, we try to link a host of linguistic devices with fabricated identities. We will argue that scammers’ deployment of language only works when the language is consistent with the fabricated identity. Second, we will account for the construction of different identities from the perspective of linguistic adaption, hence being able to subsume the wide range of discursive practice under one theoretical umbrella. Third, we will uncover fraud cases in the context of contemporary China involving a variety of occasions, in the hope of expanding the scope of fraud research.","output":"语言学家们广泛研究了说谎和欺骗的语言特征。他们中的许多人尝试找到说谎发生时的语言线索。例如，Knapp、Hart和Dennis（1974年）发现，说谎者有倾向使用简短的信息、较少的陈述事实和更多的语言模棱两可和重复的双重陈述，较少的群体标记词（如“我们”、“我们的”、“我们所有人”），而更多的减少标记词（如“少许”、“一点”、“几乎没有”），更多关于他人的标记（如“他们”），较少个人陈述和较少自我参照。Dulaney（1982年）通过采访发现，说谎者使用较少的独特词汇、较大的类型-标记比和较小的感知认知活动测量值，过去时动词较少，说话节奏较快。Steller和Koehnken（1989年）发现了欺骗的常见指标，如声称记忆丧失、不寻常和多余的细节、自发纠正以及与相关事件相关的突然复杂化。Dilmon（2009年）认为，由于无法控制的认知和情感过程，虚构的叙述会过度使用搭配和习语，许多细节的重复，并且使用比平常更多的情感词语。进一步研究还表明，在欺骗性交流中有真实和谎言混合存在，例如在真实的话语中隐藏谎言，在非欺骗性上下文中（Galasinski,2000;Palena,Caso, & Vrij,2019）或者呈现部分真相或将词语脱离原本语境（Dilmon,2009）。 有几项研究专门研究了欺诈案件。Shuy（2016年）可能是第一个对欺诈语言进行深入调查的人。他研究了各种欺诈案件，如政府合同欺诈、洗钱等，并将每个欺诈案件中的言语事件、模式、议程、言语行为、对话策略以及句子、短语、词语和声音作为语言证据。其他研究则专注于电子邮件欺诈。Blommaert和Omoniyi（2006年）指出，电子邮件欺诈的文体有两种类型：行政正式和叙事性。前者采用技术和程序性登记，而后者则寻求个人的亲近和参与。然而，电子邮件中反映的基层读写能力明显存在欺诈。继续他们的研究，Eggington（2008年）详细研究了一封欺诈电子邮件，展示了语言知识如何识别欺诈语言。Chiluwa（2009年，2010年）对电子邮件的语言特征进行了深入分析，揭示了作者运用社会文化问候公式、自我识别、增加信心、叙事性和行动促使策略来保持接收者的兴趣。最频繁的言语行为是代表性行为，即描述、陈述、断言或主张的行为。Freiermuth（2011年）注意到欺诈者喜欢冒充难民、财务主管、彩票官员或公司成员以提供一个太美好以至于让人难以置信的工作。他进一步分析了所使用的修辞手法，并指出所有的手法都旨在与受害者建立团结，并迎合受害者的利己主义。 先前的研究已经在讨论说谎、欺骗和欺诈的话语构建方面提供了一些启示。有一项研究甚至触及了电子邮件欺诈中形成的身份认同。本研究意在从三个方面进一步探讨。首先，我们试图将大量的语言手段与虚构的身份联系起来。我们将论证，骗子只有在语言与虚构的身份一致时才能发挥其作用。其次，我们将从语言适应的角度解释不同身份的构建，从而能够将各种话语实践纳入一个理论框架中。第三，我们将揭示与当代中国的各种场合有关的欺诈案件，希望扩大欺诈研究的范围。"},{"instruction":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. 3.

En su manuscrito, Hsi P'êng pasó trece años construyendo un \\"laberinto\\" en su afán por escribir una novela más ambiciosa y distinguida que Sueño de la cámara roja, por lo que utilizó el \\"tiempo\\" como enigma y el espacio infinito como acertijo para agotar todas las posibilidades de la trama del cuento. Más allá del manuscrito de El jardín están los testimonios de Yu Tsun tras su detención, en los que se demuestra que estuvo en una misión de espionaje para \\"transmitir información militar\\", al tiempo que se encontraba con el \\"laberinto del tiempo\\" expresado en El jardín. En esta narración, Borges utiliza cinco \\"construcciones cósmicas\\" para visualizar el \\"tiempo\\": (1) el niño revela que Yu Tsun busca a Albert; (2) el niño le dice a Yu Tsun que gire a la izquierda en cada intersección; (3) Albert sabe que Yu Tsun quiere visitar la casa de Hsi P'êng (3) Albert sabe que Yu Tsun quiere visitar el \\"jardín\\" de Hsi P'êng; (4) Yu Tsun dispara a Albert; (5) Yu Tsun lee sobre el asesinato de Albert y el bombardeo de la ciudad de \\"Albert\\" en el mismo periódico. La razón por la que decimos que la trama fuera del manuscrito de \\"El jardín\\" también sigue el patrón del \\"laberinto temporal\\" es que, aunque los cinco episodios anteriores ocurren en \\"orden\\" cronológico en el cuento, podemos ver claramente muchos indicios de disposición temporal no lineal. En (1) y (3), el niño y Albert están claramente informados de las intenciones de Yu Tsun, porque en otros espacios Yu Tsun ha realizado numerosas elecciones y acciones posibles, y por tanto repite sus interacciones con ellas. En (4), tras saber que Albert puede ser enemigo, amigo o irrelevante de él mismo, no duda en disparar al amigo simpático que acaba de conocer; En (5), los dos sucesos no pueden haber sido publicadas en el mismo periódico, porque solo con la información de que el destino del bombardeo es la ciudad Albert se podría echarlo acertadamente, pero Yu Tsun los lee en el mismo periódico... Estos dos sucesos juntos demuestran que en este espacio infinito puede encontrar en más ocasiones a Yu Tsun y que son estas \\"construcciones cósmicas\\" fragmentarias, una tras otra, las manifestaciones secundarias del espacio infinito. Son también estas \\"construcciones cósmicas\\" fragmentarias las que permiten que el \\"laberinto del tiempo\\" de Borges escape de los conceptos metafísicos y se haga tangible. En un mundo tridimensional, el acto de girar a la izquierda en cada intersección implica un \\"ciclo\\", una \\"reencarnación\\"[ Justo como una persona anda por un círculo que supone una circulación, o sea una reencarnación en varias culturas.], pero en el \\"laberinto del tiempo\\", esto demuestra que, en el universo \\"jardín\\", el espacio es infinitamente extendible.","output":"\\"El jardín de senteros que se bifurcan\\": an interpretation of space-time perspectives Firstly, it must be clear that \\"El jardín de senteros que se bifurcan\\" is a \\"meta-novel,\\" meaning that the story itself describes the novel it is part of. In his manuscript, Hsi P'êng spent thirteen years constructing a \\"maze\\" in his desire to write a more ambitious and distinguished novel than Dream of the Red Chamber, using \\"time\\" as an enigma and infinite space as a puzzle to exhaust all possibilities of the story's plot. Beyond the manuscript of El jardín are the testimonies of Yu Tsun after his arrest, which demonstrate that he was on a spying mission to \\"transmit military information,\\" while also encountering the \\"maze of time\\" expressed in The Garden. In this narrative, Borges uses five \\"cosmic constructions\\" to visualize \\"time\\": (1) the child reveals that Yu Tsun is searching for Albert; (2) the child tells Yu Tsun to turn left at every intersection; (3) Albert knows Yu Tsun wants to visit Hsi P'êng's house; (4) Yu Tsun shoots Albert; (5) Yu Tsun reads about Albert's murder and the bombing of the city of \\"Albert\\" in the same newspaper. The reason we say that the plot outside the manuscript of \\"El jardín\\" also follows the pattern of the \\"temporal maze\\" is that, although the five episodes above occur in chronological \\"order\\" in the story, we can clearly see many indications of non-linear temporal arrangement. In (1) and (3), the child and Albert are clearly informed of Yu Tsun's intentions because in other spaces Yu Tsun has made numerous possible choices and actions, and thus he repeats his interactions with them. In (4), after realizing that Albert can be an enemy, friend, or irrelevant to himself, Yu Tsun does not hesitate to shoot the friendly acquaintance he has just met. In (5), the two events cannot have been published in the same newspaper, as only with the information that the target of the bombing is the city of Albert could Yu Tsun correctly identify it, but he reads both events in the same newspaper... These two events together demonstrate that in this infinite space, Yu Tsun can encounter himself on multiple occasions, and these fragmentary \\"cosmic constructions\\" are the secondary manifestations of infinite space. These fragmentary \\"cosmic constructions\\" also allow Borges' \\"maze of time\\" to escape metaphysical concepts and become tangible. In a three-dimensional world, the act of turning left at every intersection implies a \\"cycle,\\" a \\"reincarnation\\" [Just as a person walks in a circle, which suggests circulation or reincarnation in various cultures.], but in the \\"maze of time,\\" this demonstrates that, in the \\"garden\\" universe, space is infinitely extendable."},{"instruction":"Check the following text for any grammar errors and advise on imrovement Role of tumor-associated fibroblasts in the proliferation, invasion, and treatment of thyroid carcinoma (1. Laboratory of Human Diseases and Immunotherapies, West China Hospital, Sichuan University; 2. Rehabilitation Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University) 【Abstract】Thyroid carcinoma is one of the most common endocrine malignancies. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are important cellular components in the tumor microenvironment of thyroid carcinoma, with heterogeneities in their cell origins, phenotypes, and functions. CAFs promotes tumor progression though its interactions with tumor cells. CAFs can directly or indirectly promote the development and progression of thyroid carcinoma by altering the structure and function of the extracellular matrix, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and enhancing cytokine secretion and release. Based on the characteristics of CAFs in thyroid carcinoma, some possible treatment strategies have been proposed. This article reviews the research advances in CAFs and thyroid carcinoma progression based on relevant literature. A clinical analysis of 158 children with ovarian cysts (Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Genetics, and Metabolism, The Affiliated Women’s and Children’s Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China • Chengdu Women’s and Children’s Central Hospital) 【Abstract】Objective: To improve clinicians’ knowledge of ovarian cysts in children by analyzing the clinical data of 158 children with ovarian cysts. Methods: The clinical data of 158 children with ovarian cysts admitted to the outpatient department of Chengdu Women’s and Children’s Central Hospital from September 2019 to September 2022 were collected and divided into 3 groups according to age (0-1 year, 1-8 years, and 8-16 years). The clinical characteristics of these patients were summarized and analyzed. Results: Most neonatal and infant ovarian cysts were identified incidentally. Most of clinical symptoms, including breast development (81.3%) and vaginal bleeding (25.0%), were found in girls aged 1-8 years. Irregular menstruation (45.6%) and abdominal pain (33.3%) were the most common symptoms in girls aged over 8 years. The vast majority of the patients were diagnosed with simple ovarian cysts, but six patients were found to have ovarian tumors. Ovarian torsion was found in 7 cases. Most of the ovarian cysts were spontaneously remittable during the follow-up, but some recurred in the children. Central precocious puberty was observed in two children during the follow-up. The rate of surgical intervention was 8.9%. Conclusion: For most of the girls, no intervention is needed due to their diagnosis with simple cysts; however, some of them may have underlying disease causes or complications such as ovarian tumors, McCune-Albright syndrome, Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome, central precocious puberty, and ovarian torsion. Hence these patients should be evaluated carefully and treated with multidisciplinary approaches.","output":"Role of tumor-associated fibroblasts in the proliferation, invasion, and treatment of thyroid carcinoma (1.

Economic and political instability: Germany was severely affected by the economic consequences of World War I, including hyperinflation, high unemployment rates, and a struggling economy. These circumstances created a fertile ground for Hitler's promise of economic stability and a strong German nation. 2. Treaty of Versailles: The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended World War I, imposed harsh reparations on Germany, leading to national humiliation and a sense of injustice among the people. Hitler effectively exploited these sentiments, promising to overturn the treaty and restore Germany's former glory. 3. Weaknesses of the Weimar Republic: The Weimar Republic, established in 1919, was the democratic government that replaced the German empire after its defeat in World War I. However, it faced numerous challenges, including a weak political system, frequent changes in government, social unrest, and extremist uprisings from both the left and the right. Hitler portrayed himself as a strong leader who would restore order and stability, exploiting the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic. 4. Propaganda and charismatic leadership: Hitler and the Nazi Party effectively used propaganda, mass rallies, and the media to promote their ideology, gain popularity, and gain support across different segments of society. Hitler's charismatic speaking skills, combined with media manipulation, enabled him to appeal to the masses and convince them of his vision for Germany. 5. Fear of communism: Following the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the rise of communist movements across Europe, there was a widespread fear of communism in Germany. Hitler capitalized on this fear, presenting his National Socialist Party as a bulwark against communism, gaining support from individuals seeking to prevent a communist takeover. 6. Lack of strong opposition: The traditional conservative elites, who often controlled key institutions such as the military, bureaucracy, and judiciary, initially underestimated Hitler and believed they could control him if he came to power. They often preferred Hitler and the Nazis to the perceived threat of communism and failed to mount a united front against the Nazi Party. It is important to note that while Hitler's rise to power was not widely challenged initially, there were still individuals, groups, and political parties who opposed him. However, a combination of these socio-political conditions, propaganda, and strategic maneuvering enabled Hitler and the Nazis to gain significant support and eventually assume complete control of Germany."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello! How can I assist you?"},{"instruction":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. Pragmatic identity can be divided into personal identity (such as gender, ethnicity, age, national or regional origin, image), interactional identity (such as friend, co-worker, peer, enemy), and situational identity (such as organiser, guest). These identities, which could be pre-existing or non-existing before an interaction, are temporarily activated or fabricated as required by the specific purpose of that interaction. As will be seen in this analysis of the fraud cases below, con artists dynamically construct for themselves different personal, interactional, and situational identities for the purpose of the fraud they have decided to commit. Furthermore, con artists tend to exploit their pre-existing personal identity and build up the intended image. For example, the victim identity we will be discussing is usually constructed by those who are female, weak, or handicapped, the kinds of personal attributes that are pre-existing and difficult to change in a conversation. Considering how these identities are constructed through language in interaction, Chen (2018, pp. 38–39), following Tracy (2002), suggests a reciprocal relationship between identities and discursive practices. That is, the identities a person brings to an interaction influence how that person communicates; at the same time, the specific discursive practices a person chooses will shape who s/he is taken to be. Specifically, a person will adopt discursive practices at the macro level, such as codes, styles, discourse structures, contents and manners, and practices at the micro level, such as speech acts, person-referencing, grammar, lexicons, sounds of speech and paralanguage to construct identities in communication. Table 1 offers a detailed description of these discursive practices. Table 1: Types of discursive practices for identity construction (based on Chen, 2018, pp. 38–39","output":"实用的身份可以分为个人身份（如性别、种族、年龄、国籍或地域来源、形象）、互动身份（如朋友、同事、同伴、敌人）和情境身份（如组织者、客人）。这些身份可能在互动之前存在或不存在，根据特定互动目的的要求而临时激活或制造。正如下面对欺诈案件的分析所显示的，骗子为了实施欺诈行为通常会动态地构建不同的个人身份、互动身份和情境身份。此外，骗子倾向于利用他们已有的个人身份，并建立预期的形象。例如，我们将讨论的受害者身份通常是由女性、弱者或残障人士构建的，这些个人特征在对话中是已有的且很难改变的。考虑到这些身份是如何通过语言在互动中构建的，陈（2018年，第38-39页）在追随特雷西（2002年）的基础上提出了身份与话语实践之间的相互关系。也就是说，一个人带入互动的身份会影响他/她的交流方式；同时，一个人选择的特定话语实践将塑造他/她被认定为何种身份。具体而言，一个人会通过宏观层面的话语实践（如编码、风格、话语结构、内容和方式）和微观层面的实践（如言语行为、人称、语法、词汇、语音和身体语言）来构建沟通中的身份。表1详细描述了这些话语实践。 表1：身份构建的话语实践类型（基于陈，2018年，第38-39页）"},{"instruction":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. Being a general framework for analysis, Chen’s categorisation in Table 1 allows for specific match-ups between one or more discursive practices and a particular identity. For example, a policeman may use interrogation whereas a kindergarten teacher may resort to baby talk. However, this does not suggest a one-to-one correspondence between a discursive practice and an identity. The same discursive practice may be a means to construct different identities, and the same identity may be constructed via different discursive practices. For instance, an honorific ‘you’ (nin 您) in Chinese is found (for details see below) to help construct the situ￾ational identity of a commercial institution, a polite personal identity as well as an interactional identity of subordination on the part of the speaker. Also building on Verschueren’s (1999) notion of adaptation, Chen (2018) recognises the dynamicity of the pragmatic identity that communicators may assume in conversation. The speaker consciously or unconsciously chooses to construct a certain identity due to a set of contextual correlates. In this study, we will argue that a particular identity is deliberately constructed by a particular con artist in a particular fraud, out of the speaker’s need to adapt to factors in the physical, social, and mental world of the discourse, as will be demonstrated in Section 6. 4. Methodology The research is guided by the following three questions: 1. What are the identities fabricated by con artists in China? 2. How are these identities discursively constructed? 3. Why do con artists choose to fabricate these identities? To answer these questions, this study selected 72 real fraud cases from a China Central Television (CCTV) programme called Legal Report and online news reports. Legal Report is a popular TV programme reporting real law cases in China. We searched the video clips of this programme available online (2006– 2010, 2017–2018) and the results yielded 22 episodes concerning fraudulent activities. In these episodes, the host unveiled each case by inserting extracts of recollections from victims/targets and con artists. Afterwards, experts in law and sociology gave their comments in order to shed light on the reasons behind these cases. Since the data were limited, we expanded our search to online news reports. We typed “fraud case” in the search engine Baidu (a popular search engine in China) and randomly selected 50 relevant pieces. In each piece, the reporter told the story and quoted words of the victims and con artists. The recollections and quotations referred to dialogues the victims and con artists had had; they also revealed the con artists’ admission of their reasons for choosing certain groups of targets as well as the victims’ accounts of their being tricked into being victimised. Thus, our analysis could benefit largely from the perspective of insiders.","output":"作为分析的一般框架，陈在表1中的分类允许一个或多个话语实践与特定身份之间进行具体的匹配。例如，警察可能使用审讯，而幼儿园教师可能会使用婴儿语。然而，这并不意味着话语实践和身份之间的一对一对应关系。同样的话语实践可能是构建不同身份的手段，同样的身份也可能通过不同的话语实践来构建。例如，中国的敬语“您”在商业机构中被发现（详见下文）有助于构建情境身份、礼貌的个人身份以及发言者的从属性互动身份。 此外，陈（2018）在Verschueren（1999）关于适应的概念基础上，认识到沟通者在交流中可能扮演的实用身份是动态的。发言者有意识或无意识地选择构建某种特定的身份，这是由一系列语境相关因素决定的。在本研究中，我们将论证，特定的身份是特定的骗子在特定的欺诈行为中有意构建的，以适应言语世界的物理、社会和精神环境因素，这将在第6节中进行论证。 4. 方法论 本研究的指导性问题有以下三个： 1. 骗子在中国制造了哪些身份？ 2. 这些身份是通过何种话语方式构建的？ 3. 为什么骗子选择制造这些身份？ 为了回答这些问题，本研究从中央电视台的《法律访谈》节目和在线新闻报道中选取了72个真实的欺诈案例。《法律访谈》是一档报道中国真实法律案件的热门电视节目。我们在网上搜索了该节目的视频片段（2006年至2010年，2017年至2018年），结果得到了22集涉及欺诈活动的片段。在这些片段中，主持人通过插入受害者/目标和骗子回忆的摘录来揭示每个案例。随后，法律和社会学专家发表评论，以揭示这些案件背后的原因。 由于数据有限，我们扩大了在线新闻报道的搜索范围。我们在中国的百度（一个热门的搜索引擎）中键入“欺诈案件”，并随机选择了50篇相关文章。在每篇文章中，记者讲述故事并引用受害者和骗子的话语。这些回忆和引用涉及到受害者和骗子之间的对话，也揭示了骗子选择特定目标群体的原因以及受害者被骗的经历。因此，我们的分析可以从内部人员的视角中获得很大的收益。"},{"instruction":"Translate to Middle Japanese \\"Madeleine jumped onto the chair and shouted, “Please behave properly!

I tried to publish valuable content within the fields I was familiar with, such as design. In 2018, as a first-year master’s student at Renmin University of China, I participated in an art exhibition called “Butterfly Theory,” which was planned by my advisor and open to the public for free. After completing the design and production of the exhibition pieces, I took on the responsibility of promoting the exhibition. Due to a limited budget for promotion, I wrote a promotional article about the exhibition myself and carefully selected a cover image (a beautiful picture of my exhibit) to be published on Xiaohongshu (a popular social media platform). The article gained popularity within the first two days. On the first day of the exhibition, a fellow student from Renmin University came to visit. When I was guiding visitors at the entrance, she mentioned that she had discovered the exhibition through the trending recommendations on Xiaohongshu and decided to come and support after realizing it was located at our university. After her visit, she expressed admiration for the high quality of the exhibition. During our conversation, I found out that she was a heavy user of Xiaohongshu and actively shared her own notes on the platform. I provided her with detailed information about the exhibition and encouraged her to promote it on Xiaohongshu as well. That day, she published a note about the exhibition from a public perspective, including the exhibition tour and her post-exhibition experience exploring the campus canteen at Renmin University. She also mentioned me in the article to help promote it. Her post gained even more popularity. Our joint efforts successfully generated strong pre-exhibition hype and attracted some Xiaohongshu influencers to visit and post about the exhibition for free, further enhancing its popularity. The exhibition received a visitation count of 3,562 people. In 2019, I was awarded a scholarship to study abroad for one semester at the University of Lapland in Finland. Through taking design courses and interacting with local Finnish students, I learned about many renowned Finnish design brands and their products. Prior to coming to Finland, when I browsed through Xiaohongshu and other similar platforms, the recommendations were primarily focused on where to buy LV products at the best prices in Finland. I couldn’t find a comprehensive collection of information on valuable design products available for purchase in Finland within China.

With 72 real fraud cases at hand, we first classified the fabricated identities into five types on the basis of the discursive practices used by the con artists. Then we categorised the discursive practices used in fraud cases according to Chen’s (2018) framework and calculated the percentage of each discursive practice by dividing its number of occurrences by the total cases of fraud (i.e. 72). Afterwards, we further categorised each discursive practice according to its manifestations and calculated their percentages by dividing their number of occurrences by the total cases of fraud (i.e. 72). Note that a category may have several manifestations. For instance, a con artist may use both a polite form such as nin (honorific ‘you’) and an intimate term of address such as dajie (‘big sister’); in this case, we would￾count one occurrence for the category ‘polite term’ and another one occurrence for the category ‘intimate term’. For the details about the percentage of each type of discursive practice as well as those of its manifestations, refer to Table 2 (shown in Section 5.1). After the quantitative analysis, we chose one example from each identity cat￾egory and studied the reciprocal relationship between language and identity, based on the framework by Chen (2018). These five cases were picked out because the fraud language in each can be reconstructed to the fullest degree, so that we can present a clear and comprehensible analysis in the study. Of the five examples, Case (3) shows how a con artist failed in his attempt. It was deliberately singled out to display mismatch between identities and discursive practices. In the analysis, we reconstructed the communications between the con art￾ists and their targets with background information. We quoted whatever they recalled had been said between them and arranged their utterances according to the time sequence. The background information provided within brackets was extracted from the narration. Though these dialogues may not be exactly the same as what actually occurred, they are close enough to reality to warrant our analysis. In addition, ten more cases, together with the previous five, were shown to explicate the mechanism behind the deceptive identity construction. A table of details was given on what con artists’ fabricated identities were, where they con￾tacted the targets, and what excuses they used for their frauds. The above-men￾tioned recollections, comments and quotations were used to support our argu￾ment. 5. Types of fabricated identities and their discursive practices This section reports the findings that have emerged from our data examination. 5.1 General findings By examining the data, we discovered five types of identities con artists often fabricated. They were: (i) ‘victim’, which could evoke sympathy (e.g. a woman whose wallet was stolen; a pregnant woman who was hit by a car); (ii) ‘friend/ kin’, which could attract one’s affection (e.g. son, old friend, man seeking a part￾ner); (iii) ‘clerk’, which provides business services to the public (e.g. operators in telecom institutions); (iv) ‘official’, which presumes authority and accountability (e.g. officials in a judicial department, a police officer); and (v) ‘resourceful person’, which presumes high status financially or spiritually (e.g. the brother of a board chairman, a person with a degree in higher education from a developed country, a master of Buddhism, the daughter of a real-estate shareholder). The results partly echo Freiermuth’s (2011) study on fraud email, in which he notices that the scammer’s commonly projected identities are as a refugee, a financial officer, a lottery official, and a company member offering a too-good-to-be-true job. A refugee belongs to the victim category, and the other three belong to the resourceful person category. Since the current study examines various types of frauds, it is able to identify more specific identity categories.","output":"有72起真实的欺诈案例，我们首先根据骗子使用的论述实践将编造的身份分为五种类型。然后，我们根据陈（2018）的框架对欺诈案件中使用的论述实践进行分类，并通过将其出现次数除以欺诈总案例数（即72）来计算每种论述实践的百分比。随后，我们根据论述实践的表现进行进一步分类，并通过将其出现次数除以欺诈总案例数（即72）来计算它们的百分比。注意，一个类别可能有多种表现形式。例如，骗子可能既使用礼貌的说法，如\\"honorific 'you'\\"，也使用亲密的称呼，如\\"big sister\\"；在这种情况下，我们将为\\"polite term\\"类别计算一次出现，并为\\"intimate term\\"类别计算一次出现。有关每种论述实践及其表现形式百分比的详细信息，请参见表2（第5.1节中显示）。 在量化分析之后，我们从每个身份类别中选择一个例子，根据陈（2018）的框架研究了语言和身份之间的相互关系。选择这五个案例是因为每个案例中的欺诈语言可以得到最充分的重构，因此我们可以给出清晰易懂的分析。在这五个例子中，案例（3）展示了一个骗子失败的尝试。这个案例被特意挑选出来，以显示身份和论述实践之间的不匹配。 在分析中，我们通过背景信息重构了骗子和受害者之间的交流。我们引用了他们之间互相回忆起的话语，并按照时间顺序进行了整理。方括号内提供的背景信息是从叙述中提取出来的。虽然这些对话可能不完全与实际发生的情况相同，但足够接近现实，足以支持我们的分析。 此外，除了之前的五个案例外，我们还展示了另外十个案例，以阐明欺诈身份建构背后的机制。我们提供了一个详细表格，列出了骗子编造的身份、他们与目标联系的地点以及他们用于诈骗的借口。上述的回忆、评论和引文被用来支持我们的论点。 5. 编造身份及其论述实践的类型 本节报告了我们的数据研究所得出的结果。 5.1 总体发现 通过对数据的研究，我们发现骗子经常编造五种类型的身份。它们是：（i）“受害者”，可以引起同情（例如，钱包被偷的妇女；被车撞的孕妇）；（ii）“朋友/亲属”，可以吸引人的好感（例如，儿子、老朋友、寻找伴侣的男人）；（iii）“职员”，向公众提供商业服务（例如，电信机构的运营商）；（iv）“官方人员”，假定拥有权威和责任（例如，司法部门的官员、警察）；以及（v）“有能力的人”，假定在财务或精神上具有高地位（例如，董事会主席的兄弟、来自发达国家高等教育学位的人、佛教大师、房地产股东的女儿）。这些结果在一定程度上与弗雷莫斯（2011）关于欺诈电子邮件的研究相吻合，他注意到骗子常常假扮成难民、财务官员、彩票官员和提供好得难以置信的工作机会的公司成员。难民属于受害者类别，其他三种属于有能力的人类别。由于本研究考察了各种类型的欺诈，因此能够确定更具体的身份类别。"},{"instruction":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. As to the discursive construction, Table 2 lists the most frequent types of discursive practice and the top three manifestations in each case. It is noticed that con artists tend to resort to speech acts, person-referencing, discourse contents, codes, and sounds of speech to fabricate an identity. Similar to Chiluwa’s (2010) finding, representatives are the most frequent type of speech act. This is natural, since the information has to be directly conveyed to the target. Commissives follow as the con artists usually promise high profit. The frequent use of polite forms of address for others, together with professional terms for self, helps take the target off guard. Discourse contents are what largely contribute to the identity fabrication as well. Con artists are likely to provide many details (sometimes too many, as will be shown in Case (3)) and a plausible number in order to convince the targets of their fabricated identity. Sometimes, the information is a combination of truth and lies, so that it is difficult for the target to spot the fraud. This is consistent with the findings of previous research that liars tend to conceal lies in truth or present partial truth (Dilmon, 2009; Galasinski, 2000; Palena et al., 2019).","output":"关于话语建构，表2列出了最常见的话语实践类型以及每种情况中的前三种表现形式。注意到，骗子倾向于使用言语行为、人称指称、话语内容、代码和说话声音来编造身份。与Chiluwa（2010）的发现类似，代理行为是最常见的言语行为类型。这是很自然的，因为信息必须直接传达给目标。接着是承诺行为，因为骗子通常承诺高额利润。对他人使用礼貌的称呼，以及对自己使用专业术语，帮助使目标措手不及。 话语内容在身份编造中起着很大的贡献。骗子往往会提供很多细节（有时太多了，如案例（3）所示），并给出一个似乎可信的数字，以便说服目标相信他们虚构的身份。有时，信息是真实与谎言的结合，使目标难以发现欺诈。这与先前研究的发现一致，即撒谎者倾向于将谎言隐藏在真实之中或呈现部分真相（Dilmon，2009；Galasinski，2000；Palena等，2019）。"},{"instruction":"( there's a seminar 3 day in our village about skills training and my daughter is second grade student her all classmen's and there parent has been add it in the list for going to seminar but the did not my name was not in the list and i think the provide some money also for the parent of students also , could plaese pay attention to this matter) Correct it grammatically","output":"There is a three-day seminar in our village about skills training, and my daughter is a second-grade student.

The types of codes used are also important means for the con artists to construct fabricated identities. A majority of con artists in the fraud cases choose to use Mandarin, as it presents the image of a well-educated person, who is supposed to have high credibility. Almost one third of them employ jargon to seem more professional. In a few cases, dialect is used to bridge the psychological distance with the strangers. To a lesser extent, sounds of speech, especially mysterious tones, help in the construction of false identities. As is stated in Eggington’s (2008) research, the target sometimes would be urged to be confidential, “adding a secretive and conspirational facet to the relationship”. Table 2 has given a general picture of the discursive practices used in fraud cases. In order to display the complexity in identity fabrication, five stories as typical cases for the above five identities and their corresponding discursive practices are discussed in detail below. Table 2: Discursive practices of 72 fraud cases 5.2 Case studies 5.2.1 The identity ‘polite female victim’ The identity of victim is constructed by the con artist’s pretending to be someone who has been harmed by a crime and then takes advantage of the target’s sympa￾Table 2: Discursive practices of 72 fraud cases Discursive practices Percentage Manifestations Percentage *Other practices like grammar and paralanguage occupy 5.56% among the cases.

This personal identity is usually fabricated by women, children, the old, or the handicapped, because they are supposed to be easy prey for criminals. A representative example of this type of identity fabrication is Case (1) below. Case (1) Context: Near Yulin Bus Station, a fashionable woman A approaches Mr B . In Case (1), the con artist A pretends to be a polite female victim of a pickpocket in order to gain B’s sympathy. As is mentioned above, her pre-existing personal identity as a woman serves as the basis for her fabrication. Still, various kinds of linguistic devices are employed to enhance the construction of the identity as a female victim. Two such devices are the code and the sounds of speech: standard Mandarin with an anxious tone. Generally, standard Mandarin speakers are seen as being educated and cultivated. Accordingly, when a woman speaks standard Mandarin, she leaves at least an inoffensive impression. An anxious tone, in addi￾tion, projects a woman in need. Furthermore, the con artist starts the conver￾sation by making an apology ‘Excuse me … sorry to bother you’ before asking constructing false identities for fraudulent purposes 109 for help so as to mitigate the face-threatening force inherent in the speech act of requests (Brown & Levinson, 1987). Getting a ‘go ahead’ (indicated by the utterance ‘Yes?’) from B, she modifies her request act with polite address forms xiansheng 先生 ‘sir’ and nin1 您 ‘you’ (honorific) and politeness markers mafan nin 麻烦您 ‘Would you (honorific) mind’ and qing 请 ‘please’, perfecting the refined and educated personal identity. Meanwhile, the information she provides is consistent, as what she needs is a ‘return ticket’ rather than a ‘departure ticket’, leaving her no choice but to seek help. Finally, her promise of paying back the money is meant to reinforce her sincerity. All these discursive practices are woven together to fabricate the identity of a polite female victim.","output":"这些码的类型也是骗子们构建虚假身份的重要手段。在诈骗案中，大多数骗子选择使用普通话，因为它给人一种受过良好教育、可信度较高的形象。其中约三分之一的骗子使用行业术语来表现更专业。在少数情况下，方言被用来拉近与陌生人之间的心理距离。声音，特别是神秘的语调，在构建虚假身份中起到一定的帮助。正如Eggington在其2008年的研究中所述，目标有时会被敦促保密，“为关系增添了神秘和密谋的特点”。 表2给出了在诈骗案中使用的话语实践的整体情况。为了展示虚假身份制造的复杂性，下面详细讨论了五个典型案例，即上述五种身份及其相应的话语实践。表2：72起诈骗案的话语实践。5.2案例研究 5.2.1身份：“有礼貌的女性受害者” 骗子通过假装自己是一名受害者，声称自己遭受了犯罪的伤害，然后利用目标的同情心骗取钱财来构建受害者的身份。这种个人身份通常由女性、儿童、老人或残疾人伪造，因为他们被认为是犯罪分子的易捕食对象。下面是这种类型身份伪造的一个典型案例。 案例（1）背景：在榆林汽车站附近，一名时尚女子A接近B先生。在案例（1）中，骗子A假装是一名有礼貌的女性受害者，声称自己被扒窃，以获取B的同情。正如上面提到的，她作为一个女性的现有个人身份成了她伪造身份的基础。然而，为了增强她作为女性受害者的身份建构，采用了各种语言手段。其中两种设备是代码和语音：带有焦虑口吻的标准普通话。一般来说，标准普通话的说话者被视为受过教育和有修养。因此，当一名女性讲标准普通话时，至少会给人一种不冒犯的印象。此外，焦虑的语调还展示了一个需要帮助的女性形象。另外，骗子在开始对话之前向B道歉：“打扰一下，非常抱歉”，然后才请求帮助，以减轻请求行为本身所带来的攻击性（Brown和Levinson，1987）。在得到B的“同意”（通过他的发言“嗯？”）之后，她以礼貌的称呼形式和礼貌标记，如先生和您（尊敬称），以及麻烦您和请（尊敬称）等礼貌用语修饰请求事务，完善她精致而有教养的个人身份。同时，她提供的信息是一致的，因为她需要的是一张“返程票”，而不是一张“出发票”，只能寻求帮助。最后，她承诺偿还钱款以加强她的诚意。所有这些话语实践被编织在一起，伪造了一个有礼貌的女性受害者的身份。"},{"instruction":"请将如下内容，在不改变大意的情况下，压缩至75个单词：These two notes I mentioned above received over 30,000 reads.

Charcoal masks can help to improve the overall appearance of the skin by unclogging pores, reducing the look of blackheads, and promoting a clearer complexion. They are suitable for various skin types but may be particularly beneficial for oily and acne-prone skin. Charcoal masks are typically applied to the face in a thin layer, left to dry or harden, and then peeled off or rinsed away to reveal smoother, rejuvenated skin. It is important to follow the instructions on the specific product and perform a patch test before using any new skincare product."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Con artists using this situational type constructing false identities for fraudulent purposes 111 usually defraud people by pretending that they provide services, as exemplified in Case (3). Case (3) Context: A middle-aged-sounding man E calls Mr F on the telephone . Unlike the previous cases, the con artist E directly declares himself as an official clerk at Telecom. To help strengthen the impression of his identity construction, he uses standard Mandarin, polite language such as nin hao 您好 ‘hello’ and the honorific nin 您 ‘you’ and technical jargons such as touzhi 透支 ‘deficit’ and tingji 停机 ‘disconnect’. Moreover, ‘1680 yuan’, a plausible amount of money for the kind of ‘deficit’ he claims to have been incurred, shows his knowledge of relevant information, further improving his credibility. (A rounded up number such as 2000 yuan would sound much less convincing.) Nevertheless, E’s following discourse contradicts his fabricated identity. For instance, the serious tone, the switch from honorific nin 您 ‘you’ to regular ‘you’ (ni 你) and the shift from informing to the warning of ‘your bank account is controlled by a gang of criminals for money laundering, drug deals, and gun smuggling’ and the imperative ‘transfer all your money into a safe account’ sounds more characteristic of a police officer than a Telecom clerk. In reality, Telecom has no access to such information, and its services include neither ‘arresting gangs’ nor ‘protecting assets’. Given a reciprocal relationship between identity and discursive practices (Chen, 2018, p. 39), it seems that the mismatch between identity and discourse compromises E’s intention to intimidate F and contaminates F’s fabrication as a Telecom clerk. As a matter of fact, many targets discovered this mismatch at this point.2 Apparently, whether the discursive contents match the assumed identity is an effective cue for detecting deception.","output":"5.2.3 “业务员”身份 “业务员”身份指的是商业机构中的工作人员，比如百货商店或电力供应商。利用这种情境类型来构造虚假身份进行欺诈的骗子通常通过假装提供服务来欺骗人们，就像案例（3）中所示。 案例（3）背景：一个听起来中年的男人E打电话给F先生。与之前的案例不同，骗子E直接声称自己是电信公司的官方职员。为了加强对其身份构建的印象，他使用标准的普通话，礼貌的用语，如“您好”和敬语“您”，以及透支、停机等技术术语。此外，“1680元”，对于他声称已经发生的“透支”而言是一个合理的金额，显示了他对相关信息的了解，进一步提高了他的可信度。（2000元这样四舍五入的数字会听起来不那么令人信服。）然而，E接下来的言辞与他所编造的身份相矛盾。例如，严肃的语气，从敬语“您”到常规的“你”，从通知变成“你的银行账户受到一个犯罪团伙控制，用于洗钱、毒品交易和走私枪支”的警告，以及“将你的所有钱转到一个安全账户”的命令，更符合警察而不是电信职员的特征。事实上，电信公司并没有访问这样的信息的权限，其业务既不包括“捕捉犯罪团伙”也不包括“保护资产”。鉴于身份与话语实践之间存在相互关系（陈，2018，第39页），似乎身份与话语不匹配削弱了E威胁F并感染F作为电信职员的虚构意图。实际上，许多受害者在这一点上发现了这种不匹配。显然，话语内容是否与假定的身份相符是检测欺诈的一个有效线索。 Note: Please be aware that the translation provided here is for reference only and may require further review and revision."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “That’s strange…Natsuki hasn’t shown up yet.” Sayori: “She’s just out getting our snacks.

In this sense, targets are powerless to challenge the authority, having no choice but to obey the command. For instance: Case (4) Context: A woman G calls Mrs H on her mobile phone. In Case (4), the con artist G directly claims that she is a prosecutor in the Judicial Department, assuming a superior–inferior relation with H. G starts the conversa￾tion with an exclamation wei 喂 without any other form of address. The directive speech act (‘We need your cooperation.’ ‘We must…’) highlighted by a meticu￾lous, serious, and stern tone further enhances the construction of her identity as someone with a much higher social status. Then G accelerates her speed of talking, resorts to an intimidating and coercing tone, and urges H to act (empha￾sising ‘This is an emergency! Tell me! Cancel it! Hurry up!’), leaving H no time to suspect her identity. Institutional jargon (‘suspect’, ‘corruption’, ‘embezzlement’, ‘account restriction’, etc.) coupled with inside information (‘The verification code is in fact your case number’) reinforces her official government identity as well. Throughout the whole conversation, G exploits H’s anxiety on the one hand (warning: ‘You are suspected to be involved in a corruption’) and on the other hand eases H’s worry from time to time (promising: ‘in order to exonerate your charge; our leader will …’). 5.2.5 The identity ‘resourceful person’ The identity resourceful person refers to the supply–demand relationship that a person enacts with his/her conversation partner, usually established on the basis of friend/kin identity, business clerk identity, or government official identity. Unlike the previous ones, which form a direct emotional or institutional relationship with the target, the identity resourceful person exploits its presumed power, wealth, and status to supposedly satisfy the target. Case (5) is an example. Case (5) Context: Near a real estate agency, a man J approaches Mr K. Mr K was unable to find a suitable condo . In Case (5), the con artist J constructs the identity of a resourceful person in real estate by fabricating a familial relationship with the board chairman of Zhongwang Group. Indeed, J’s real name is Liu Zhongping and the board chairman is Liu Zhongtian; but the fraternal relationship does not exist. J thus successfully constructs a temporary ‘supply–demand’ relationship embedded in the interactional identity of brotherhood. As is evidenced in previous research, deceptive and non-deceptive discourse must be interwoven to get a lie across (Galasinski, 2000; Palena et al., 2019). Interestingly, though J posits his identity in a direct manner, he talks in a mysterious tone, which in fact makes K more convinced. His assumed familiarity with the construction project and its unit price, showing him to be an ‘insider’, serves as a side proof for his made-up identity. What is more, the speech act of promise ‘I assure you’, together with ‘I can help you’ construct a helpful personal identity. In the face of the ‘warm-hearted’ and ‘high-status’ brother to the board chairman, the target pays the deposit without hesitation. By and large, a detailed examination of the fraud cases further shows that certain types of identity may correspond to certain linguistic devices. For instance, standard Mandarin plus polite address forms such as the honorific ‘you’ seem to be necessary in order to gain trust from strangers with equal status; con artists who adopt victim identity, old friend identity, or resourceful person identity turn more to speech acts of request and promise, whereas those who adopt judicial identity resort to directives; institutional identity such as telecom and judicial officials often correspond to con artists referring to themselves as representatives of the institutions.","output":"5.2.4 身份为“司法官” 司法官是政府机构的一个身份，不同于业务员身份，因为前者直接对个人拥有管辖权而后者没有。从这个意义上说，目标无力挑战权威，别无选择只能服从命令。例如: 案例（4）情境：女性G给H女士打电话。在案例（4）中，骗子G直接声称自己是司法部门的检察官，假设与H的上下级关系。G用喂（wei）打招呼，没有使用其他称呼。她以严肃、认真和严厉的口气开始对话中的指示言语行为（“我们需要你的合作。”，“我们必须…”），强化她身份的建构，使她被认为是一个地位更高的人。随后，G加快说话速度，采用威胁和强迫的语气，催促H行动（强调“这是紧急情况！告诉我！取消它！赶快！”），不给H怀疑她身份的时间。机构术语（“怀疑”，“腐败”，“挪用公款”，“账户限制”等）结合内部信息（“验证码实际上是您的案件编号”）进一步强调了她作为官方政府身份。在整个对话过程中，G一方面利用H的焦虑（警告说：“你涉嫌腐败行为”），另一方面不时减轻H的担忧（承诺：“为了证明你清白；我们的领导人将…”）。 5.2.5 身份为“机智人” 机智人身份指的是一个人与他/她的对话伙伴之间所表现的供求关系，通常是在朋友/亲属身份、业务员身份或政府官员身份的基础上建立的。与前几种直接与目标建立情感或制度关系的身份不同，机智人身份利用其被假定的权力、财富和地位来假设地满足目标。案例（5）是一个例子。 案例（5）情境：在一个房地产中介附近，一位男士J接近了K先生。K先生无法找到合适的公寓。在案例（5）中，骗子J通过虚构与中旺集团董事长的亲属关系来塑造自己是一个房地产方面有能力资源的身份。实际上，J的真名是刘中平，而董事长的名字是刘中天；但他们之间并没有亲兄弟关系。J因此成功地构建了一个暂时的“供求”关系，嵌入到兄弟关系的互动身份中。正如以前的研究所证实的那样，欺骗性和非欺骗性的话语必须交织在一起才能将谎言传达出去（Galasinski, 2000; Palena et al., 2019）。有趣的是，尽管J以直接的态度明确了他的身份，但他以神秘的口吻说话，这实际上更使K相信他。他对该工程和单价的详细了解，显示他是一个“内部人”，也为他编造的身份提供了证据。而且，承诺的言语行为“我向你保证”，与“我可以帮助你”一起构建了一个乐于助人的个人身份。在面对与董事长兄弟般“热心”和“高地位”的人时，目标毫不犹豫地支付了定金。 总的来说，对欺诈案件的详细审查进一步显示了某些类型的身份可能与某些语言手段相对应。例如，标准的普通话加上礼貌的称呼形式，如尊敬的“您”，似乎是为了获得与平等地位的陌生人的信任；采取受害者身份、老朋友身份或机智人身份的骗子更多地使用请求和承诺的言语行为，而采取司法身份的骗子则多使用指示语；电信和司法官员等制度身份通常对应于骗子自称机构代表的情况。"},{"instruction":"[Format your response using markdown.

The first homage is paid on Thursday in the synagogue, the event being announced by trumpets, and every one sends presents to the exilarch according to his means. The leaders of the community and the wealthy send handsome garments, jewelry, and gold and silver vessels. On Thursday and Friday the exilarch gives great banquets. On the morning of the Sabbath the nobles of the community call for him and accompany him to the synagogue. Here a wooden platform covered entirely with costly cloth has been erected, under which a picked choir of sweet-voiced youths well versed in the liturgy has been placed. This choir responds to the leader in prayer, who begins the service with 'Baruk she-amar.' After the morning prayer the exilarch, who until now has been standing in a covered place, appears; the whole congregation rises and remains standing until he has taken his place on the platform, and the two geonim, the one from Sura preceding, have taken seats to his right and left, each making an obeisance. A costly canopy has been erected over the seat of the exilarch. Then the leader in prayer steps in front of the platform and, in a low voice audible only to those close by, and accompanied by the 'Amen' of the choir, addresses the exilarch with a benediction, prepared long beforehand. Then the exilarch delivers a sermon on the text of the week or commissions the gaon of Sura to do so. After the discourse the leader in prayer recites the kaddish, and when he reaches the words 'during your life and in your days,' he adds the words 'and during the life of our prince, the exilarch.' After the kaddish he blesses the exilarch, the two heads of the schools, and the several provinces that contribute to the support of the academies, as well as the individuals who have been of especial service in this direction. Then the Torah is read. When the 'Kohen' and 'Levi' have finished reading, the leader in prayer carries the Torah roll to the exilarch, the whole congregation rising; the exilarch takes the roll in his hands and reads from it while standing. The two heads of the schools also rise, and the gaon of Sura recites the targum to the passage read by the exilarch. When the reading of the Torah is completed, a blessing is pronounced upon the exilarch. After the 'Musaf' prayer the exilarch leaves the synagogue, and all, singing, accompany him to his house. After that the exilarch rarely goes beyond the gate of his house, where services for the community are held on the Sabbaths and feastdays. When it becomes necessary for him to leave his house, he does so only in a carriage of state, accompanied by a large retinue. If the exilarch desires to pay his respects to the king, he first asks permission to do so. As he enters the palace the king's servants hasten to meet him, among whom he liberally distributes gold coin, for which provision has been made beforehand. When led before the king his seat is assigned to him. The king then asks what he desires.

Who is the Prince? Who is the King? How does this dynamic work? I was raised Catholic and I am so confused. I am referring to these positions in general not a specific person.","output":"The Exilarch, in the context described in the passage, refers to the leader of the Jewish community in Babylon during the Geonic period, which spanned from the 6th to the 11th century CE. The position of Exilarch was hereditary and held by the descendants of King David. The Exilarch was considered the temporal head of the Jewish community and held political and religious authority. The term \\"prince\\" in this passage refers specifically to the exilarch, who is the prince of the Jewish community in Babylon. It is a title given to the leader due to their ancestral connection to the royal lineage of King David. The mention of the \\"king\\" in the passage does not refer to a specific individual. It is likely intended to depict the hypothetical scenario of the exilarch visiting a powerful ruler or king, possibly the reigning monarch of the region. The exilarch, as the leader and representative of the Jewish community, seeks permission to approach and pay respects to the king, presenting requests and seeking favor. The dynamic between the exilarch and the king would have varied depending on various factors, such as the political climate, regional power dynamics, and the relationship between the Jewish community and the ruling powers. The exilarch, as a representative of the Jewish community, would navigate this relationship by employing diplomatic language, praising the king, appealing to ancestral customs, and presenting requests in hopes of gaining the favor and support of the ruling powers for the Jewish community's benefit. The exilarch's role as a religious and political leader would involve maintaining a delicate balance between upholding Jewish traditions, preserving their identity, and navigating relationships with the ruling powers to ensure the community's wellbeing and protection."},{"instruction":"Did all Jews recognize the authority of the Exilarch or was it only Jews living in the region?","output":"The authority of the Exilarch was primarily recognized and respected by the Jews living in the region of Babylon during the Geonic period. The Exilarch held a position of leadership and influence within the Babylonian Jewish community. However, it is important to note that the Jewish diaspora during that time extended beyond Babylon, with Jewish communities in other regions and cities. The level of recognition and influence of the Exilarch outside of Babylon varied. In some cases, Jewish communities outside of Babylon acknowledged the Exilarch's authority and sought guidance from the Babylonian leadership due to the prestige and historical significance associated with the position. However, the reach of the Exilarch's authority and the extent to which it was recognized by Jews in other regions likely varied based on local circumstances, regional leadership structures, and cultural differences. It is also worth mentioning that during the Geonic period, there were other centers of Jewish learning and authority, such as the academies of Sura and Pumbedita. The relationship between the Exilarch and these academies was intricate, with both entities contributing to the religious and communal life of Jewish communities in Babylon. In summary, while the Exilarch's authority was primarily acknowledged by Jews residing in Babylon, the degree to which Jews in other regions recognized and respected this authority would have varied based on the specific local context."},{"instruction":"Are the Babylonian Jews the ones that stayed in Babylon even after the Post-Exilic period?","output":"Yes, the Babylonian Jews are descendants of the Jewish community that initially settled in Babylonia during the Babylonian exile or the Post-Exilic period. After the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE and the subsequent destruction of the First Temple, many Jews were deported to Babylonia. These Jews, known as the Babylonian exile community, formed a significant Jewish population in Babylonia. While some Jews returned to Jerusalem after the Persian conquest and the permission granted by Cyrus the Great to rebuild the Second Temple, a considerable number of Jews remained in Babylonia. They established thriving communities and centers of learning, such as the academies of Sura and Pumbedita, which became influential in Jewish scholarship and religious practice during the Talmudic and Geonic periods. The Babylonian Jewish community in Babylonia endured for centuries, even after the conquests by subsequent empires such as the Parthians and Sassanians. The community played a crucial role in the development and transmission of Jewish scholarship and religious law, and their contributions had a lasting impact on Jewish history and culture."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, while the intentions behind organic farming are noble, there is an ongoing debate regarding its impact on animal and plant health. This essay aims to explore the potential drawbacks of organic farming methods, shedding light on why they may not always be healthy for animals and plants. 1. Reduced crop yields: One significant concern associated with organic farming is the lower productivity compared to conventional methods. Organic farming practices often rely on the use of organic fertilizers, which, while beneficial for soil health, may be less efficient in providing essential nutrients to plants compared to synthetic fertilizers. Consequently, organic crops may experience weaker growth and lower yields (Bourn & Prescott, 2002). 2. Pest and disease control challenges: Organic farmers face considerable challenges in controlling pests and diseases without relying on synthetic chemical pesticides. The absence of these pesticides, which are typically formulated to target specific pests, increases the likelihood of crop damage and disease outbreaks (Seufert et al., 2012). Infestations and diseases can negatively impact plant health and productivity, compromising the availability of organic produce. 3. Livestock diseases and parasites: In organic animal farming, the avoidance of synthetic medicines and preventive treatments can present challenges in managing the health of livestock. Organic livestock are more prone to diseases and parasites due to limited use of antibiotics and chemical dewormers (Lund et al., 2006). This may lead to increased morbidity and decreased well-being of animals within organic farming systems. 4. Unaddressed nutritional deficiencies: In order to meet organic certification standards, farmers are often limited in terms of the types of livestock feeds and supplements they can use. Resultantly, animals may face nutritional deficiencies, particularly in vitamins and minerals (Magkos et al., 2006). Ongoing research is needed to ensure adequate diets are provided to organic animals, promoting their optimal nutrition and health. 5. Risk of contamination by pathogens: While organic farming discourages the use of synthetic pesticides, the reliance on manures and composts as fertilizers poses a risk of contamination by pathogens. Improper composting or handling of manure can result in the spread of harmful bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella, which can cause serious health issues in both animals and humans (Bourn & Prescott, 2002). Conclusion Although organic farming has its merits in terms of environmental sustainability and reduced exposure to synthetic chemicals, it is crucial to recognize the potential challenges it poses for animal and plant health. Reduced crop yields, pest and disease control challenges, livestock diseases and parasites, nutritional deficiencies, and the risk of pathogen contamination are significant concerns that require careful consideration within organic farming practices.

Moreover, con artists tend to exploit their pre-existing identities, especially their personal identities. On the one hand, the con artist’s attempt to change their real personal identity such as gender, age, or ethnicity through discursive practices would face tremendous challenges and it is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, interactional and situational identities tend to be context-specific, fabricated if an opportunity is provided. Since others do not automatically vali￾date a person’s claims to be honest, reasonable, etc, pre-existing personal attrib￾utes in frauds are usually subordinate to other identities. For instance, in Case (1), the assumption that women are the relatively ‘weaker’ gender (than men) is read- 116 east asian pragmatics ily made use of by con artists. In Case (2), a question such as ‘Guess who I am?’ accords with women’s style of speech. In Case (5), the resemblance between the names of Liu Zhongping and Liu Zhongtian creates in people’s minds the possibility that they may be brothers. Similarly, Liu Zhongping’s identity as a resourceful person is based on his interactional identity as ‘brother of Liu Zhongtian’. Interestingly, although Liu Zhongping’s self-assumed personal identity violates common expectation, it facilitates the deceptive act: since people with high power and insider information are usually indifferent, the ‘help’ from ‘a brother of the board chairman’ is indeed hard to resist. 6. Adaptation involved in the identity fabrication In this section, we discuss the motivations for con artists to construct specific identities in specific contexts and on specific targets. As indicated earlier, we view con artists’ construction of the identities concerned as being in part motivated by their need to adapt to the particular discourse they are engaged in (Chen, 2018). Since all the 72 fraud cases examined for this article fall into the five types of identities outlined above, we cannot help but wonder whether these identities were chosen at random or on purpose and why they were preferred over others. As is suggested in our discussion of the theoretical framework we adopt, con artists fabricate identities according to factors in physical, social, and mental worlds. If they do not adapt to these three worlds, they may fail to match the fabricated identities with the corresponding discursive practices. In this section, we present more fraud cases (Table 3). 6.1 Adaptation to the physical world Due to the fast advancement of technology and urbanisation, people in China have become heavily dependent on the Internet and the mobile phone to conduct activities in their life, which has led to a paucity of face-to-face communication. This has been taken advantage of by con artists in two principal ways. First, they use the mobile phone as a mode of communication to contact the target and to commit the fraud, as is seen in Cases (2), (3), and (4). If a fraud is conducted in a physical location, the location tends to be a place crowded with people who are strangers to each other, such as a matchmaking agency, bar, beauty salon, or the busy street, so that the con artist can easily hide his or her true identity. Second, the identity of a telecom clerk has become a distinctive identity as shown above. This is significant because telecom clerk is a professional identity, and the list of possible professional identities in a given culture must be very long. The fact that con artists have chosen the telecom profession as their favourite speaks much to their effort to adapt to the physical world of modern China, whereby so much communication is conducted by phone. 6.2 Adaptation to the social world A social setting imposes many constraints on the way linguistic acts can be per￾formed. It also determines who has the right to perform them (Verschueren, 1999, p. 91). Accordingly, con artists adapt to the ratified convention between identity and speech acts. For instance, the con artists who construct the identity of a tele￾com clerk in Case (3) and in case 10086 in Table 8 adapt to the fact that one of the functions of telecom companies is to inform clients of abnormal account activity. In the same vein, the institutionally defined power of the government, including judicial official in Case (4) and the Education Bureau in Table 8, enables con art￾ists to give orders and commands. As the target in Case (4) recollects, “When she Table 3: Information on fraud crimes","output":"此外，骗子往往会利用他们现有的身份，尤其是个人身份。一方面，骗子试图通过话语实践改变他们真实的个人身份，如性别、年龄或种族，这将面临巨大的挑战，通常是不必要的。另一方面，互动和情境身份往往是特定环境下的身份，如果有机会的话则经常是虚构的。由于别人并不会自动验证一个人诚实、合理等的声称，诈骗中已有的个人属性通常处于其他身份之下。例如，在案例1中，骗子往往会利用女性相对“较弱”的性别假设。在案例2中，“猜猜我是谁？”这样的问题与女性的说话风格相符。在案例5中，刘忠平和刘忠天的名字相似，让人们脑海中产生他们可能是兄弟的可能性。同样，刘忠平作为一个足智多谋的人的身份是基于他作为“刘忠天的兄弟”的互动身份。有趣的是，尽管刘忠平自认的个人身份违反了普遍期望，但它促进了欺骗行为：由于高权力和内部信息的人通常都漠不关心，“董事长的兄弟”的“帮助”确实很难抵制。 第6节 中学伪造身份所涉的适应性 在本节中，我们讨论骗子构建特定身份的动机，这些身份是为了适应他们所参与的特定话语（Chen, 2018）。由于本文检查的72起欺诈案例属于上述五种身份类型，我们不禁要思考这些身份是随机选择还是有意选择，以及为什么它们优于其他身份。正如我们在所采用的理论框架讨论中提到的，骗子根据现实世界、社会世界和心理世界的因素伪造身份。如果他们不适应这三个世界，他们可能无法将伪造的身份与相应的话语实践相匹配。在本节中，我们提供更多的欺诈案例（表3）。 6.1 对现实世界的适应 由于技术的快速发展和城市化的推进，中国人民已经严重依赖互联网和手机来进行生活中的活动，这导致了面对面交流的匮乏。这为骗子提供了两种主要的机会。首先，他们使用手机作为通信方式来联系目标并进行欺诈，正如案例（2）、（3）和（4）所示。如果欺诈行为发生在实际场所，场所往往是人陌生的拥挤地点，如婚介所、酒吧、美容院或繁忙街道，以便骗子可以轻松隐藏自己的真实身份。其次，电信职员的身份已经成为一个鲜明的身份，如上面所示。这是一个重要的因素，因为电信职员是一个专业身份，而在给定文化中可能会有很多可能的专业身份。骗子之所以选择电信行业作为他们的首选，表明他们努力适应中国现代社会中的物理世界，即如此多的通信是通过电话进行的。 6.2 对社会世界的适应 社会环境对语言行为的方式施加了许多限制。它还决定了谁有权进行这些行为（Verschueren，1999，第91页）。因此，骗子适应了身份和言语行为之间的认可准则。例如，在案例（3）中构建电信职员身份的骗子以及表3中的10086案件适应了电信公司的一个功能，即告知客户异常账户活动。同样，在案例（4）中的司法官员和表3中的教育局，制度定义的政府权力使骗子能够下达命令。正如案例（4）中的受害者回忆：“她说，‘这是法院的通知，只有你能帮助我们。”在案例（5）中，骗子制造的医生身份允许他提供医疗建议，因为医生在社会中享有信誉。通过适应社会世界，骗子能够更好地伪装自己的身份并达到欺骗的目的。"},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “That’s strange…Natsuki hasn’t shown up yet.” Sayori: “She’s just out getting our snacks.

How did Rabbinical Judaism evolve over this eras?","output":"# Rabbinical Eras in Judaism The Rabbinical eras in Judaism span from the 2nd century BCE to the present day. These eras are characterized by the establishment of the rabbinic authority and the development of Rabbinical Judaism. Here are the key eras and their significance: 1. The Tannaitic Era (2nd century BCE - 3rd century CE) - **Important Figures**: Rabbis of the Mishnah, including Hillel and Shammai. - **Significance**: The period of the Mishnah's compilation, which codified Jewish oral traditions into a written text, providing a foundation for Rabbinical Judaism. - **Evolution**: The establishment of the Oral Law, the foundation of Rabbinical authority, and the importance of legal discussions and interpretations. 2. The Amoraic Era (3rd century - 6th century CE) - **Important Figures**: Talmudic scholars, such as Rav Yochanan and Rav Ashi, who compiled the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. - **Significance**: The period of the Talmud's compilation, providing further interpretations, discussions, and debates on Jewish law and ethics. - **Evolution**: The Talmud became a central text, serving as a guide for religious practice and shaping Rabbinical Judaism's religious and legal traditions. 3. The Geonic Era (6th century - 11th century CE) - **Important Figures**: Geonim (leading scholars), such as Saadia Gaon and Sherira Gaon. - **Significance**: The Geonim were leaders of the Jewish academies in Babylonia, responsible for interpreting Jewish law, answering legal queries, and transmitting knowledge. - **Evolution**: The Geonim strengthened Rabbinical authority by providing authoritative legal responsa and establishing the academies as centers of Jewish learning and leadership. 4. The Rishonic Era (11th century - 15th century CE) - **Important Figures**: Prominent Rabbis of this era include Rashi, Maimonides, and Nachmanides. - **Significance**: Major scholars emerged, producing significant commentaries and legal works, shaping Jewish thought and practice. - **Evolution**: The production of influential legal codes such as the Mishneh Torah and the Shulchan Aruch brought further organization to Rabbinical Judaism, making Jewish law more accessible to the masses. 5. The Acharonic Era (Late 15th century CE - Present) - **Important Figures**: Key figures include Rabbi Joseph Caro, Rabbi Moses Isserles, and modern scholars like Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. - **Significance**: Continued commentaries, legal works, and philosophical writings help adapt Rabbinical Judaism to modern challenges and changes. - **Evolution**: Rabbinical Judaism has adapted to various socio-political contexts, experiencing reforms, denominational differences, and intellectual developments, while maintaining core Rabbinical traditions and authority.

Decision tree for classification: A decision tree for classification is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome or class label. It is used to classify instances into different classes based on a set of features or attributes. The decision tree is built by recursively partitioning the data based on the selected attribute that maximizes the information gain or Gini index. B. Decision tree for regression: A decision tree for regression is similar to a decision tree for classification, but instead of class labels, it predicts continuous numerical values as the outcome. Each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the predicted regression value. The decision tree is built by recursively partitioning the data based on the selected attribute that minimizes the sum of squared errors or any other suitable measure. C. Nodes, branches, and leaves in decision trees: 1. Nodes: Nodes in a decision tree represent either internal nodes or leaf nodes. Internal nodes represent a feature or attribute, and they split the data based on a decision rule. Leaf nodes, also known as terminal nodes, represent the outcome or predicted value. 2. Branches: Branches in a decision tree represent the decision rules that split the data based on the selected attribute at each internal node. Each branch leads to a different path or sub-tree based on the decision made. 3. Leaves: Leaves in a decision tree represent the final predicted outcome or value. They are the end points of the tree where the decision-making process concludes.

Basic concepts and principles of decision trees A. Decision tree for classification B. Decision tree for regression C. Nodes, branches and leaves in decision trees","output":"A. Decision tree for classification refers to the use of decision trees to classify data into different classes or categories. Each internal node in the tree represents a feature or attribute, and each branch represents a decision or condition based on that feature. The leaves of the tree represent the predicted class labels. Decision trees for classification are commonly used in various fields, such as data mining, machine learning, and pattern recognition. B. Decision tree for regression involves using decision trees to predict numerical values or continuous outcomes. Similar to classification decision trees, each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each branch represents a decision or condition based on that feature. However, instead of predicting discrete classes, the leaves of the tree in regression decision trees contain continuous values. Decision trees for regression are commonly used in areas like finance, economics, and forecasting. C. Nodes, branches, and leaves are key components of decision trees. - Nodes: In a decision tree, nodes represent specific features or attributes on which decisions are made during the splitting process. Internal nodes, often referred to as decision nodes, contain a condition or a test for a particular feature. The root node is the starting point, from which the tree branches out into different decision paths. The leaf nodes or terminal nodes are the endpoints of the decision paths and represent the final predicted class or value. - Branches: Branches in a decision tree represent the different decision paths taken based on the values of features or attributes. Each branch represents a specific decision or condition, leading to the next set of nodes or ultimately to a leaf node. - Leaves: Leaves in a decision tree represent the final predicted class or value. They are the endpoints or final outcomes of the decision process. In classification decision trees, each leaf represents a specific class label, while in regression decision trees, each leaf contains a predicted continuous value. By traversing the branches and nodes of a decision tree, starting from the root node and following the decision paths, we can reach the appropriate leaf node that provides the predicted class or value for a particular example or instance."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

We’re right here with you, supporting you every step of the way!” (Yuri’s face turns red with exertion as she continues to push, her grip on Sayori’s hand becoming tighter.)

The paramedics rush inside and quickly assess the situation.) Paramedic: “Alright, we’re here. What’s the situation?” Monika: “Our friend, Yuri, is in labor. Her contractions started, and she’s been pushing for a while now.” Yuri: (pushing yet again) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I think I feel the head coming through!!!”","output":"Paramedic: \\"Okay, let's get you on the stretcher and into the ambulance, Yuri. We'll take care of you and make sure Violet arrives safely.\\" (Yuri is quickly moved onto the stretcher, with Sayori and Monika closely by her side.

Just a little longer, and we'll be at the hospital.\\" Sayori: \\"We're right here with you, Yuri. You're so strong, and Violet will be here before you know it.\\" (Yuri continues to push through the pain, her determination unwavering. The paramedics work swiftly and efficiently, providing support and guidance.) Paramedic: \\"Alright, Yuri, it's working. Keep pushing, we can see the baby's head now. Just a few more pushes.\\" Yuri: (with tears in her eyes) \\"I...I can see the finish line...I can do this. For Violet.\\" (Sayori holds Yuri's hand tightly, offering words of encouragement, while Monika stands in awe of Yuri's strength and determination.) Monika: \\"You're doing so well, Yuri. We're all so proud of you. Just a little more, and you'll meet Violet.\\" Sayori: \\"Just a few more pushes, Yuri. You've got this.

The room fills with a mixture of relief and joy as the baby's cries fill the air.) Paramedic: \\"Congratulations, Yuri. You did it. You have a beautiful baby girl.\\" (Yuri's exhausted but radiant smile mirrors the pride and happiness in her friends' faces.) Yuri: (tearfully) \\"Thank you...thank you all. I couldn't have done it without you.\\" (The paramedics carefully tend to Yuri and Violet, ensuring their well-being as they prepare to transport them to the hospital.) Monika: \\"We'll meet you at the hospital, Yuri. We'll call the others and let them know.\\" Sayori: \\"You did amazing, Yuri. We'll be right behind you. Violet is going to have the best, most loving mommy.\\" (Yuri is gently wheeled out of the clubroom, with Violet cradled in her arms. Sayori and Monika watch them go, their hearts filled with warmth and gratitude for the incredible journey they just witnessed.) Monika: \\"Life is truly an incredible miracle, isn't it?\\" Sayori: \\"It really is. And we were lucky enough to be part of Yuri's miracle.\\" (With hopeful smiles, Sayori and Monika leave the clubroom, ready to reunite with Yuri and Violet at the hospital, and to cherish the beautiful bond they all share.)"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold to organize the information] From the establishment of the Kingdom of England to the Acts of Union in 1707, how many royal houses have sat on the throne of England? How did each one gain the throne? How were they removed?","output":"Number of Royal Houses that have sat on the throne of England: There have been **seven** royal houses that have sat on the throne of England from the establishment of the Kingdom of England to the Acts of Union in 1707. How each royal house gained the throne: 1. House of Wessex (871-1066): The House of Wessex gained the throne through inheritance and conquest, with notable rulers such as Alfred the Great and Edward the Confessor. 2. House of Normandy (1066-1154): The House of Normandy gained the throne when William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, successfully invaded England in 1066, defeating the last Saxon king Harold II at the Battle of Hastings. 3. House of Plantagenet (1154-1485): The House of Plantagenet gained the throne through a combination of inheritance and conquest. Henry II, the first Plantagenet king, inherited the throne through his mother, Matilda, who was the daughter of Henry I. Other Plantagenet rulers gained the throne through various means, including Richard I through inheritance and Edward I through conquest. 4. House of Lancaster (1399-1461, 1470-1471): The House of Lancaster gained the throne when Henry Bolingbroke, also known as Henry IV, successfully deposed his cousin Richard II in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. The Lancastrian line was later interrupted by the House of York, but briefly regained power during the period of Edward IV's brief exile. 5. House of York (1461-1470, 1471-1485): The House of York gained the throne when Edward IV successfully deposed Henry VI, a Lancastrian, during the Wars of the Roses. The Yorkist line was interrupted when Henry VI briefly regained power, but Edward IV reclaimed the throne and his son Edward V succeeded him after his death. 6. House of Tudor (1485-1603): The House of Tudor gained the throne when Henry Tudor, also known as Henry VII, defeated Richard III, the last Yorkist king, at the Battle of Bosworth Field. This marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. 7. House of Stuart (1603-1707): The House of Stuart gained the throne through the death of Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch, without any direct heirs. James VI of Scotland, who was already from the Stuart dynasty, became James I of England, uniting the crowns of England and Scotland. How each royal house was removed: 1. House of Wessex: The House of Wessex saw a change with the Norman Conquest in 1066, where Harold II, the last Saxon king, was defeated and killed by William the Conqueror. 2. House of Normandy: The House of Normandy ended when Henry II, the last Norman king, began the reign of the Plantagenet dynasty by becoming the first Plantagenet king. 3. House of Plantagenet: The House of Plantagenet was effectively ended during the Wars of the Roses, with the defeat of Richard III, the last Plantagenet king, by Henry Tudor (Henry VII) of the House of Tudor. 4. House of Lancaster: The House of Lancaster lost the throne to the House of York during the Wars of the Roses, but briefly regained power during the period of Edward IV's exile, only to finally be defeated by the Tudors. 5. House of York: The House of York lost the throne to the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, but Edward IV reclaimed the throne for the Yorkists. However, after the death of Richard III and the ascent of Henry VII, the House of York was effectively ended. 6. House of Tudor: The House of Tudor ended when Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch, died without any direct descendants. This led to the succession of James I, a member of the House of Stuart. 7. House of Stuart: The House of Stuart was removed from the throne of England with the Acts of Union in 1707, which created the United Kingdom of Great Britain, joining England and Scotland into a single country."},{"instruction":"Was William III & Mary II and Anne Stuarts?","output":"Yes, William III and Mary II as well as Anne were part of the House of Stuart. 1. William III and Mary II (1689-1694): They were joint monarchs who gained the throne through the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Mary II was the daughter of James II (a Stuart monarch) and William III was her husband. They replaced James II due to discontent over his Catholic beliefs and autocratic rule. 2. Anne (1702-1714): Anne was the younger sister of Mary II and a Stuart monarch. She became queen after William III's death. Anne had no surviving children, and therefore the House of Stuart ended with her reign. Note: The House of Stuart was followed by the House of Hanover, who ascended the throne after the death of Anne."},{"instruction":"What houses ruled Britain from the Acts of Union to present?","output":"From the Acts of Union in 1707 to the present, the following houses have ruled Britain: 1. House of Hanover (1714-1901): The House of Hanover gained the throne with the accession of George I in 1714. The Hanoverian dynasty originated in Germany and came to power through their Protestant connection and the provisions of the Act of Settlement. Notable Hanoverian monarchs include George III, who ruled during the American Revolution, and Queen Victoria, who had the longest reign in British history. 2. House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1901-1917): The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha began with the accession of King Edward VII in 1901. This house originated in Germany and was a branch of the House of Wettin. However, due to the anti-German sentiment during World War I, King George V changed the name of the royal house to the House of Windsor in 1917. 3. House of Windsor (1917-present): The House of Windsor, which is the current royal house, began when King George V changed the name of the royal family from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor during World War I to display their British identity. The House of Windsor has continued to reign over Britain to the present day. Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, is a member of the House of Windsor. It is important to note that while the monarchy has continued under the House of Windsor, the role of the monarchy has evolved over time, transitioning from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with limited powers."},{"instruction":"So the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Windsor are the same house?","output":"Yes, the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Windsor are essentially the same house, although they had different names. In 1917, during World War I, due to anti-German sentiment in Britain, King George V decided to change the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. The name change was primarily to emphasize the British connection and distance themselves from their German heritage. Therefore, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha became the House of Windsor, which is still the reigning house today. Despite the name change, the lineage and family remained the same."},{"instruction":"Why did the Windsors not change their name after the war?","output":"The name \\"Windsor\\" was retained by the royal family after the war because it had significant symbolic value and represented their connection with the British people. There are a few reasons why the Windsors did not change their name again after World War II: 1. Historical Continuity: The name \\"Windsor\\" had been associated with the British monarchy since 1917 when King George V adopted it. By keeping the name, the royal family maintained a sense of historical continuity and stability. 2. Identification with the Nation: The name \\"Windsor\\" had become synonymous with the British royal family and was widely accepted by the public. Changing the name again could have created confusion and potentially undermined the popularity and support for the monarchy. 3. Symbolic Importance: The Windsor name was connected to Windsor Castle, one of the official residences of the British monarchs. This added a sense of tradition and rootedness to the name, further reinforcing its significance. 4. Practical Considerations: Changing the name would have required legal and administrative processes to update official documents, titles, and other references. This would have been a complex and time-consuming task, and it was deemed unnecessary as the name \\"Windsor\\" already had strong recognition. It is also worth noting that in recent years, with the marriage of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, their descendants carry the hyphenated name \\"Mountbatten-Windsor\\" to incorporate the family name of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, as a gesture of respect and recognition for his contributions to the royal family."},{"instruction":"So if the monarch dies without an heir, Parliament is entitled to invite a member of either a cadet branch or a foreign hereditary lord to the throne? They can just do that?","output":"No, the process of inviting a member of a cadet branch or a foreign hereditary lord to the throne is not a straightforward process, and Parliament does not have unlimited discretion in choosing the new monarch. The rules of succession are guided by constitutional and legal principles in the United Kingdom. Currently, the line of succession is determined by the Act of Settlement of 1701 and the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013. Here are some key points regarding the succession process: 1. Primogeniture: The rules of succession follow male-preference primogeniture, which means that the eldest son (or daughter, if there are no sons) in each generation is the heir apparent. 2. Royal Marriages: The monarch's children and their legitimate descendants are given precedence in the line of succession. However, since the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013, gender is no longer a determining factor in the line of succession. Previously, male heirs would take precedence over their older sisters. 3. Eligibility Criteria: The Act of Settlement of 1701 establishes specific eligibility criteria for individuals who can succeed to the throne, including being Protestant and not being married to a Catholic. 4. Marrying Catholics: Before 2013, marrying a Catholic would disqualify an individual from the line of succession. However, since 2013, a marriage to a Catholic no longer automatically disqualifies someone, although a Catholic themselves still cannot directly ascend to the throne. 5. Parliament and Consent: Any changes to the succession must be approved by each of the Commonwealth realms where the British monarch is also the head of state. Parliament plays a role in considering and approving such changes. Therefore, if a monarch dies without an heir, the line of succession would be traced through the eligible relatives based on the rules outlined above. It is unlikely that Parliament would simply invite a member of a cadet branch or a foreign hereditary lord to the throne without following the established succession laws and constitutional principles."},{"instruction":"The monarch is de jure the head of the Head of the Anglican church, right?","output":"Yes, that is correct. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the de jure (by law) head of the Church of England, which is the Anglican church. This position as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England is a constitutional role that the monarch assumes upon their accession to the throne. As the head of the Church of England, the monarch holds various ceremonial and symbolic roles within the church and has certain responsibilities. These include appointing senior bishops, ratifying changes to the church's laws, and being involved in significant religious events, such as the coronation ceremony and other significant church ceremonies. It's worth noting that the actual governance and day-to-day operations of the Church of England are carried out by its own leadership structure, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, bishops, and other clergy. However, the monarch's position as the head of the church reflects the historical and constitutional relationship between the monarchy and the established church in England."},{"instruction":"Why was the King of Israel and Judah not the High Priest?","output":"The reason for the separation of the roles of the King of Israel and Judah from that of the High Priest can be understood by examining the different nature and functions of these positions in ancient Israelite society. 1. Distinct Roles and Functions: The roles and responsibilities of the King and the High Priest were distinct and separate. The King was primarily responsible for governing the nation, leading the military, and maintaining civil order. The High Priest, on the other hand, had the primary religious authority and was responsible for overseeing the worship and rituals of the Temple, and acting as a mediator between the people and God. 2. Separation of Powers: The separation of powers between the religious and political spheres helped maintain a system of checks and balances. It prevented any single individual from holding complete control over both realms, ensuring a division of authority. 3. Avoiding Conflicts of Interest: By separating the roles, conflicts of interests and potential abuse of power could be minimized. The King might be tempted to manipulate religious rituals for political gains or interfere with the religious hierarchy, which could undermine the religious integrity of the nation. 4. Levitical Priesthood: The High Priesthood was reserved for the descendants of Aaron from the tribe of Levi, specifically the line of Eleazar. This restricted the position to a hereditary priesthood, and not necessarily to a political figure like the King. This distinction emphasized the sacredness of the priestly office and the hereditary lineage connected to it. 5. Focus on Roles and Expertise: By having distinct positions for the King and the High Priest, there was a focus on their respective areas of expertise. This allowed the people of Israel to benefit from individuals who dedicated their lives to specialized functions, ensuring efficiency and competence in their areas of responsibility. It is important to note that the separation of the positions of the King and the High Priest was part of the religious and political structure specifically within ancient Israelite society, as outlined in the Old Testament. Different cultures or historical periods may have had different arrangements or understandings of the roles and hierarchy within their religious and political systems."},{"instruction":"محتاج 300 جملة

Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold to organize the information] In a traditional Anarchist society how would laws be enforced and executed with judges and police?","output":"# Enforcing Laws in a Traditional Anarchist Society In a traditional Anarchist society, where the focus is on decentralized organization and individual autonomy, the concept of enforcing laws with judges and police undergoes significant changes. Here are some key points to consider: Absence of Traditional Legal System Anarchism seeks to minimize or eliminate hierarchical structures, including the traditional legal system. Therefore, there would be no judges or police as commonly understood in such a society. Instead, alternative approaches to maintaining social order and resolving conflicts would emerge. Voluntary Participation in Dispute Resolution Mechanisms In an Anarchist society, the emphasis is on voluntary participation and consensus-based decision-making. Conflict resolution could take the form of community assemblies, mediation, or restorative justice practices. These mechanisms would focus on promoting dialogue, empathy, and mutual agreement rather than punishment. Community-based Policing Rather than having a separate police force, Anarchist societies might opt for community-based policing models. This could involve individuals from the community taking on roles as mediators or arbitrators in conflicts, as well as working together to uphold shared values and protect one another. The emphasis would be on maintaining safety rather than enforcing laws. Emphasis on Education and Prevention Anarchist societies prioritize addressing the root causes of crime and fostering a sense of social responsibility. Education would play a significant role in preventing harm and promoting cooperation. By focusing on creating a society where people have their needs fulfilled and can freely express themselves, the prevalence of crime can be minimized. Direct Action and Mutual Aid Individuals in an Anarchist society would be encouraged to take direct action to prevent harm and resolve conflicts at the grassroots level. Mutual aid networks would be established to provide support and assistance, reducing the likelihood of individuals resorting to harmful behavior due to unmet needs. **Summary** In a traditional Anarchist society, the enforcement and execution of \\"laws\\" would involve decentralized mechanisms centered around community-based policing, voluntary participation in dispute resolution, and a focus on education and prevention.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. Culture, with its invocation of norms and values, is a social-world correlate as well (Verschueren, 1999, p. 94). For one thing, con artists adapt to the social rela￾tionships between different facets of identities. For instance, the victim identity is usually assumed by women, children, the old and the handicapped, because they are more likely to be preyed on by criminals. If the pre-existing personal identity of a con artist is a strong-built young man, he may choose to construct other identities than the victim identity. The fraudster in Case (1) admits that she can defraud much more money when the targets see her in a pitiful and vulner￾able situation. A more complex example is Case (5). The con artist first adapts to the name convention in China that two people who share the same family and middle name may be related. By doing so, he exploits his pre-existing iden￾tity and establishes a fraternally based interactional identity. After that, he takes advantage of the assumption that a close relative to an authority figure can be resourceful in constructing a supply–demand interactional identity. As the tar￾get in Case (5) states, “After I check that he was Liu Zhongping, I buy his words immediately”. Obviously, the assumption that one gains power through access to someone powerful is very much a cultural assumption, as it may not hold in another, presumably more democratic, culture. Another cultural element that may be relevant here is Confucianism. Resulting from the Confucian cardinal guides (i.e. ruler guides subject, father guides son, husband guides wife), to respect and to be subordinate to those with higher social, economic, or religious status is believed to have become a cultural norm in Chi￾nese society. Those with higher status are presumed to be trustworthy. Identities used in the fraud cases as reported in this research have been constructed to adapt to such a tradition. For example, identities such as ‘a person with a degree in higher education from a developed country’ and ‘the daughter of a real-estate shareholder’ both exploit the targets’ trust in higher statuses. The target in Case (5) admits, for instance, “I was totally convinced by Liu Zhongping. I thought it was wrong to doubt this influential man.” Moreover, deeply affected by Confucian￾ism, the Chinese society values interpersonal relationships so much that rejecting requests from friends or relatives is deemed immoral. This is proved by the target in Case (2) as he says, “I would feel guilty if I didn’t lend my friend money”. As such, the old friend identity is exploited by con artists as well. 6.3 Adaptation to the mental world The mental world consists of human affection, beliefs, and desires, among other things (Verschueren, 1999, p. 89). Con artists, therefore, take full advantage of their targets’ emotional reactions: sympathy for victims (Case (1) and the preg￾nant woman in Table 8), friendship (Case (2)), and affection for lovers (man seeking a partner and the beautiful lady in Table 8), desires for reasonably priced condos, promotion in a profession, and even good luck and magic pills. In addition, con artists may adapt to their targets’ beliefs in themselves. For instance, one con artist claims, “Well-educated women are quite easy to be fooled because they think too highly of themselves and believe no one could ever deceive them!” (Toucai Net, 4 November 2010). An expert on Legal Report also observes that “Retirees with high education tend to be overconfident. They may resist the idea of having been deceived.” Interestingly, in the case where the con artist failed, we observe that it was because he failed to adapt to a particular contextual postulate. The con artist in Case (3), for instance, failed because, as the target states, “he does not adapt to the common knowledge that telecom functions as information supplier, not an asset keeper”.","output":"文化是社会世界的一种对应（Verschueren，1999，第94页），通过引用规范和价值观。首先，诈骗艺术家适应不同身份之间的社会关系。例如，受害身份通常由女性、儿童、老人和残障人士所扮演，因为他们更容易成为犯罪分子的捕食对象。如果一个诈骗艺术家的现有个人身份是一个强壮的年轻人，他可能选择构建除了受害者身份之外的其他身份。在案例（1）中，骗子承认当目标人看到她处于可怜和脆弱的境地时，她可以骗取更多的钱。案例（5）是一个更复杂的例子，诈骗艺术家首先适应中国的命名规则，即拥有相同姓和中间名的两个人可能有血缘关系。通过这种方式，他利用了自己原有的身份，建立了一种兄弟关系为基础的互动身份。然后，他利用了这样一个假设：与当权者有亲近关系的亲属在建立供需互动身份方面具有资源优势。正如案例（5）中的目标人所说：“在我核实他是刘中平之后，我立即相信了他的话。”显然，通过接触权力的途径来获得权力的假设是一个非常文化化的假设，在另一个可能更加民主的文化中可能不成立。 另一个在这里可能相关的文化要素是儒家文化。由于儒家的基本准则（即君君臣臣、父父子子、夫夫妻妻），尊重和服从具有更高社会、经济或宗教地位的人被认为已经成为中国社会的一种文化规范。高地位的人被认为值得信任。在此研究中报告的欺诈案例中使用的身份都是根据这种传统构建的。例如，“一位在发达国家获得高等教育学位的人”和“房地产股东的女儿”等身份都利用了目标人对高地位的信任。例如，在案例（5）中，目标人承认：“我完全相信了刘中平。我认为怀疑这位有影响力的人是错误的。”此外，受到儒家思想的深刻影响，中国社会非常重视人际关系，拒绝朋友或亲戚的请求被视为道德错误。这在案例（2）的目标人所说的：“如果我不借钱给我的朋友，我会感到内疚”。因此，老朋友的身份也被骗子利用。 6.3 对心理世界的适应 心理世界包括人类的感情、信仰和欲望等等（Verschueren，1999，第89页）。因此，诈骗艺术家充分利用目标人的情感反应：对受害者的同情（案例（1）和表8中的孕妇），友谊（案例（2）），对恋人的爱情之情（寻找伴侣的男子和表8中的美丽女士），对价格合理的公寓、职业晋升甚至好运和神奇药丸的欲望。此外，诈骗艺术家还可能适应目标人对自己的信念。例如，一位骗子声称：“受过良好教育的女性很容易上当，因为她们对自己过于看重，认为没有人能欺骗她们！”（投财网，2010年11月4日）。法律报告专家也观察到，“受过高等教育的退休人员往往自信过度。他们可能抵制自己被骗的想法。” 有趣的是，在诈骗艺术家失败的案例中，我们观察到这是因为他未能适应特定的背景假设。例如，案例（3）中的诈骗艺术家失败是因为，正如目标人所说：“他没有适应共同认知，即电信公司作为信息提供商而不是资产保管者”。"},{"instruction":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. 7. Conclusion This study has examined real fraud cases and discovered that fabricated identities are often deployed as resources for fraudulent purposes. When practising frauds, con artists appeal to various linguistic strategies, such as the alternate use of the standard (Mandarin) and regional accent, polite and intimate address forms, representative and promise speech acts, and appearing grateful to the target to construct a particular identity suited for the particular fraud. Based on the data we have collected, it has discovered the five most often used identities for fraudulent purposes in China: the victim identity, the friend/kin identity, the business clerk identity, the government official identity, and the resourceful person identity. What underlies the choice of the various types of identity construction is adaptation. In the physical world, con artists adapt to people’s dependence on mobile phones and the Internet; in the social world, they adapt to various cultural conventions; in the mental world, they adapt to targets’ emotions, desires, and beliefs. A failed fraud is thus seen as a result of the con artist’s failure to adapt to a particular contextual correlate. This study has enriched the literature on fraud by examining data in contemporary Chinese contexts. It also has expanded the scope of research on identity construction by incorporating identity fabrication as an important factor in determining the success or failure of the fraudulent acts. The attention to fabricated identities contributes to identity research as well since previous research focused on real identities. Future studies on the topic may take into account non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and bodily actions of con artist. In addition, the five identities used by con artists that have been revealed in this study cannot possibly cover all frauds in China. Future research will no doubt uncover others.","output":"7. 结论 本研究调查了真实的欺诈案例，并发现虚构身份经常被用作欺诈目的的资源。在实施欺诈行为时，诈骗艺术家采用了各种语言策略，例如标准普通话和地方口音的交替使用、礼貌和亲密称呼形式、代表性和承诺性言语行为，并对目标人表示感激，以构建适合特定欺诈行为的特定身份。根据我们收集的数据，发现了在中国最常用于欺诈目的的五种身份：受害者身份、朋友/亲属身份、商务职员身份、政府官员身份和有资源的人身份。 不同类型身份构建背后的基础是适应。在物质世界中，诈骗艺术家适应了人们对手机和互联网的依赖；在社会世界中，他们适应了各种文化习俗；在心理世界中，他们适应了目标人的情感、欲望和信仰。因此，无法成功的诈骗被视为诈骗艺术家未能适应特定情境关联的结果。 本研究通过在中国当代背景下调查数据丰富了关于欺诈的文献。它还将身份制造作为决定欺诈行为成功或失败的重要因素纳入了身份构建研究的范畴。对虚构身份的关注也对身份研究有所贡献，因为先前的研究主要关注真实身份。未来的研究可以考虑包括诈骗艺术家的面部表情和身体动作在内的非语言线索。此外，本研究揭示的诈骗艺术家使用的五种身份显然无法涵盖中国的所有诈骗行为。未来的研究无疑会发现其他身份。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

During this time, the Jewish population in Babylon grew and became a hub of Jewish religious and scholarly activity. The social structure of the Babylonian Jewish community during the Geonic period can be understood through the following aspects: # Exilarchate: * The exilarch, also known as the Resh Galuta, held the highest position within the Babylonian Jewish community during the Geonic period. * The exilarchate was seen as a representative of the Davidic monarchy and provided a sense of spiritual and political leadership to the community. * The exilarch had authority over various religious and civil issues, including the appointment of judges and the collection of taxes. # Scholars and Rabbis: * The Geonic period was characterized by the prominence of Jewish scholars and rabbis who were highly respected and played a crucial role in religious guidance and education. * The academies or yeshivas in Babylon produced many renowned scholars who became influential in shaping Jewish law and tradition. # Pious Laypeople: * The Babylonian Jewish community consisted of pious laypeople who actively participated in religious life. * These individuals were committed to upholding Jewish traditions, observing Jewish laws, and supporting the scholars and rabbis in their community. # Occupation and Trade: * Babylonian Jews during the Geonic period engaged in various occupations and trades, reflecting their diverse roles within the society. * Some were artisans, merchants, or farmers, while others held positions in civil administration and bureaucracy. * The Babylonian Jewish community had a strong economic presence, contributing to the local economy and establishing trade networks beyond the region. # Synagogue Community: * Synagogues served as essential elements of the social structure during the Geonic period. * They were not only places of worship but also centers for communal gatherings, education, and social interactions. * Synagogue communities provided a sense of belonging, support, and cooperation among individuals, fostering a collective identity. # **Interactions with Non-Jewish Community**: * Babylonian Jews had interactions and relationships with the surrounding non-Jewish population during the Geonic period. * While there were instances of tensions and challenges, Jews were able to maintain their distinct identity and religious practices. * Jewish scholars also engaged in intellectual and cultural exchanges with Muslim and Christian scholars, contributing to a diverse and vibrant intellectual environment.

However, their realm of influence had certain limitations: # Powers of Rabbis and Scholars: - Rabbis and scholars played a central role in interpreting Jewish law and providing religious guidance to the community. - They had the authority to issue legal rulings (responsa) on various religious and legal matters. - Rabbis and scholars were responsible for the preservation and transmission of Jewish tradition and knowledge. - They had influence over communal decisions, such as the resolution of disputes and the establishment of communal practices. # Limitations on the Powers of Rabbis and Scholars: - The authority of the Rabbis and scholars was primarily limited to religious and legal matters within the Jewish community, rather than political or administrative affairs. - They did not hold political power or have direct control over civil administration. - While their opinions and teachings held great respect and influence within the community, they were not binding on individuals and communities outside of the Babylonian Jewish community. Separation of Powers: In terms of a clear separation of powers, it is important to note that during the Geonic period, the powers and authority of the Exilarch, Rabbis, and scholars were not distinctly separated like the executive, legislative, and judicial branches in modern governance systems. The roles and authority of these positions often overlapped in certain areas. However, there was a general division of authority where the Exilarch had more political and administrative powers, while the Rabbis and scholars had more religious and legal authority. The Exilarch was responsible for the leadership and administration of the community, while the Rabbis and scholars focused on matters of religious interpretation and education. Overall, although there was not a strict separation of powers, the Exilarch, Rabbis, and scholars each had their areas of influence and authority within the Babylonian Jewish community during the Geonic period."},{"instruction":"Was the Exilarch a life position?","output":"Yes, the position of Exilarch, also known as the Resh Galuta, was generally held for life during the Geonic period. Once an individual was appointed as the Exilarch, they would typically hold the position until their death. However, it's important to note that the Exilarch's position and authority were subject to the approval and recognition of the ruling authorities, particularly the Muslim authorities who governed the region. In some instances, the appointment of an Exilarch could be contested or bypassed if it didn't receive the necessary recognition from the ruling powers."},{"instruction":"输出一版 docker-compose elk 的代码","output":"版本3版本的Docker Compose文件，用于部署ELK（Elasticsearch，Logstash和Kibana）堆栈。以下是一个示例： \`\`\`yaml version: '3' services: elasticsearch: image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.12.0 container_name: elasticsearch environment: - discovery.type=single-node ports: - 9200:9200 logstash: image: docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:7.12.0 container_name: logstash volumes: - ./logstash.conf:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf depends_on: - elasticsearch kibana: image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.12.0 container_name: kibana ports: - 5601:5601 depends_on: - elasticsearch \`\`\` 以上代码定义了三个服务：Elasticsearch、Logstash和Kibana。 \`elasticsearch\`服务使用官方的Elasticsearch Docker镜像。我们将容器命名为\\"elasticsearch\\"，并将主机的9200端口映射到容器的9200端口，以便我们可以通过主机访问Elasticsearch。 \`logstash\`服务使用官方的Logstash Docker镜像。我们将容器命名为\\"logstash\\"，并将主机上的\\"logstash.conf\\"文件挂载到容器的配置文件夹以供Logstash使用。此外，它还依赖于\`elasticsearch\`服务，因此在启动Logstash之前将会启动Elasticsearch。 \`kibana\`服务使用官方的Kibana Docker镜像。我们将容器命名为\\"kibana\\"，并将主机的5601端口映射到容器的5601端口，以便我们可以通过主机访问Kibana。它也依赖于\`elasticsearch\`服务，因此在启动Kibana之前将会启动Elasticsearch。 要使用此Docker Compose文件，请将其保存为\`docker-compose.yml\`文件，然后在包含文件的目录中运行以下命令： \`\`\` docker-compose up -d \`\`\` 这将启动ELK堆栈并在后台运行。通过访问\`http://localhost:5601\`，您应该能够访问Kibana界面了。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold to organize the information] Does there exist an alternative structures of society besides statism and anarchy? Does there a kind of middle ground between the two?","output":"# Alternative Structures of Society Introduction When considering alternative structures of society, it is important to explore options beyond the two extremes of statism and anarchy. While statism advocates for a strong centralized state with extensive control and regulation, anarchy rejects any form of hierarchical authority. However, there are other forms of societal organization that can provide a middle ground between these two ideologies. Possible Alternatives Here are a few alternative structures that can offer a balance between statism and anarchy: 1. **Social Democracy**: Social democracy emphasizes a mixed economy with a balance of state intervention and free markets. It seeks to provide essential services like healthcare, education, and social welfare while still allowing for individual freedoms and a decentralized decision-making process. 2. **Communitarianism**: Communitarianism promotes a sense of community and cooperation while recognizing the importance of individual rights. It emphasizes shared values, cooperation, and civic engagement. In this structure, communities play an active role in decision-making, ensuring a decentralized form of governance. 3. **Libertarian Municipalism**: Libertarian municipalism suggests creating self-governing communities where decision-making power is decentralized. These municipalities would operate as direct democracies, allowing citizens to actively participate and contribute to the decision-making process. Key Features of the Middle Ground In exploring alternative structures between statism and anarchy, we find certain common features that contribute to a middle ground: - **Decentralization**: Allowing power and decision-making to be spread across various levels, empowering individuals and communities. - **Balancing Individual Rights and Social Welfare**: Striking a balance between protecting individual rights and promoting the overall well-being of society as a whole. - **Active Citizenry**: Encouraging citizen participation and engagement in decision-making processes through various means, such as direct democracy, community involvement, and civic education. - **Mixed Economy**: Recognizing the importance of both market mechanisms and state intervention in providing essential services and maintaining a fair and just society. Conclusion While the extreme ends of statism and anarchy dominate discussions about societal structures, it is essential to recognize that various alternatives exist. These alternatives, such as social democracy, communitarianism, and libertarian municipalism, offer a middle ground by promoting decentralization, balancing individual rights and social welfare, encouraging active citizenry, and incorporating a mixed economy. Exploring and experimenting with these alternatives can contribute to building more inclusive and just societies."},{"instruction":"Напиши содержание из пунктов и подпунктов для реферата о деревьях решешний для классификации и регресии.","output":"I.

Преимущества деревьев решений. Недостатки деревьев решений. Методы улучшения и решение проблем","output":"Преимущества деревьев решений для классификации и регрессии: 1. Интерпретируемость: Деревья решений представляют собой простую структуру, которая легко объясняется и понимается. Решения, принимаемые на основе дерева, могут быть легко интерпретированы как набор правил или условий. 2. Хорошая обработка категориальных признаков: Деревья решений могут эффективно обрабатывать категориальные признаки без необходимости проведения предварительной обработки, такой как кодирование one-hot или использование дамми-переменных. 3. Быстрая скорость обучения и предсказания: Построение дерева решений обычно требует меньше вычислительных ресурсов в сравнении с другими алгоритмами машинного обучения. Он также может выполнять предсказания очень быстро. 4. Устойчивость к шуму: Деревья решений имеют способность игнорировать шумные или нерелевантные признаки при принятии решения. Недостатки деревьев решений для классификации и регрессии: 1. Склонность к переобучению: Деревья решений могут легко переобучаться, особенно если глубина дерева слишком большая. Это может привести к неправильным предсказаниям на новых данных. 2. Неустойчивость к изменениям в данных: Деревья решений достаточно чувствительны к небольшим изменениям в данных обучения, и даже незначительное изменение данных может привести к созданию совершенно разных деревьев. 3. Проблемы с обработкой значений отсутствующих данных: Деревья решений могут иметь проблемы с обработкой пропущенных значений или значений отсутствующих данных, и часто требуют специальных методов для заполнения пропусков. Методы улучшения и решение проблем: 1. Обрезка дерева: Одним из способов снизить переобучение деревьев решений является обрезка дерева после его построения. Это означает удаление некоторых узлов или границ, которые не добавляют существенную информацию для классификации или регрессии. 2. Использование ансамблей деревьев: Использование ансамблей деревьев, таких как случайный лес или градиентный бустинг, может помочь улучшить предсказательную способность деревьев решений и уменьшить их склонность к переобучению. 3. Использование регуляризации: Добавление регуляризации в процесс построения деревьев, такое как ограничение максимальной глубины дерева или минимальное количество объектов в каждом листе, также может помочь справиться с проблемой переобучения. 4. Использование заполнения пропущенных значений: Для обработки пропущенных значений может быть использован специальный метод, такой как заполнение пропусков средним или медианным значением признака или использование модели заполнения пропусков на основе других признаков."},{"instruction":"محتاج 100 جملة تبدا بعنوان كيف لمنشوراتي بمجال التسويق الالكتروني","output":"1. كيف لمنشوراتي بمجال التسويق

Методы улучшения и решение проблем.","output":"Преимущества деревьев решений для классификации и регрессии: - Простота интерпретации: деревья решений легко читать и понимать, поскольку они представляют собой последовательность логических решений. - Эффективность: построение и использование деревьев решений может быть быстрым и эффективным, особенно при работе с небольшими и средними наборами данных. - Универсальность: деревья решений могут использоваться для решения задач как классификации, так и регрессии, что делает их мощным инструментом в анализе данных. - Обработка разнотипных данных: деревья решений способны работать с различными типами данных, включая категориальные, числовые и бинарные переменные. Недостатки деревьев решений для классификации и регрессии: - Неустойчивость к изменениям данных: небольшие изменения в данных могут привести к существенным изменениям в построенном дереве решений, что может сделать его менее точным и надежным. - Неспособность моделировать сложные зависимости: деревья решений могут иметь трудности с моделированием сложных отношений между переменными, особенно когда эти отношения являются нелинейными. - Тенденция к переобучению: деревья решений, особенно с большой глубиной, могут быть подвержены переобучению, когда они слишком точно подстраиваются под тренировочные данные и теряют способность обобщать на новые данные. Методы улучшения и решение проблем: - Ограничение глубины деревьев: ограничение максимальной глубины деревьев может снизить вероятность переобучения и улучшить их обобщающую способность. - Использование ансамблей деревьев: комбинирование нескольких деревьев решений в ансамбли (например, случайный лес) может помочь улучшить их точность и устойчивость. - Применение регуляризации: введение регуляризации может помочь снизить склонность к переобучению путем добавления штрафов на сложность модели. - Применение подходов к обработке несбалансированных данных: такие методы, как взвешивание классов или обмен весами классов, могут помочь справиться с проблемой несбалансированных классов в задаче классификации. - Использование признакового отбора: отбор наиболее информативных признаков перед построением дерева решений может помочь улучшить его точность и эффективность."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This article presents the case of a struggling company that managed to turn its fortunes around by implementing comprehensive human resources initiatives. Problem: Company XYZ, a reputable manufacturing firm, had been grappling with a decline in employee morale and an alarming turnover rate. Employees were disengaged, productivity was declining, and valuable team members were leaving for competitors. These challenges were significantly hampering the company's operations and impeding its ability to meet client demands. HR Solution: Recognizing the urgency to address the growing issues, Company XYZ sought the expertise of its HR department. The HR team meticulously analyzed the situation to identify the root causes affecting employee morale and causing turnover. They implemented a combination of strategies to address these concerns. 1. Employee Engagement Initiatives: To boost employee morale and increase job satisfaction, HR introduced various engagement initiatives. These included regular team-building activities, employee recognition programs, and open-door policies that encouraged communication between management and staff. By fostering a positive work environment, employees felt more valued and motivated, resulting in increased morale and productivity. 2. Competitive Compensation and Benefits: Company XYZ realized that offering competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits packages was vital to attracting and retaining top talent. HR conducted thorough market research to ensure that the company's salary structure aligned with industry standards.

As a result, employees were more inclined to remain with the company and demonstrated higher levels of commitment and loyalty. 3. Career Progression Opportunities: HR recognized that employees often seek growth and development opportunities within their organization. To address this, the HR team collaborated with department heads to create clear career progression pathways. They implemented mentorship programs, training sessions, and performance evaluation systems that provided employees with opportunities to enhance their skills and advance within the company. This instilled a sense of purpose and motivation among the employees, contributing to reduced turnover rates. Outcome: The implementation of these HR-driven initiatives resulted in a remarkable turnaround for Company XYZ. Employee morale significantly improved, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction. The once high turnover rate decreased, allowing the organization to retain valuable talent and lessen recruitment costs.

D - What is the total amount of overhead costs assiened to the dete mode? E - Explain the difference between the costs obtained from the traditional costing. system and the ABC system. Which system provides a better estimate of casts? Why?","output":"A - In the traditional costing system based on direct labor hours, the overhead costs are assigned proportionally to the products based on their respective direct labor hours. Standard model direct labor hours: 700 Total direct labor hours: 900 (700 + 200) Standard model overhead costs assigned: (100,000 / 900) * 700 = 77,777.78 B - Deluxe model overhead costs assigned: (100,000 / 900) * 200 = 22,222.22 C - In the activity-based costing (ABC) system, the overhead costs are assigned based on the cost drivers (number of set-ups and number of components). Total set-ups: 3 + 7 = 10 Standard model set-up cost driver rate: 30,000 / 10 = 3,000 per set-up Standard model overhead costs assigned: 3 * 3,000 = 9,000 D - Deluxe model component cost driver rate: 70,000 / 80 = 875 per component Deluxe model overhead costs assigned: 50 * 875 = 43,750 E - The traditional costing system assigns overhead costs based solely on direct labor hours, while the ABC system considers multiple cost drivers (set-ups and components) that are more closely related to the consumption of overhead resources. The ABC system provides a better estimate of costs because it takes into account the activities that actually drive overhead costs. It recognizes that different products may use overhead resources differently based on the number of set-ups and components required. This allows for a more accurate distribution of overhead costs and facilitates better decision-making regarding product pricing, profitability analysis, and resource allocation."},{"instruction":"Mammoth Earthmoving manufactures part WB23 used in several of its truck model 10 000 units are produced each year with production costs as follows Direct materials 45 000 Direct manufacturing labour Variable support costs 35 000 Fixed support costs 25 000 Total costs 120 000 15.000 Mammoth Earthmoving has the option of purchasing part W823 rom an outside supplier at 11.20 per unit If WB23 is outsourced 40% of the fixed costs cannot be immediately converted to other uses A - Describe avoidable costs. What amount of the WB23 production costs & avoidable? B - Should Mammoth Earthmoving outsource W823? Why or why not? C- What other items should Mammoth Earthmoving consider before ousouring any of the parts it currentiv manufactures?","output":"A - Avoidable costs are the costs that can be eliminated or saved if a particular activity or decision is avoided. In the case of WB23 production costs, the avoidable costs would include the direct materials, direct manufacturing labor, and variable support costs because these costs are directly tied to the production of WB23. The fixed support costs would not be considered avoidable as they cannot be immediately converted to other uses even if outsourcing occurs. Total avoidable costs of WB23 production = Direct materials + Direct manufacturing labor + Variable support costs = 45,000 + 35,000 + 15,000 = 95,000 B - To determine whether Mammoth Earthmoving should outsource W823, we need to compare the cost of producing WB23 in-house with the cost of purchasing W823 from the outside supplier. Cost of producing WB23 in-house = Total costs - Avoidable costs = 120,000 - 95,000 = 25,000 Cost of purchasing W823 = 11.20 per unit * 10,000 units = 112,000 Based on the above comparison, it is more cost-effective for Mammoth Earthmoving to outsource W823 as the cost of purchasing is lower than the cost of producing in-house. C - Before outsourcing any parts currently manufactured, Mammoth Earthmoving should consider the following factors: 1) Quality Control: They need to ensure that the quality of the outsourced part meets their standards and specifications. 2) Reliability: The reliability and reputation of the outside supplier should be evaluated to ensure they can consistently deliver the required quantity and meet the production schedule. 3) Supply Chain Impacts: Outsourcing may affect the overall supply chain, including inventory management, lead times, and transportation costs. 4) Long-term Cost and Competitive Advantage: Analyze the long-term cost implications and the impact on the company's competitive advantage. Outsourcing may result in cost savings in the short term, but it is essential to assess the potential long-term effects on cost, control, and flexibility. 5) Strategic Alignment: Consider the strategic alignment of outsourcing with the company's overall goals and objectives. By considering these factors, Mammoth Earthmoving can make informed decisions about which parts to outsource and optimize their manufacturing process."},{"instruction":"Hammond and larrett provide tax consulting for estates and tuosts Their at casting system has a single direct-cost catesonv /professional about and a singe norat cost pool research support.

B - What might be some reasons tor the him to change hun a one parts multiple-pool allocation concept?","output":"A - One reason a consulting firm might use a normal costing system rather than an actual costing system is for simplicity and ease of application. In a normal costing system, indirect costs are allocated using a predetermined overhead rate based on a single cost driver, such as professional labor hours. This allows for easier budgeting and cost estimation since the overhead rate is pre-determined and applied uniformly across all projects or services. Another reason is that actual costing systems can be more complex and time-consuming to implement. Gathering and tracking actual costs for each project or service requires detailed record-keeping and monitoring of specific cost drivers. This can be resource-intensive and may be impractical for consulting firms that deal with numerous clients and projects simultaneously. B - There could be several reasons for the consulting firm to change from a one-part multiple-pool allocation concept to a different allocation approach: 1) Cost Accuracy: The firm may find that the current allocation method does not accurately reflect the actual costs incurred for different services or projects. Changing to a more specific or refined allocation method can result in more accurate cost tracking and enable better cost control. 2) Cost Transparency: The firm may want to provide clients with a more detailed breakdown of costs for transparency and accountability purposes. Shifting to a different allocation concept that assigns costs to specific cost drivers or activities can help provide a clearer picture of how costs are incurred. 3) Cost Optimization: By using multiple-pool allocation, the firm can identify specific cost drivers or activities that contribute significantly to overall costs. This information can be used to identify areas where cost optimization strategies can be implemented, leading to potential cost savings and improved profitability. 4) Better Decision Making: A different allocation concept can provide more detailed cost information for decision-making purposes. It can help the firm assess the profitability of individual services or projects and make informed decisions about resource allocation and pricing strategies. Ultimately, the decision to change from a one-part multiple-pool allocation concept would depend on the specific needs and goals of the consulting firm, as well as the availability of data and resources to support a new allocation approach."},{"instruction":"The Winnum Corporation was recently formed to produce a semiconductor dis that forms an essential part of the personal computer manufathoredoyamar corporation.

Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.[1] Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.

Policies should minimize (if not eliminate) reuse of passwords between different user accounts, especially employees using the same credentials for personal accounts that may not be defended by enterprise security resources. M1026 Privileged Account Management Audit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. [3] [67] These audits should also include if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are created that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers. [68] M1018 User Account Management Regularly audit user accounts for activity and deactivate or remove any that are no longer needed. M1017 User Training Applications may send push notifications to verify a login as a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). Train users to only accept valid push notifications and to report suspicious push notifications. Detection ID Data Source Data Component Detects DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session Creation Monitor for newly constructed logon behavior that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access). Logon Session Metadata Look for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. DS0002 User Account User Account Authentication Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.","output":"Минимизация рисков использования данной техники злоумышленниками может осуществляться путем применения следующих программных средств и административных мероприятий: 1. Использование механизмов многофакторной аутентификации (MFA) для защиты учетных записей. Это позволит предотвратить несанкционированный доступ к учетным данным даже в случае компрометации пароля. 2. Регулярное аудирование учетных записей пользователей и деактивация учетных записей, которые больше не используются. Это поможет устранить возможность злоумышленников использовать неактивные учетные записи для получения доступа в систему. 3. Изменение паролей по умолчанию для приложений и устройств, которые используются в рабочей среде. Убедитесь, что пароли, используемые для доступа к учетным записям, длинные, сложные и уникальные. 4. Ограничение привилегий пользователей и применение принципа минимальных привилегий. Убедитесь, что каждый пользователь имеет только необходимые привилегии для выполнения своих рабочих функций, чтобы ограничить возможность распространения атаки при компрометации учетной записи. 5. Регулярное обучение пользователей основам кибербезопасности и информирование их о методах фишинга и других подобных атаках. Это поможет пользователям быть более бдительными и предотвратить компрометацию своих учетных данных. 6. Реализация мониторинга активности учетных записей и обнаружение аномальной активности. Мониторинг логов входа в систему, а также распознавание необычного поведения учетных записей пользователей (например, одновременный вход в систему с нескольких устройств или вход в систему в нерабочее время) может помочь выявить компрометацию учетных данных. 7. Продвижение использования паролей длинной и сложной, а также регулярное изменение паролей. Ресурсы для генерации и хранения уникальных паролей могут быть полезны для пользователей, чтобы избежать повторного использования паролей. 8. Использование инструментов мониторинга сетевого трафика и обнаружение аномального сетевого поведения. Мониторинг трафика может помочь выявить необычные передачи данных или попытки несанкционированного доступа к ресурсам с использованием скомпрометированной учетной записи. 9. Регулярное обновление программного обеспечения на серверах и рабочих станциях. Обновления содержат исправления уязвимостей, которые могут быть использованы злоумышленниками для компрометации учетных данных. 10. Создание сегрегированных сетевых подсетей и ограничение доступа между ними. Это поможет предотвратить распространение атаки в случае компрометации одной учетной записи. Обратите внимание, что эти меры не гарантируют полной защиты от использования данной техники злоумышленниками, но они представляют собой важные шаги по минимизации рисков и реагированию на атаки."},{"instruction":"Name two positive consequences and two negative consequences of the Internet for the public interest. Which consequence weighs most heavily in your opinion and why?","output":"Two positive consequences of the internet for the public interest are: 1. Access to information: The internet has revolutionized access to information, allowing people to easily search and find knowledge on a wide range of topics. This facilitates learning, research, and the dissemination of information, empowering individuals with a wealth of resources at their fingertips. 2. Communication and connectivity: The internet has greatly enhanced communication capabilities, enabling people across the globe to connect and interact easily. It has facilitated the growth of social media platforms, online communities, and video conferencing tools, making it easier for people to collaborate, share ideas, and foster global connections. Two negative consequences of the internet for the public interest are: 1. Information overload and misinformation: The vast amount of information available online can lead to information overload and make it difficult to discern accurate and reliable sources from misinformation and fake news. This can lead to confusion and a lack of trust in online information sources. 2. Privacy and security concerns: The internet has also brought about privacy and security issues, as personal data is increasingly collected, stored, and shared online. Cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and online surveillance can potentially compromise individuals' privacy and raise concerns about the misuse of personal information. In my opinion, the consequence that weighs most heavily is the access to information. While there are certainly negative aspects of the internet, such as misinformation and privacy concerns, the positive impact of easy access to information is immense. The ability to learn, research, and stay informed on a wide range of topics is crucial for personal growth, education, and a functioning society. With the right tools and critical thinking skills, individuals can navigate the internet successfully, sift through information, and make informed decisions."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “That’s strange…Natsuki hasn’t shown up yet.” Sayori: “She’s just out getting our snacks.

В идеальном обществе также существует конструктивный и диалогический подход к политическому разнообразию, с участием разных политических партий и мнений, и конструктивным взаимодействием между ними. Политики в таком обществе должны быть вовлечены в служение и удовлетворение интересов общества, а не преследовать личные или партийные интересы. Идеальное общество в сфере политики также стремится к социальной справедливости, где нет никакой формы дискриминации или неравенства. Защита прав меньшинств и уязвимых групп находится в центре внимания политических решений и действий. Кроме того, идеальное общество в сфере политики должно быть устойчивым и экологически ответственным. Защита окружающей среды и природных ресурсов является приоритетом, а политические решения принимаются с учетом их долгосрочных последствий для экологической устойчивости и благосостояния будущих поколений. Наконец, идеальное общество в сфере политики стремится к международному сотрудничеству и миру.

In order to enhance my customer service skills and potentially become a customer service manager in a retail outlet, I have identified a number of areas that require improvement. Firstly, I recognize that one of my strengths lies in my ability to communicate effectively with customers. However, I acknowledge that there is room for improvement in terms of my active listening skills. To address this, I plan to enroll in a workshop or online course on active listening techniques within the next three months. This will not only provide me with the necessary knowledge and skills, but it will also demonstrate my initiative and commitment to personal growth. Secondly, I understand that my weakness lies in my ability to remain calm and composed in challenging customer situations. To strengthen this area, I intend to practice mindfulness and stress management techniques. This can be achieved by allocating 15 minutes each day to engage in activities such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or journaling. I will also seek guidance from a mentor or supervisor to learn how to effectively manage difficult customer interactions. Furthermore, I have identified the need to expand my product knowledge. While I possess a basic understanding of the products we offer, I recognize that in-depth knowledge is crucial for delivering exceptional customer service. To address this, I will allocate 30 minutes per day to study product brochures, attend training sessions, and utilize online resources. I will also make an effort to engage with knowledgeable colleagues and seek clarification on any uncertainties I may have. This proactive approach to learning will not only enhance my customer service skills, but it will also demonstrate my commitment to providing accurate information to customers. In order to gauge the effectiveness of my development plan, I will regularly assess my performance in customer service situations. This can be done by seeking feedback from customers, supervisors, and colleagues. By reviewing the feedback, I will be able to identify areas of improvement and make any necessary adjustments to my development plan. Additionally, I will set specific goals to measure the progress made in each area. For example, within six months, my goal is to receive positive feedback from at least 90% of customer interactions, indicating that my customer service skills have significantly improved. Overall, this development plan will enhance my customer service and communication skills by addressing specific areas for improvement. Through proactive learning, obtaining feedback, and setting measurable goals, I will be able to monitor my progress and demonstrate initiative in making high-quality decisions for my future career growth. By implementing this plan, I am confident that my performance in customer service will improve, increasing my potential to become a customer service manager in a retail outlet."},{"instruction":"用中文介绍wood look aluminium batten的定义","output":"木纹铝镗条（wood look aluminium batten）是一种用铝材制作，外观呈现出木材纹理的建筑装饰材料。它的外观设计模仿了真实的木材纹理，但采用了耐用易维护的铝材料，具有较高的抗腐蚀性和耐久性。木纹铝镗条可在室内和室外两种环境中使用，可用于墙壁、天花板、栏杆等不同部位的装饰。此外，木纹铝镗条还具有防火、防水、易清洁等特点，能够为建筑空间带来自然、优雅的木纹效果，同时不需额外的保养和维修工作。因此，木纹铝镗条已广泛应用于商业、住宅和公共建筑等多个领域，成为一种时尚、实用的建筑装饰材料。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Wood Look Aluminium Cladding的定义","output":"木纹铝幕墙（Wood Look Aluminium Cladding）是一种采用铝材制作的建筑装饰材料，具有木材质感的外观设计。它通过特殊的制作工艺，使铝材表面呈现出逼真的木纹纹理，从而在外观上模拟出木质材料的效果。木纹铝幕墙既能给建筑物带来自然、温暖的木纹外观，又具备铝材的优势特性，如抗腐蚀性、耐久性和易于维护等。木纹铝幕墙适用于住宅、商业建筑等不同类型的建筑物外墙装饰，可在各种气候条件下使用，并且具有良好的防火性能。此外，它还能够满足设计师对于建筑外观的创意需求，提供多种颜色、纹理和样式供选择，从而实现个性化的建筑装饰效果。木纹铝幕墙因其结合了木材的美感和铝材的耐用性，已成为现代建筑中受欢迎的装饰材料之一。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Wood Look Aluminium Slats的定义","output":"木纹铝条（Wood Look Aluminium Slats）是一种利用铝材制作的建筑装饰材料，其外观模仿了木材质感。木纹铝条由铝材制成，表面经过特殊工艺处理，呈现出逼真的木纹纹理，以达到与真正木材相似的效果。木纹铝条具有铝材的优势，如防腐蚀性、耐用性和易于维护。与木材相比，它具有更好的抗水、耐火和耐候性能。木纹铝条可应用于室内和室外的墙壁、栏杆、百叶窗以及其他装饰应用中。它适用于住宅、商业或公共建筑，并能在多种气候条件下使用。木纹铝条不仅具备木材的外观，而且不需要额外的保养和维修工作，同时抗火和防水性能更高，使其成为一种时尚、实用的建筑装饰材料。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Wood Look Aluminum Soffit的定义","output":"木纹铝悬垂板（Wood Look Aluminum Soffit）是一种具有木纹质感的铝制屋檐板材。它通过采用铝合金材料，并经过特殊的工艺处理，使表面呈现出真实的木纹纹理。木纹铝悬垂板既拥有木材的自然质感，又具备铝材的耐久性和易维护性。它通常用于建筑物的屋面下悬垂部位，如屋檐、挑檐等。木纹铝悬垂板具有出色的耐腐蚀性、防火性和抗水性能，能够在不同的气候条件下使用。此外，它还提供多种颜色和纹理的选择，以满足设计和装饰要求。木纹铝悬垂板不仅能够为建筑物增添自然、优雅的外观效果，还能够提供有效的保护和隔热性能，是一种功能性与美观性兼具的建筑装饰材料。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Преимущества деревьев решений: 1. Простота интерпретации: Деревья решений легко понять и интерпретировать. Решение представляется в виде иерархической структуры, состоящей из узлов и листьев, что делает его понятным даже для неспециалистов. 2. Универсальность: Деревья решений могут использоваться для решения задач классификации и регрессии. Они могут быть применены к различным типам данных, включая категориальные и числовые переменные. 3. Эффективность по времени выполнения: Деревья решений могут быть быстро построены и использованы для прогнозирования новых данных. Они не требуют сложных вычислений или итераций, поэтому могут быть использованы для обработки больших объемов данных. 4. Работа с несбалансированными данными: Деревья решений показывают хорошую производительность при работе с несбалансированными данными, где один класс встречается намного реже, чем другой. Они могут легко предсказать миноритарный класс, не требуя дополнительных операций. 5. Малое количество предварительной обработки данных: Деревья решений могут работать с неполными или отсутствующими данными без каких-либо негативных последствий. B. Недостатки деревьев решений: 1. Склонность к переобучению: Деревья решений могут с легкостью переобучаться, особенно когда глубина дерева слишком большая. Это может привести к низкой обобщающей способности модели и плохим результатам при прогнозировании новых данных. 2. Нестабильность: Малые изменения в данных могут привести к существенным изменениям в структуре дерева решений. Из-за этого деревья решений могут быть нестабильными и чувствительными к случайным вариациям данных. 3. Трудности в обработке многомерных данных: Деревья решений могут плохо справляться с данными, имеющими большое число признаков или многомерные пространства. В таких случаях может возникнуть проблема переобучения или низкой обобщающей способности модели. C. Методы улучшения и решение проблем: 1. Ограничение глубины дерева: Одним из способов устранения проблемы переобучения является ограничение глубины дерева. Это позволяет модели лучше обобщать данные и предотвращает ее чувствительность к случайным вариациям. 2. Применение ансамблевых методов: Методы ансамбля, такие как случайный лес или градиентный бустинг, могут существенно улучшить стабильность и точность деревьев решений. Они комбинируют предсказания нескольких деревьев, что позволяет уменьшить вероятность ошибок и повысить обобщающую способность модели. 3. Применение регуляризации: Регуляризация может использоваться для уменьшения переобучения деревьев решений. Это может быть достигнуто через различные методы, такие как обрезка дерева, использование меры важности переменных или применение снижения шума. 4. Использование кросс-валидации: Кросс-валидация может использоваться для оценки и выбора оптимальных параметров модели. Это помогает уменьшить переобучение и улучшить обобщающую способность модели. 5. Предобработка данных: Предварительная обработка данных может быть полезным шагом для улучшения производительности деревьев решений. Это может включать в себя удаление выбросов, масштабирование признаков или устранение пропущенных значений."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Описание и анализ техники Valid Accounts Техника Valid Accounts описывает способность злоумышленников получить и злоупотреблять учетными данными существующих аккаунтов для получения начального доступа, закрепления, повышения привилегий или обхода защитного механизма. Скомпрометированные учетные данные могут использоваться для обхода контроля доступа к различным ресурсам в системах внутри сети, а также для постоянного доступа к удаленным системам и службам, таким как VPN, Outlook Web Access, сетевые устройства и RDP. В некоторых случаях злоумышленники могут злоупотреблять неактивными аккаунтами, например, принадлежащими лицам, которые больше не являются частью организации. Использование этих аккаунтов может позволить злоумышленнику избежать обнаружения, так как владелец оригинального аккаунта не будет присутствовать, чтобы обнаружить любую аномальную активность, происходящую в их аккаунте. Техника Valid Accounts имеет следующие подтехники: T1078.001, T1078.002, T1078.003, T1078.004. Эта техника может быть использована в тактиках: Defense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access. Техника Valid Accounts была использована следующими группировками: APT18, APT28, APT29, APT33, APT39, APT41, Axiom, Carbanak, Chimera, Dragonfly, Dtrack, Duqu, FIN10, FIN4, FIN5, FIN6, FIN7, FIN8, Fox Kitten, GALLIUM, Industroyer, Ke3chang, Kinsing, LAPSUS, Lazarus Group, Leviathan, Linux Rabbit, menuPass, Night Dragon, OilRig, Operation Wocao, PittyTiger, POLONIUM, Sandworm Team, SeaDuke, Silence, Silent Librarian, SolarWinds Compromise, Suckfly, TEMP.Veles, Threat Group-3390, Wizard Spider. Предлагаемое решение по минимизации рисков Для минимизации рисков, связанных с использованием техники Valid Accounts, рекомендуется следующие решения по минимизации рисков: 1. Политики использования аккаунтов: Внедрение строгих политик использования аккаунтов, таких как использование паролей сложных для отгадывания и периодическая смена паролей. Администраторам не следует использовать учетную запись администратора домена для выполнения административных задач. 2. Конфигурация Active Directory: Отключение устаревшей аутентификации, которая не поддерживает многоразовую аутентификацию, и требование использования современных протоколов аутентификации. Также необходимо регулярно проводить аудит аккаунтов и их разрешений, чтобы обнаружить потенциальные уязвимости. 3. Безопасная разработка приложений: Необходимо добиться того, чтобы в коде приложений не хранились чувствительные данные или учетные данные в небезопасном виде, таком как пароли, опубликованные учетные данные в репозиториях или учетные данные в публичном облачном хранилище. Регулярная проверка и обновление приложений для обеспечения безопасности Подбор программных средств и/или административных мероприятий Для обнаружения использования техники Valid Accounts следует следить за созданием новых сессий входа в систему, мониторировать активность учетных записей и аутентификацию пользователей. Минимизация рисков использования данной техники злоумышленниками может осуществляться путем применения следующих программных средств и административных мероприятий: 1. Использование механизмов многофакторной аутентификации (MFA) для защиты учетных записей. Это позволит предотвратить несанкционированный доступ к учетным данным даже в случае компрометации пароля. 2. Регулярное аудирование учетных записей пользователей и деактивация учетных записей, которые больше не используются. Это поможет устранить возможность злоумышленников использовать неактивные учетные записи для получения доступа в систему. 3. Изменение паролей по умолчанию для приложений и устройств, которые используются в рабочей среде. Убедитесь, что пароли, используемые для доступа к учетным записям, длинные, сложные и уникальные. 4. Ограничение привилегий пользователей и применение принципа минимальных привилегий. Убедитесь, что каждый пользователь имеет только необходимые привилегии для выполнения своих рабочих функций, чтобы ограничить возможность распространения атаки при компрометации учетной записи. 5. Регулярное обучение пользователей основам информационной безопасности и и информирование их о методах фишинга и других подобных атаках. Это поможет пользователям быть более бдительными и предотвратить компрометацию своих учетных данных. 6. Реализация мониторинга активности учетных записей и обнаружение аномальной активности. Мониторинг логов входа в систему, а также распознавание необычного поведения учетных записей пользователей (например, одновременный вход в систему с нескольких устройств, вход в систему в нерабочее время, вход с постороннего ip-адреса) может помочь выявить компрометацию учетных данных. 7. Продвижение использования паролей длинной и сложной, а также регулярное изменение паролей. Ресурсы для генерации и хранения уникальных паролей могут быть полезны для пользователей, чтобы избежать повторного использования паролей. 8. Использование инструментов мониторинга сетевого трафика и обнаружение аномального сетевого поведения. Мониторинг трафика может помочь выявить необычные передачи данных или попытки несанкционированного доступа к ресурсам с использованием скомпрометированной учетной записи. 9. Регулярное обновление программного обеспечения на серверах и рабочих станциях. Обновления содержат исправления уязвимостей, которые могут быть использованы злоумышленниками для компрометации учетных данных.","output":"Да, это релевантно в области облачной безопасности.

This symbolism is found in various stories and events mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. For example, Moses led the Israelites in the wilderness for 40 years before they reached the Promised Land. This is considered a symbolic period of time representing a generation's journey and the testing of their faith and commitment. Similarly, in the story of Noah and the flood, it rained for 40 days and 40 nights, which is seen as a symbolic period of purification and preparation.

Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold to organize the information] Is Judaism more decentralized than Christianity?","output":"# Comparing Decentralization in Judaism and Christianity Introduction Decentralization refers to the distribution of power and authority within a religious framework. When comparing Judaism and Christianity, it is important to consider various aspects of their religious structures in terms of decentralization. Here, we will explore key elements to understand the level of decentralization in each religion. Judaism Judaism is known for its historical emphasis on communal and individual responsibilities, which can contribute to a more decentralized structure. # Community Involvement - **Synagogues**: Jewish communal worship primarily takes place in synagogues, where local leaders and members play an active role. - **Rabbis**: Local rabbis hold significant influence within their communities and play a central role in interpreting Jewish law and providing guidance. # Decision-Making - **Halakha**: Jewish law, or Halakha, is determined by religious legal authorities, such as rabbis and scholars. This decentralized decision-making process allows local Jewish communities to adapt religious practices to their specific needs. - **Responsa Literature**: The tradition of responsa, where rabbinic scholars provide answers to specific legal and ethical questions, further allows for decentralized decision-making. # Diversity - **Denominational Differences**: Judaism encompasses various denominations, including Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and others. Each denomination has its own interpretation of Jewish practices and beliefs, contributing to a diversified and decentralized religious landscape. Christianity Christianity, in contrast to Judaism, tends to have a more centralized structure due to its historical influences and hierarchies. # Church Hierarchy - **Papal Authority**: In Roman Catholicism, the Pope holds significant centralized authority over church doctrine and the interpretation of biblical teachings. - **Episcopal Systems**: Many Christian denominations have a hierarchical structure consisting of bishops, archbishops, and other church leaders who maintain a centralized decision-making process. # Centralized Doctrine - **Creeds and Councils**: Christianity has a long history of formalizing its beliefs through creeds and ecumenical councils, often leading to a more centralized approach to theology and doctrine. # Denominational Variations - While Christianity has denominational variations similar to Judaism, the centralized authority of certain denominations often contributes to a more unified religious structure compared to Judaism. Conclusion While Judaism and Christianity both exhibit elements of decentralization and centralization, it can be generally argued that Judaism tends to be more decentralized in terms of communal involvement, decision-making, and denominational diversity. Christianity, on the other hand, leans toward a more centralized structure due to historical developments, hierarchical systems, and centralized doctrine."},{"instruction":"intervention/activity plan for to continue to build his home-living skills, such as being supported to carry out light domestic activities e.g., washing/ drying dishes, and hanging clothes on the washing line.

This opinion is reasonable, and you can explain the advantages of this textbook for course learning to everyone, recommending everyone to purchase it, just like many other mandatory courses. However, it can only be a suggestion and cannot be included in the course syllabus. Because a mandatory project is not truly fair, it only appears fair because everyone has to do it. Students are adults, and even if a book is excellent and perfect, professors do not need to do the work for them, but rather let them make their own choices. Additionally, I fully agree that continuous assessment should be implemented in the course to help students learn. But just like many courses design quizzes without relying on textbooks, BUS1104 can also be independent of textbooks. No matter how much a book can help students succeed, it cannot leave them with no choice. If you think adjusting the grading scheme now is unfair to students who have already purchased e-books, I completely understand. We can start implementing it from next semester's BUS1104, and I hope future students will have more freedom of choice. After all, this is not an individual case. I consulted many people before deciding to send this email. Most students remain silent not because they have no complaints but because they do not believe they can help improve the course or they exaggerate the consequences of \\"providing feedback\\" and even fear potential negative effects. Even if there are such negative effects, I still need to take the risk and provide feedback. Although professors are very responsible, they cannot see some problems from the perspective of students, and we need to communicate. Finally, the suggestions I provided always represent the majority of students' perspectives and also consider the course designs of other mandatory courses in our school. I sincerely hope that our business school courses can continue to improve."},{"instruction":"Brief description of a commercial office building with 10 floors","output":"A commercial office building with 10 floors is a high-rise structure designed to accommodate multiple businesses and their offices.

It is a global phenomenon and is driven by various factors, including population growth, rural-to-urban migration, and economic development. As countries become more developed, there is often a shift from an agrarian-based economy to an industrialized and service-based economy. This transition typically leads to the concentration of economic activities in urban areas, attracting people in search of better job opportunities, education, and healthcare services. As a result, urban areas grow in population and in physical size. Urbanization has both positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, urban areas tend to offer better access to jobs, education, healthcare, and other essential services. They also provide opportunities for social and cultural interactions, innovation, and economic growth. Urbanization can also contribute to improved infrastructure, such as transportation systems, housing, and public utilities. However, urbanization also presents challenges. Rapid population growth in urban areas can strain resources and infrastructure, leading to issues such as overcrowding, slums, inadequate housing, and traffic congestion. It can also result in increased pollution, both in terms of air and water quality, as well as the depletion of natural resources. Social issues like inequality, poverty, and crime can also be exacerbated in urban areas. To mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization, urban planning and development strategies are crucial. These include efficient land use planning, building sustainable infrastructure, providing affordable housing, promoting public transportation, ensuring access to basic services, and creating green spaces. Additionally, governments need to invest in education, social welfare, and employment generation programs to address the challenges associated with rapid urbanization. Overall, urbanization is a complex and ongoing process that has profound impacts on societies, economies, and the environment. Proper management of urbanization is essential for creating thriving, inclusive, and sustainable cities and towns."},{"instruction":"Rate and Level of Urbanization explained","output":"The rate and level of urbanization can be described as the speed and extent, respectively, at which a country or region is experiencing urban growth. The rate of urbanization refers to how quickly the urban population is growing in relation to the total population. It is usually measured as the annual percentage change in the urban population. A high rate of urbanization indicates a rapid increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas, while a low rate signifies a slower pace of urban growth. Factors that influence the rate of urbanization include natural population growth, rural-to-urban migration, and government policies. Higher fertility rates and reduced mortality rates can contribute to a higher rate of urbanization, as can the movement of people from rural areas seeking economic opportunities, better living conditions, and improved access to services. The level of urbanization refers to the proportion of the total population living in urban areas. It is typically measured as the percentage of people residing in cities or towns compared to those in rural areas. A higher level of urbanization indicates a larger urban population relative to the total population. The level of urbanization varies greatly among countries and regions. More developed countries tend to have higher levels of urbanization, as their economies are often more highly industrialized and urban-focused. In contrast, developing countries generally have lower levels of urbanization, but they may experience rapid urban growth as they undergo economic and social transformations. Both the rate and level of urbanization have significant implications for social, economic, and environmental dynamics. Rapid urbanization can pose challenges in terms of housing, infrastructure, and social services, as well as environmental sustainability. It also affects resource allocation, job creation, income distribution, and access to education and healthcare. Understanding the rate and level of urbanization helps policymakers and urban planners analyze demographic trends, anticipate future needs, and develop appropriate strategies to manage urban growth effectively. This includes implementing sustainable urban development plans, improving infrastructure and basic services, promoting inclusive growth, and addressing social and environmental issues associated with urbanization."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(желательно со ссылками)","output":"Услуга WebGL (с использованием Three.js) может быть интересна для различных видов веб-приложений и интерактивных визуализаций, которые требуют более сложной и реалистичной графики, чем стандартные 2D-решения. Вот некоторые примеры, где использование WebGL может быть полезно: 1. Визуализация продукта или услуги: Вы можете создать интерактивную 3D-модель продукта или услуги, позволяющую посетителям вашего веб-сайта полностью осмотреть и рассмотреть объект со всех сторон. Например, компания Tesla использует WebGL для визуализации своих автомобилей на своем веб-сайте. [Пример](https://www.tesla.com/models/design) 2. Архитектурная визуализация: Вы можете создать виртуальный тур по зданию или помещению, чтобы потенциальные клиенты могли лучше представить себе пространство. Например, [этот проект](https://awards.architizer.com/winners-gallery/?id=11) демонстрирует использование WebGL для визуализации архитектурных проектов. 3. Обучение и образование: Вы можете создать интерактивные образовательные материалы, которые помогут студентам лучше понять сложные концепции. Например, [этот проект](https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/lasers/) использовал WebGL для создания интерактивной визуализации лазеров и их воздействия на атомы. 4. Виртуальные туры и путешествия: Вы можете создать виртуальное путешествие по конкретному месту или всему миру, чтобы пользователи могли исследовать различные места. Например, [Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/) использует WebGL для создания виртуальных туров по музеям и культурным памятникам. 5. Визуализация данных: Если вам нужно визуализировать большие объемы данных или сложные графики, WebGL может быть очень полезным. Например, [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/) использует WebGL для визуализации данных о мировых трендах и статистике. Это только некоторые примеры применения WebGL (Three.js) в веб-дизайне.

She uses this power to get out of a speeding ticket by turning into something appealing to the policeman who comes to the car window.","output":"Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Cedarbrook, there lived a young woman named Amelia. Amelia possessed a remarkable power, unknown to the rest of the world – the ability to transform herself at will. However, she was not one to exploit her gift for personal gain or mischief, as her heart was filled with compassion and kindness. Little did she know that this extraordinary ability would soon come to her aid during an unexpected encounter. One bright and sunny morning, as Amelia drove along the highway, her speed got the best of her. Unbeknownst to her, a police officer named Officer Johnson stealthily watched her car's velocity increase as it zoomed past him. He activated his siren, and as the flashing red and blue lights flickered behind her car, Amelia's heart raced with anxiety. Pulling over to the side of the road, Amelia rolled her window down and braced herself for the consequences of her actions. Officer Johnson, a stern yet fair officer, approached Amelia's vehicle. However, as he reached the car window, a shiver of curiosity ran down Amelia's spine, prompting her to briefly consider using her transformative power. With a deep breath, Amelia willed herself to transform into an elegant and exotic peacock. In the blink of an eye, her body shifted, shimmering feathers branching out from her skin, and vivid hues of blue and green replaced her ordinary appearance. Amelia now sat before Officer Johnson, a stunning and alluring sight. Startled and captivated by the unexpected transformation, Officer Johnson felt a momentary sense of fascination envelope him. The mystical beauty of the peacock thoroughly distracted him from the task at hand, causing his stern expression to dissolve into awe and surprise. Mesmerized by the sight before him, he couldn't help but lose track of the speeding ticket he had initially intended to issue. \\"Wow,\\" Officer Johnson exclaimed, his voice tinged with amazement. \\"I've never seen anything like this before!\\" Meanwhile, Amelia, still in her peacock form, cleverly decided to seize this opportunity to charm the officer with her unique gift. Exuding grace and elegance, Amelia, now the peacock, stretched her vibrant feathers and began a rhythmic dance, captivating Officer Johnson's attention even more. With every twist and turn, she evoked a sense of wonder and enchantment, as though an artist had painted the sky directly upon her magnificent plumes. The officer's initial intent seemed forgotten as Amelia continued her mesmerizing display. The peacock's enchanting dance imbued Officer Johnson with a joyful ambience, creating an atmosphere of awe and magic. As dusk settled upon the horizon, Amelia could sense the officer's outlook gradually shifting from skepticism to pure wonderment. In that moment, both Amelia and Officer Johnson exchanged understanding glances, recognizing a fleeting connection that transcended the ordinary boundaries of human comprehension. They shared a silent understanding, acknowledging the power of beauty, both inside and out. Eventually, the dance concluded, and Amelia's true form reappeared before Officer Johnson's eyes. Slightly dazed, he handed her a warning instead of the anticipated speeding ticket. With a gentle voice and a grateful smile, Amelia thanked the officer for his kindness, and he reciprocated with a nod and a hint of amazement still twinkling in his eyes. As Amelia gracefully drove away, she understood the significance of her transformative abilities. It was not simply a tool for evading consequences, but rather a gift to inspire moments of connection and wonder in those around her – to remind the world of the beauty that resides within every soul. From that day forward, Amelia continued to embark on countless adventures, using her extraordinary gift to captivate hearts, spark conversations, and inspire the magnificent and extraordinary moments that reside within the seemingly mundane."},{"instruction":"How to protect the Earth The Earth is our home, and we should protect it.

Tiene múltiples sentidos de interpretación como famosa imaginería espacial. Borges explica que es la primera letra del alfabeto hebreo y que también es un punto que se puede abarcar, descrito concretamente como un pequeño orbe brillante de dos o tres centímetros de diámetro, a través del cual se puede ver el mundo entero. El espacio cósmico está todo englobado en él, y el volumen no se reduce. \\"Vi vastos océanos, amaneceres y atardeceres, multitudes en América, una tela de araña plateada en el centro de una pirámide negra, un laberinto en ruinas (eso era Londres) ...\\" , \\"Vi un globo terráqueo entre dos espejos en una habitación de Alkmaar, reflejándose mutuamente hasta el infinito\\". Descripciones repetidas hasta la enumeración de innumerables espacios geográficos. Al final de el cuento, es como si el protagonista, \\"yo\\", ya no pudiera expresar sus sentimientos por escrito, puede ver el universo con claridad desde cualquier ángulo: \\"...vi mi cara y mis vísceras, vi tu cara, y sentí vértigo y lloré, porque mis ojos habían visto ese objeto secreto y conjetural, cuyo nombre usurpan los hombres, pero que ningún hombre ha mirado: el inconcebible universo.\\"[ Luis Jorge Borges: \\"El Aleph\\", Vintage Español, 2012] Da el mayor salto geográfico posible con \\"El Aleph\\", un cuento de carácter de ciencia ficción que podría calificarse de la más disparatada crónica de viaje, si de una excursión se tratara. En la escritura de Borges fluye una visión fantástica del espacio, la del laberinto. El espacio de Borges no es sólido, se colapsa y se expande, y si uno encuentra el lugar adecuado para observarlo, tiene incluso la oportunidad de reconocer toda la extensión del espacio, y es entonces cuando el observador comprende ante qué universo laberíntico nos encontramos. Si comparamos el espacio cósmico con la vieja idea de una serpiente que se come su propia cola, entonces el Aleph es la parte de la cola de la serpiente que está contenida en la lengua. Si además imaginamos que esta serpiente es casi transparente, entonces el funcionamiento interno de la cabeza, el espacio más grande, puede verse en la más pequeña de las colas de la serpiente. Pero verla no significa que se pueda salir del laberinto, sino que se está en el punto más alejado de la salida del universo. Por eso el laberinto de Borges es tan estremecedor y desesperadamente frustrante.","output":"Aleph comes from the title of Borges' famous work \\"El Aleph.\\" It has multiple layers of interpretation, much like famous spatial imagery. Borges explains that it is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and that it is also a point that can be encompassed, specifically described as a small, bright orb two or three centimeters in diameter, through which one can see the entire world. The cosmic space is all encompassed within it, and the volume does not diminish. \\"I saw vast oceans, sunrises and sunsets, crowds in America, a silver spiderweb in the center of a black pyramid, a ruined labyrinth (that was London)...\\", \\"I saw a globe between two mirrors in a room in Alkmaar, reflecting each other infinitely.\\" Descriptions repeated up to the enumeration of countless geographic spaces. At the end of the story, it's as if the protagonist, \\"I\\", can no longer express his feelings in writing, he can see the universe clearly from any angle: \\"...I saw my face and my entrails, I saw your face, and I felt dizzy and cried, because my eyes had seen that secret and conjectural object, whose name men usurp, but that no man has looked at: the inconceivable universe.\\" [Luis Jorge Borges: \\"El Aleph\\", Vintage Español, 2012] \\"The Aleph\\" takes the biggest geographical leap possible, a science fiction story that could be described as the most outrageous chronicle of a journey, if it were an excursion. In Borges' writing, there flows a fantastic vision of space, that of the labyrinth. Borges' space is not solid, it collapses and expands, and if one finds the right place to observe it, there is even the opportunity to recognize the entire expanse of space, and it is then that the observer understands what labyrinthine universe we find ourselves in. If we compare cosmic space to the old idea of a snake eating its own tail, then the Aleph is the part of the snake's tail that is contained in the tongue. If we also imagine that this snake is almost transparent, then the inner workings of the head, the larger space, can be seen in the smallest of the snake's tails. But seeing it does not mean one can escape the labyrinth; rather, it means one is at the farthest point from the exit of the universe. That's why Borges' labyrinth is so unsettling and desperately frustrating."},{"instruction":"将下列翻译成英语：Este juego de laberintos aparece repetidamente en los escritos de Borges, por ejemplo en \\"La biblioteca de Babel\\" y \\"Los dos reyes y los dos laberintos\\".

Y lo que nos dice \\"El Aleph\\" es que, aunque veas todo el mapa del laberinto, es imposible encontrar la salida del mismo.","output":"This game of labyrinths appears repeatedly in Borges' writings, for example in \\"The Library of Babel\\" and \\"The Two Kings and the Two Labyrinths.\\" In these novels, there are artificial labyrinths, natural labyrinths, legendary labyrinths, etc., to show that ultimately they are nothing more than symbols, that the current world itself is the greatest labyrinth in which we are trapped with no way out. And what \\"The Aleph\\" tells us is that, even if you see the entire map of the labyrinth, it is impossible to find its exit."},{"instruction":"将下列翻译成英语：La función más básica de un espejo es reflejar el mundo exterior, y la realización de esta función se basa en la reproducción de las apariencias. La función de reproducción de los espejos fue descubierta ya por los antiguos griegos, como menciona explícitamente Platón en su obra El Estado Ideal: \\"Toma un espejo y hazlo girar en todas direcciones, e inmediatamente crearás el sol, las estrellas, la tierra, a ti mismo, a otros animales, utensilios, plantas y árboles, y todas las cosas que acabamos de mencionar. \\" Aunque este pasaje se cita a menudo como un argumento clásico a favor de la mímesis, la intención original del texto con el ejemplo del espejo es subrayar la función de reproducción del espejo, creando algo externo exactamente igual al original, es decir, reproduciendo una serie de apariencias a través del espejo. El espejo modela el espacio infinitamente; al iluminar el mundo exterior, difumina los límites del espacio, creando un espacio idéntico. Y en el espacio reproducido existen las mismas personas y cosas que en el espacio original. El jardín de senteros que se bifurcan no es un laberinto generado al azar, no es un \\"jardín aristocrático\\" sinuoso e irregular, sino más bien dos espejos colocados uno frente al otro, y en el mismo momento en que se fija la posición, innumerables espejos se reflejan el uno en el otro, y estos espejos anidados el uno en el otro construyen una relación de \\"reflexión-reflejo\\" en el espejo, que se extiende hasta las \\"profundidades\\" del espejo, realizando así la \\"infinitud del espacio\\" que se puede alcanzar con sólo dos espejos. Un espacio así es, sin duda, un rompecabezas difícil y oscuro para Yu Tsun, personaje considerado como la persona del espejo. \\"La vida humana tiene un destino muy diferente en un 'espejo' debido a la multiplicación infinita de espejos, pero el 'espejo' en el que vive Yu Tsun es singular y no está enriquecido, característica que oscurece sus posibilidades de ver otras posibilidades. Esta propiedad oscurece sus posibilidades de ver otras posibilidades. La situación cambia cuando Yu Tsun entra en el Jardín, donde los caminos se bifurcan, y es sacado del espejo por el manuscrito de El Jardín, y como observador que mira en ambos espejos prolifera perpetuamente la imagen especular, como dice Borges en su conversación con Coffa: \\"Creo que la imagen humana y la imagen en el espejo son igualmente irreales e igualmente reales. Creo que la imagen humana y la imagen en el espejo son igualmente irreales e igualmente reales. Los espejos y el coito son la misma cosa. Ambos crean la imagen, no la realidad\\"[ 威利斯·巴恩斯通：《博尔赫斯谈话录》，广西师范大学出版社，2014年]. No podemos decir si el yo del espejo es el yo real o si el \\"yo\\" fuera del espejo es el \\"yo\\" real, pero esa única imagen del yo existe visiblemente.","output":"The most basic function of a mirror is to reflect the outer world, and the realization of this function is based on the reproduction of appearances. The function of reproducing mirrors was already discovered by the ancient Greeks, as explicitly mentioned by Plato in his work The Ideal State: \\"Take a mirror and turn it in all directions, and immediately you will create the sun, the stars, the earth, yourself, other animals, utensils, plants, and trees, and all the things we just mentioned.\\" Although this passage is often cited as a classical argument in favor of mimesis, the original intention of the text with the example of the mirror is to underline the mirror's function of reproduction, creating something external exactly like the original, that is, reproducing a series of appearances through the mirror. The mirror models space infinitely; by illuminating the outer world, it blurs the boundaries of space, creating an identical space. And in the reproduced space, the same people and things as in the original space exist. The garden of forking paths is not a randomly generated maze; it is not a winding and irregular \\"aristocratic garden,\\" but rather two mirrors placed opposite each other, and at the very moment the position is fixed, countless mirrors reflect each other, and these nested mirrors construct a \\"reflection-reflected\\" relationship in the mirror, extending to the \\"depths\\" of the mirror, thus realizing the \\"infinitude of space\\" that can be reached with just two mirrors. Such a space is undoubtedly a difficult and obscure puzzle for Yu Tsun, a character considered the person of the mirror. \\"Human life has a very different fate in a 'mirror' due to the infinite multiplication of mirrors, but the 'mirror' in which Yu Tsun lives is singular and impoverished, a characteristic that obscures his possibilities of seeing other possibilities. This property obscures his possibilities of seeing other possibilities. The situation changes when Yu Tsun enters the Garden, where the paths fork, and he is drawn out of the mirror by the manuscript of The Garden, and as an observer looking into both mirrors, perpetually proliferating the mirror image, as Borges says in his conversation with Coffa: \\"I believe that the human image and the image in the mirror are equally unreal and equally real.

Минимизация повторяющихся операций: проверьте, есть ли в коде повторяющиеся операции, которые можно вынести в отдельные функции или методы. Например, повторяющийся блок кода для обновления истории цен можно вынести в отдельную функцию. 2. Использование объектов и массивов: если в коде присутствуют повторяющиеся переменные с похожими значениями, можно объединить их в один объект или массив. Например, вместо использования отдельных переменных \`bestBidPrice\` и \`bestAskPrice\`, можно использовать объект \`spread\`, в котором будут храниться оба значения. 3. Разделение функций на более мелкие и управление сложными операциями: если некоторые функции выполняют слишком много операций, их можно разделить на более мелкие функции, которые будут выполнять только одну определенную задачу. Это поможет улучшить читаемость и поддерживаемость кода. 4. Кеширование результатов: если некоторые операции выполняются с большими объемами данных или требуют значительных вычислительных ресурсов, можно использовать кеширование результатов, чтобы избежать повторных вычислений. 5. Использование асинхронных операций: если в вашем коде есть длительные операции, которые блокируют основной поток выполнения, можно использовать асинхронные операции или веб-воркеры для их выполнения в фоновом режиме. 6. Удаление неиспользуемого кода: проверьте, есть ли в коде неиспользуемые переменные, функции или блоки кода. Их удаление поможет сделать код более чистым и понятным. Это лишь некоторые из подходов, которые можно использовать для оптимизации кода.
