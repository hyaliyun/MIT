If Chris went fishing 10 times, then Brian, who goes fishing twice as often, went fishing 2 * 10 = 20 times. The total number of fish Chris caught is 10 * C = 10C. The total number of fish Brian caught is 20 * (3/5C) = 12C. Together, they caught 10C + 12C = 22C fish. We know that they caught 13600 fish altogether, so: 22C = 13600 C = 13600 / 22 C = 618.18 (rounded to two decimal places) Now we can find out how many fish Brian catches every time he goes fishing: Brian's catch per trip = 3/5 * C Brian's catch per trip = 3/5 * 618.18 Brian's catch per trip = 370.91 (rounded to two decimal places) So, Brian catches approximately boxed{370.91}  fish every time he goes fishing."},{"instruction":"Find the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2  8x + 15 = 0 where the sum of the roots is a square of an integer. textbf{(A)}  1 textbf{(B)}  2 textbf{(C)}  3 textbf{(D)}  4 textbf{(E)}  5","output":"1. **Identify the coefficients**: For x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0, coefficients are a = 1, b = -8, and c = 15. 2. **Apply Vieta's formulas**:     - r_1 + r_2 = -frac{-8}{1} = 8    - r_1r_2 = frac{15}{1} = 15 3. **Calculate the square of the difference of the roots**: Using the formula (r_1 - r_2)^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2,    - (r_1 - r_2)^2 = 8^2 - 4 times 15    - (r_1 - r_2)^2 = 64 - 60    - (r_1 - r_2)^2 = 4 4. **Find the difference of the roots**:     - r_1 - r_2 = sqrt{4} = 2 5. **Conclusion**: The difference of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0 is 2.

After that, we can divide the total cost by the length of the barbed wire required to find the rate per meter. The area of the square field is given as 3136 sq m. The side length of a square can be found by taking the square root of the area. Side length of the square field = √3136 = 56 meters The perimeter of a square is given by the formula P = 4 * side length. Perimeter of the square field = 4 * 56 = 224 meters Since there are two gates of 1 meter width each, we need to subtract this from the perimeter to find the length of the barbed wire required.

Now, consider the polynomial ( P(x) ).

From the given condition, we have:    [    P(P(n) - 2015) = P(n) cdot Q(n)    ]    for some polynomial ( Q(n) ). 6. Consider the expression ( P(P(n) - 2015) - P(-2015) ). Since ( P(n) ) divides ( P(P(n) - 2015) ), it must also divide ( P(P(n) - 2015) - P(-2015) ). Therefore:    [    P(n) mid P(P(n) - 2015) - P(-2015)    ] 7.

Here's the step-by-step detailed proof: 1. **Setup the Problem**:     - We need to determine whether (n^2) has more divisors ( equiv 1 mod 4) or ( equiv 3 mod 4).    - It is sufficient to consider only odd (n), because considering (n)'s largest odd factor will give the same odd divisors. 2. **Base Case**:     - Consider the smallest odd (n = 1). Then (n^2 = 1):      [      text{Divisors of } 1^2 = {1}      ]      - The divisor 1 is congruent to (1 mod 4). So the base case holds true: There are more divisors ( equiv 1 mod 4) than (3 mod 4). 3. **Inductive Step**:    - Suppose that for an odd (m), (m^2) follows that there are more divisors ( equiv 1 mod 4) than (3 mod 4).    - Let (n) be an odd number and consider the prime factorization of (n).    - Let (p) be a prime factor of (n) and (p^{2a}) be the highest power of (p) dividing (n^2). 4. **Analysis of Divisors**:    - Let ( frac{n^2}{p^{2a}} ) be the remaining part of (n^2) when (p^{2a}) is divided out.    - Let ( h ) and ( k ) be the number of divisors of (frac{n^2}{p^{2a}}) that are (1 mod 4) and (3 mod 4) respectively.    - By induction hypothesis, ( h > k ) for (frac{n^2}{p^{2a}}). 5. **Case 1: ( p equiv 1 mod 4 )**:    - Each power of (p) (including (p^0)) is (1 mod 4).    - Number of divisors of (n^2) that are (1 mod 4): ((2a + 1)h).    - Number of divisors of (n^2) that are (3 mod 4): ((2a + 1)k).    - Thus, ( H = (2a + 1)h) and ( K = (2a + 1)k).

We are required to determine the largest possible value of k. 2. **Constraints imposed by the pieces**:    - Rooks attack along rows and columns.    - Knights attack in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular or vice versa).    Therefore, to prevent any piece from attacking another:    - No two rooks can be in the same row or column.    - Knights must not be placed where they can attack rooks or other knights. 3. **Placement of rooks**:    Suppose we place k rooks.

In each corner a circle is inscribed that also externally touches the two circles inscribed in the adjacent  corners. Show that at least two circles have the same size.","output":"1. **Theorem 1**: A convex quadrilateral (ABCD) has an incircle. Four circles (x, y, z, w) are given such that the circle (x) touches the segments (AD) and (AB), and so on cyclically, and such that the circles (x) and (y) are externally tangent to each other, and so on cyclically. Then, either the quadrilateral (ABCD) is a kite, or the circles (x) and (z) coincide, or the circles (y) and (w) coincide. 2. **Lemma 2**: If two circles with radii (u) and (v) touch each other externally, and one of the two external common tangents of these two circles touches them at the points (P) and (Q), respectively, then (PQ = 2sqrt{uv}). 3. **Lemma 3**: Given a line (g) through a point (A), some positive number (r), and a circle (k) touching the line (g) at a point (L). Then, there exists at most one circle (t) which is externally tangent to the circle (k), has radius (r), lies in the same half-plane with respect to the line (g) as the circle (k) and touches the line (g) at a point lying on the extension of the segment (AL) beyond (L). 4. **Proof of Lemma 3**: Assume that there are two different circles (t_1) and (t_2) which are both externally tangent to the circle (k), have radius (r), lie in the same half-plane with respect to the line (g) as the circle (k) and touch the line (g) at two points both lying on the extension of the segment (AL) beyond (L). Let (T_1) and (T_2) be the centers of these two circles (t_1) and (t_2), and let (M_1) and (M_2) be the points where these two circles touch the line (g). Both of these points (M_1) and (M_2) lie on the extension of the segment (AL) beyond (L). 5. The points (T_1) and (T_2) must be distinct (since, if they were equal, the circles (t_1) and (t_2) would be equal, having the same center (T_1 = T_2) and the same radius (r)). 6. Let (K) be the center and (r_k) the radius of the circle (k). 7. Since the circle (t_1) with center (T_1) and radius (r) is externally tangent to the circle (k) with center (K) and radius (r_k), we have (KT_1 = r_k + r). Similarly, (KT_2 = r_k + r). Thus, (KT_1 = KT_2). 8. Since the circles (t_1), (t_2), (k) have centers (T_1), (T_2), (K) and touch the line (g) at the points (M_1), (M_2), (L), respectively, the lines (T_1M_1), (T_2M_2) and (KL) are all perpendicular to (g), and since (r) is the radius of the circles (t_1) and (t_2) which pass through the points (M_1) and (M_2), respectively, we have (T_1M_1 = r) and (T_2M_2 = r). 9. Since the circle (t_1) with center (T_1) and radius (r) touches the line (g), the distance from the point (T_1) to the line (g) equals (r). Similarly, the distance from the point (T_2) to the line (g) equals (r). Thus, the points (T_1) and (T_2) are equidistant from the line (g). Also, the points (T_1) and (T_2) lie in the same half-plane with respect to the line (g) (in fact, the circles (t_1) and (t_2) must lie in the same half-plane with respect to the line (g) as the circle (k); hence, the centers (T_1) and (T_2) of these two circles must also lie in this half-plane). Thus, (T_1T_2 parallel g). Hence, the perpendicular bisector of the segment (T_1T_2) must be perpendicular to the line (g). On the other hand, this perpendicular bisector of the segment (T_1T_2) passes through the point (K) (since (KT_1 = KT_2)). Hence, this perpendicular bisector is the perpendicular to the line (g) through the point (K). Since (KL perp g), this perpendicular also passes through the point (L). Thus, we have shown that the perpendicular bisector of the segment (T_1T_2) passes through the point (L), and this entails (LT_1 = LT_2). Together with (T_1M_1 = T_2M_2) (because (T_1M_1 = r) and (T_2M_2 = r)), this yields the congruence of the right-angled triangles (LT_1M_1) and (LT_2M_2); thus, (LM_1 = LM_2). Consequently, either the points (M_1) and (M_2) coincide, or the point (L) is the midpoint of the segment (M_1M_2). But the points (M_1) and (M_2) cannot coincide because this would yield (T_1T_2 perp g) (since both points (T_1) and (T_2) would lie on the perpendicular to the line (g) at the point (M_1 = M_2)), contradicting (T_1T_2 parallel g); and the point (L) cannot be the midpoint of the segment (M_1M_2), since both points (M_1) and (M_2) lie on the extension of the segment (AL) beyond (L). Hence, we get a contradiction, and our assumption that there exist two different circles (t_1) and (t_2) both satisfying the condition of Lemma 3 was wrong. Thus, we have shown that there exists at most one such circle, and Lemma 3 is proven. 10. Let's solve the problem now. Let the circle (x) have center (X) and radius (r_x) and touch the sides (AD) and (AB) at the points (X_d) and (X_b), respectively. Similarly define the objects (Y), (r_y), (Y_a), (Y_c) for the circle (y), the objects (Z), (r_z), (Z_b), (Z_d) for the circle (z), and the objects (W), (r_w), (W_c), (W_a) for the circle (w). 11. Since the points (X_b) and (Y_a) both lie on the segment (AB), two cases are possible: Either the points (A), (X_b), (Y_a), (B) lie on the line (AB) in this order, or the points (A), (Y_b), (X_b), (B) lie on the line (AB) in this order. But the second of these two cases, the case when the points (A), (Y_b), (X_b), (B) lie on the line (AB) in this order, is actually impossible: if it was the case, the segments (X_bX_d) and (Y_aY_c) would intersect at a common interior point; this point would then be an interior point of both circles (x) and (y), but these two circles (x) and (y) are externally tangent to each other and therefore cannot have common interior points. Hence, the points (A), (X_b), (Y_a), (B) lie on the line (AB) in this order. Similarly, the points (B), (Y_c), (Z_b), (C) lie on the line (BC) in this order; the points (C), (Z_d), (W_c), (D) lie on the line (CD) in this order; the points (D), (W_a), (X_d), (A) lie on the line (DA) in this order. 12. Since the quadrilateral (ABCD) has an incircle, (AB + CD = BC + DA). In other words,  [ (AX_b + X_bY_a + Y_aB) + (CZ_d + Z_dW_c + W_cD) = (BY_c + Y_cZ_b + Z_bC) + (DW_a + W_aX_d + X_dA). ] But since the two tangent segments from a point to a circle are equal, we have (AX_b = X_dA), (BY_c = Y_aB), (CZ_d = Z_bC), (DW_a = W_cD), so this equation simplifies to  [ X_bY_a + Z_dW_c = Y_cZ_b + W_aX_d. ] Now, since the circles (x) and (y) with radii (r_x) and (r_y) touch each other externally, and the line (AB), which is one of their external common tangents, touches them at the points (X_b) and (Y_a), by Lemma 2 we have  [ X_bY_a = 2sqrt{r_x r_y}. ] Similarly,  [ Y_cZ_b = 2sqrt{r_y r_z}, quad Z_dW_c = 2sqrt{r_z r_w}, quad text{and} quad W_aX_d = 2sqrt{r_w r_x}. ] Hence, the equation (X_bY_a + Z_dW_c = Y_cZ_b + W_aX_d) becomes [ 2sqrt{r_x r_y} + 2sqrt{r_z r_w} = 2sqrt{r_y r_z} + 2sqrt{r_w r_x} ] [ Longleftrightarrow sqrt{r_x r_y} + sqrt{r_z r_w} = sqrt{r_y r_z} + sqrt{r_w r_x} ] [ Longleftrightarrow sqrt{r_x r_y} + sqrt{r_z r_w} - sqrt{r_y r_z} - sqrt{r_w r_x} = 0 ] [ Longleftrightarrow (sqrt{r_x} - sqrt{r_z})(sqrt{r_y} - sqrt{r_w}) = 0 ] [ Longleftrightarrow sqrt{r_x} - sqrt{r_z} = 0 text{ or } sqrt{r_y} - sqrt{r_w} = 0 ] [ Longleftrightarrow r_x = r_z text{ or } r_y = r_w. ] 13. We can WLOG assume that (r_x = r_z). Denote (R = r_x = r_z). 14. Now, consider the line (AB) through the point (B), the positive number (R), and the circle (y) touching the line (AB) at the point (Y_a). The circle (x) is externally tangent to the circle (y), has radius (r_x = R), lies in the same half-plane with respect to the line (AB) as the circle (y) (in fact, both circles (x) and (y) lie in the half-plane with respect to the line (AB) which contains the quadrilateral (ABCD), because the circle (x) touches the segment (AD) and the circle (y) touches the segment (BC)) and touches the line (AB) at the point (X_b) lying on the extension of the segment (BY_a) beyond (Y_a). Thus, the circle (x) is the (B, AB, R, y)-circle. Similarly, the circle (z) is the (B, BC, R, y)-circle. 15. Now, the reflection with respect to the angle bisector of the angle (ABC) maps the line (AB) to the line (BC), the point (B) to itself, and the circle (y) to itself (since the center of the circle (y) lies on the angle bisector of the angle (ABC), because the circle (y) touches the sides (BA) and (BC) of this angle). Hence, this reflection maps the (B, AB, R, y)-circle to the (B, BC, R, y)-circle. In other words, it maps the circle (x) to the circle (z). Hence, this reflection maps the center (X) of the circle (x) to the center (Z) of the circle (z). 16. Now, if (X = Z), then the circles (x) and (z) coincide (because they have the same center (X = Z) and the same radius (r_x = r_z)) and Theorem 1 is proven. So it remains only to consider the case when (X neq Z). In this case, the fact that the reflection with respect to the angle bisector of the angle (ABC) maps the point (X) to the point (Z) can be rewritten as follows: The angle bisector of the angle (ABC) is the perpendicular bisector of the segment (XZ). Similarly, the angle bisector of the angle (ADC) is the perpendicular bisector of the segment (XZ). Hence, the angle bisectors of the angles (ABC) and (ADC) are one and the same line; this line must be the line (BD). Hence, (measuredangle ABD = measuredangle CBD) and (measuredangle ADB = measuredangle CDB). Together with (BD = BD), this yields that the triangles (ABD) and (CBD) are congruent, so the quadrilateral (ABCD) is a kite. Theorem 1 is thus proven.

Therefore, the profit from selling each unit of type A is 100 yuan, and the profit from selling each unit of type B is 150 yuan. boxed{text{The profit from selling each unit of type A is 100 yuan, and from type B is 150 yuan.}}  Part 2: Functional Relationship of y with Respect to x Given that x is the number of type A computers purchased and the total number of computers is 100, the number of type B computers purchased is 100 - x. The total profit y from selling these computers is: [y = 100x + 150(100 - x)] Simplifying this expression: [y = 100x + 15000 - 150x] [y = -50x + 15000] Thus, the functional relationship of y with respect to x is: boxed{y = -50x + 15000}  Part 3: Profit from Purchasing 100 Computers with At Least 20 Units of Type A Given that y = -50x + 15000 and x geqslant 20, the profit y decreases as x increases. To maximize profit, we choose the minimum value for x, which is 20. Therefore, the number of type B computers is 100 - 20 = 80. Calculating the profit: [y = 20 times 100 + 80 times 150] [y = 2000 + 12000] [y = 14000] Thus, when purchasing 20 units of type A computers and 80 units of type B computers, the profit from purchasing 100 computers of both types is 14000 yuan. boxed{text{The profit is 14000 yuan.}}"},{"instruction":"an acuteangled triangle (ABC), heights (BD) and (CE) are drawn.

From vertices (B) and (C) perpendiculars (BF) and (CG) are dropped onto the line (ED). We need to prove that (EF = DG). 1. **Identifying the circumcircle:**    Since (BD) and (CE) are altitudes, we know that:    - (angle BDA = angle BEC = 90^circ)    Therefore, points (B, C, D), and (E) lie on the circumcircle of triangle (ABC) because (angle BDC) and (angle BEC) are right angles (thcircle of right angles). Here, (O) is the center of the circumcircle and also the midpoint of (BC). Thus, all these points lie on a circle with diameter (BC). 2. **Dropping the Perpendicular:**        Let (H) be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from point (O) (midpoint of (BC)) to the line (ED). Since (O) is the center of the circumcircle, the arc (DE) subtends a right angle at the circumference (arc fact). 3. **Symmetry and Midpoint Arguments:**        - Because (O) is the midpoint of (BC), the perpendicular from (O) to (ED) also bisects that segment:      [      DH = HE      ]    - Similarly, (OH) is a line of symmetry for the trapezoid (BFHG) because the line (OH) is the height of the isosceles trapezoid.

Let's consider the numerator, which is composed of two terms, -cos(2x) and sin(2x). Their maximum and minimum values are -1 and 1, respectively. We need to explore the combination of these terms to maximize the numerator. We can utilize the fact that the maximum value of acostheta + bsintheta is sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, where a and b are constants.

The given relation is: S_n = a_n^2 - 1. To determine the type of sequence {a_n}, let's consider the sum of the first n+1 terms, S_{n+1}, which will include the next term a_{n+1}. The sum S_{n+1} can be expressed as: S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1}. Substituting the given S_n equation into this, we get: S_{n+1} = (a_n^2 - 1) + a_{n+1}. Since S_{n+1} also corresponds to a_{n+1}^2 - 1, we can set up the following equation: a_{n+1}^2 - 1 = a_n^2 - 1 + a_{n+1}. Simplifying this: a_{n+1}^2 - a_{n+1} = a_n^2. This indicates that the difference of the square of the term a_{n+1} and the term a_{n+1} itself gives the square of the previous term a_n. However, this relationship does not necessarily conform to either an arithmetic or geometric sequence. To find out, we must first define those sequences: - An arithmetic sequence has a common difference (d) between consecutive terms, i.e., a_{n+1} - a_n = d. - A geometric sequence has a common ratio (r) between consecutive terms, i.e., a_{n+1} / a_n = r. Now we need to check if the original relationship can represent either of these definitions. Let's rearrange the relation between the terms: a_{n+1}^2 - a_{n}^2 = a_{n+1}. This can be factored using the difference of squares: (a_{n+1} + a_n)(a_{n+1} - a_n) = a_{n+1}. For this equation to be true for all terms in the sequence, consider the following cases: - If a_{n+1} - a_n = 0, then a_{n+1} = a_n, which hints at a constant sequence (a special type of arithmetic sequence with d=0). - If a_{n+1} + a_n neq 1, then for the product of these two factors to equal a_{n+1}, we must have (a_{n+1} - a_n) = 1, which implies an arithmetic sequence with common difference d=1. - Alternatively, if a_{n+1} - a_n = 1 and a_{n+1} + a_n = a_{n+1}, this reduces to a_n = 0 for all n, which is not possible since a is a non-zero real number.

If (0 < alpha < frac{1}{2}), then:    [    2^{n+1} sqrt{2} = 2 leftlfloor 2^n sqrt{2} rightrfloor + 2 alpha    ]    Therefore,    [    leftlfloor 2^{n+1} sqrt{2} rightrfloor = 2 leftlfloor 2^n sqrt{2} rightrfloor    ]    This is even, hence a composite number. 6. If (frac{1}{2} leq alpha < 1), then:    [    begin{aligned}    2^{n+1} sqrt{2} &= 2 leftlfloor 2^n sqrt{2} rightrfloor + 2 alpha     leftlfloor 2^{n+1} sqrt{2} rightrfloor &= 2 leftlfloor 2^n sqrt{2} rightrfloor + (2 alpha - 1)     & = 2 leftlfloor 2^n sqrt{2} rightrfloor + 1 quad text{ (since } 2 alpha - 1 < 1)    end{aligned}    ]    This is an odd number. 7. Note that ( 2 alpha - lfloor 2 alpha rfloor < alpha ), thus after multiplying by 2 several times, (alpha) will eventually fall between 0 and (frac{1}{2}). 8. From this point, each multiplication by 2 results in an even number, proving that the sequence contains infinitely many even numbers. Conclusion: There are infinitely many even numbers in the sequence (left{ a_k right}). Since even numbers are composite numbers (except for the number 2, which is prime but rarely appears in this form in the context of the sequence), there are infinitely many composite numbers in the sequence.

What could the weights of the other three bars be, given that no matter which two bars the first pirate chooses, the second pirate can divide the remaining bars so that both pirates end up with an equal amount of gold?","output":"1. Let us list the masses of the ingots in ascending order as ( a leq b leq c leq d leq e ). 2. Assume the first pirate chooses the ingots with masses ( d ) and ( e ). The condition ensures that the remaining ingots ( a, b, ) and ( c ) can be divided equally by the second pirate. This implies ( d + e = a + b + c ). 3. Similarly, if the first pirate chooses the ingots ( c ) and ( e ), the remaining masses ( a, b, ) and ( d ) must sum up equally. Hence, ( d + e = a + b + c ) and ( c + e = a + b + d ). 4. Solving these two equations, we get inequalities and equalities by removing common terms:    [ d + e = a + b + c ]    [ c + e = a + b + d ] 5. Subtracting the second equation from the first:    [ (d + e) - (c + e) = (a + b + c) - (a + b + d) ]    [ d - c = c - d ]    Hence, we conclude that:    [ c = d ]    This implies:    [ e = a + b ] 6. Therefore, the ingots must have masses ( a, b, c=c, e=a+b ). 7. Consider when the first pirate picks ( a ) and ( e ). Adding another ingot ( c ) (since ( c ) is the same as ( d )), results in unbalanced gold distribution compared to the remaining ingots. Hence, the masses must satisfy other conditions ensuring equal distribution. 8.

We are given that Ronaldo is currently 36 years old, so Rd = 36. We are looking for the ratio of their ages one year ago.

So, in 4 years, Roonie's age will be R + 4 and Ronaldo's age will be Rd + 4 = 36 + 4 = 40. The future ratio of their ages is given as: (R + 4) / (Rd + 4) = 7 / 8 Substituting Rd with 36, we get: (R + 4) / (40) = 7 / 8 Cross-multiplying, we get: 8(R + 4) = 7 * 40 Expanding, we get: 8R + 32 = 280 Subtracting 32 from both sides, we get: 8R = 280 - 32 8R = 248 Dividing both sides by 8, we get: R = 248 / 8 R = 31 So, Roonie's current age is 31 years old. Now, we can find the ratio of their ages one year ago: Roonie's age one year ago = R - 1 = 31 - 1 = 30 Ronaldo's age one year ago = Rd - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35 The ratio of their ages one year ago is: Roonie's age one year ago : Ronaldo's age one year ago = 30 : 35 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 5: 30 / 5 : 35 / 5 = 6 : 7 Therefore, the ratio of Roonie's and Ronaldo's age one year ago was boxed{6:7} ."},{"instruction":"A florist received between 300 and 400 roses for decorating a celebration.

Given that lfloor a^k rfloor + lfloor b^k rfloor = lfloor a rfloor^k + lfloor b rfloor^k for infinitely many k, it implies that a and b must either be in (0,1) or be natural numbers. This is because, in Case 3, the equality lfloor a^k rfloor = lfloor a rfloor^k can only hold for a finite number of k. Therefore, a in (0,1) cup mathbb{N} and b in (0,1) cup mathbb{N}.

This leads us to the first step of our solution: 1. Since a neq 0, we can safely say that frac{b}{a} = 0 because 0 must correspond to one of the elements in the set, and frac{b}{a} is the only term that can be manipulated to equal 0 by adjusting b. This gives us: [ frac{b}{a} = 0 implies b = 0 ] 2. Substituting b = 0 into the set, we get: [ {a, 0, 1} = {a^{2}, a + 0, 0} ] Simplifying, we have: [ {a, 0, 1} = {a^{2}, a, 0} ] 3. From the simplified sets, we can deduce that a^{2} = 1. This is because the only way for the sets to be equal is if the elements can be matched one-to-one, and since a and 0 are already accounted for, a^{2} must match with 1. This leads us to: [ a^{2} = 1 implies a = pm 1 ] 4.

Show that for any two finite collections of intersecting triangles, there exists a line that intersects all the triangles. *Proposed by usjl*","output":"1. **Define the Problem and Initial Setup:**    We are given two finite collections of intersecting triangles, ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ). We need to show that there exists a line that intersects all the triangles in both collections. 2. **Intervals of Directed Angles:**    For any point ( P ) and a triangle ( T ), the directed angles of lines through ( P ) that also pass through ( T ) constitute an interval ( I_{P, T} ). This is because the lines passing through ( P ) and intersecting the edges of ( T ) form a continuous range of angles. 3. **Claim 1: Non-Empty Intersection of Intervals:**    For any point ( P ) and a finite intersecting set ( S ), the interval ( cap_{T in S} I_{P, T} ) is non-empty.    - **Base Case:** For ( |S| = 1 ), the interval is simply ( I_{P, T} ) for the single triangle ( T ), which is non-empty.    - **Inductive Step:** Assume the claim holds for ( |S| = k ). For ( |S| = k+1 ), let ( S = S' cup {T} ) where ( |S'| = k ). Suppose for contradiction that ( I_{P, S'} cap I_{P, T} = emptyset ). Let ( I_{P, S'} = [l, r] ) and ( I_{P, T} = [l', r'] ). If ( r' < l ) or ( r < l' ), this implies that some triangle in ( S' ) does not intersect ( T ), contradicting the assumption that all triangles in ( S ) intersect. Hence, ( I_{P, S} ) is non-empty. 4. **Enclosing Circle and Parameterization:**    Consider a circle enclosing all the triangles in ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ). Parameterize the points on the circle with ( theta ) from ( 0 ) to ( 2pi ). For each point ( P ) on the circle, define ( I_P = cap_{T in S_1} I_{P, T} ) and ( J_P = cap_{T in S_2} I_{P, T} ). 5. **Claim 2: Continuity of Intervals:**    As ( theta ) varies, the endpoints of ( I_P ) and ( J_P ) vary continuously.    - The directed angle of a line from ( P ) to a fixed point on the circle is a continuous function of ( theta ).    - For a line segment, the interval of valid angles is determined by the angles to its endpoints, which vary continuously with ( theta ).    - The intervals for triangles are intersections of intervals for their edges, and the endpoints of these intervals are continuous functions of ( theta ). 6. **Claim 3: Intersection of Intervals:**    As ( theta ) varies from ( 0 ) to ( 2pi ), there exists a ( theta ) where ( I_P ) and ( J_P ) intersect.    - Suppose ( I_P ) and ( J_P ) do not intersect for ( theta = 0 ) and ( theta = 2pi ). Draw a line through ( P ) at an angle ( theta_0 ) that separates ( I_P ) and ( J_P ). Let this line intersect the circle again at ( P' ).    - For ( theta ) corresponding to ( P' ), the intervals ( I_{P'} ) and ( J_{P'} ) must maintain the separation. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, if ( I_P ) and ( J_P ) are disjoint at ( theta = 0 ) and ( theta = 2pi ), they must intersect at some intermediate ( theta ). 7. **Conclusion:**    Since ( I_P ) and ( J_P ) must intersect at some ( theta ), there exists a line through ( P ) that intersects all triangles in both ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ).

Find the least possible number of *central* vertices in  G .","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We are given a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices and two integers ( n ) and ( k ) such that (frac{3}{2} leq frac{1}{2} n < k < n). The graph ( G ) satisfies two conditions:    - ( G ) does not contain a ((k+1))-clique.    - Adding any edge to ( G ) creates a ((k+1))-clique.        We need to find the least possible number of central vertices in ( G ). 2. **Initial Claim:**    The solution claims that the answer is ( boxed{2k - n} ). This can be derived by considering the Turan graph ( T_{n, k} ). 3. **Turan's Theorem:**    Turan's Theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a graph on ( n ) vertices that does not contain a ((k+1))-clique is given by the Turan graph ( T_{n, k} ), which is a ( k )-partite graph with parts as equal as possible. 4. **Minimal Number of Central Vertices:**    Consider the graph with the minimal number of central vertices. We claim that there do not exist three vertices ( u, v, w ) in the graph such that ( v ) is adjacent to ( w ) and ( u ) is not adjacent to ( v ) and not adjacent to ( w ). Assume for the sake of contradiction that such vertices exist. 5. **Central Vertex ( a ):**    Consider a central vertex ( a ). We claim that any ((k+1))-clique that exists after an edge is added between vertices ( u ) and ( v ) contains ( a ). Assume the contrary, then there is a ( k-1 )-clique all of whose vertices are connected to ( u ) and ( v ) and none of whose vertices are ( a ). But then the vertices of that ( k-1 )-clique and ( a ) and ( u ) form a ((k+1))-clique, which is a contradiction. 6. **Modifying the Graph:**    Now, delete the edge between ( a ) and ( v ) and add an edge between ( v ) and ( u ). We claim that this new graph satisfies all the properties outlined in the problem and has fewer central vertices than the graph we started with. Since ( a ) is no longer a central vertex and since clearly no vertex became a new central vertex in the new graph, it suffices to check that the new graph contains no ((k+1))-clique and adding any edge to the new graph results in a graph with a ((k+1))-clique. 7. **Verification:**    Since all ((k+1))-cliques formed by adding an edge between ( u ) and ( v ) contained ( a ) and we deleted the edge between ( a ) and ( v ), we know that the new graph contains no ((k+1))-clique. Also, if we add an edge between ( a ) and ( v ) in the new graph, we obtain the same graph as if we had added an edge between ( u ) and ( v ) in the original graph, which by definition yields a graph containing a ((k+1))-clique. Therefore, the new graph contradicts the minimality of our original graph. 8. **Conclusion:**    This means that \\"not being adjacent\\" is an equivalence relation between vertices, which means that our graph is complete and partite. Since it must be at least ( k )-partite, we easily obtain the desired result."},{"instruction":"A pasta dish at Luigi's weighs 200 grams, of which 50 grams are sauce.

Divide the count by 2: [ frac{15 times 81}{2} = 607.5 ] This calculation has produced a non-integer result which indicates a logical inconsistency, likely due to misunderstanding the constraints about the elements. Let's reassess the problem setup. **Revised Step 2:** Each of the remaining 4 elements must be in at least one of the subsets since the union of both subsets is T.

This means that the numerator and the denominator must have the same sign. Since b is positive, b + 3 is always positive. Therefore, for the right hand side to be positive, b - 1 must also be positive, which tells us that b > 1. Let's rewrite the equation as a quadratic equation in a: [a^2 - a(b + 1) + (b + 3) = 0 ] For a to be real and positive, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative: [(b + 1)^2 - 4(b + 3) geq 0 ] [b^2 + 2b + 1 - 4b - 12 geq 0 ] [b^2 - 2b - 11 geq 0 ] This is a quadratic inequality.

So the range for b is b geq 1 + 2sqrt{3}. Now let's calculate the minimum value for ab given that b geq 1 + 2sqrt{3}. Since b - 1 is positive, by rearranging ab = a + b + 3, we have: [ab - b = a + 3 ] [a(b - 1) = 3 ] If we consider b = 1 + 2sqrt{3}, the minimum value of b - 1 will be 2sqrt{3}, so: [a cdot 2sqrt{3} = 3 ] [a = frac{3}{2sqrt{3}} ] [a = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] So, the minimum value of ab when b = 1 + 2sqrt{3} and a = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} can be calculated as: [ab = left(1 + 2sqrt{3}right) cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] [ab = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 3 ] [ab = frac{1}{2}sqrt{3} + 3 ] We note that this is the product when b is at the smallest value it can take. For larger values of b, the product ab will be larger. Thus, the range of values for ab starts from this value and stretches to infinity.

We know that the total protein in the mixture is 36.4 lb, and we have already accounted for 33.6 lb from the soybean meal, so the protein from the other meal is: 36.4 lb - 33.6 lb = 2.8 lb of protein Now we can find the percentage of protein in the other meal by dividing the amount of protein by the total weight of the other meal and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage: P% = (2.8 lb / 40 lb) * 100 P% = 0.07 * 100 P% = 7% Therefore, the percentage of protein in the other meal is boxed{7%} ."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=2ln x+x^{2}mx (min R).

Since 2(frac {1}{x}+x)geq4 sqrt {xcdot frac {1}{x}}=4, with equality holding if and only if x=1, We obtain mleq4. Hence, the range of the real number m is (-infty,4]. (2) From (1), we have f'(x)=frac {2}{x}+2x-m=frac {2x^{2}-mx+2}{x}. Let 2x^{2}-mx+2=0. Since 5 < m < frac {17}{2}, f(x) has two extreme points.

Let's label the numbers around the circle for convenience, starting with 1 and proceeding clockwise. We denote these numbers as a_1=1, a_2, ldots, a_{12}. 2. Notice that for any 1 leq i leq 6, the following inequalities hold:    [    a_{i+1} - a_{1} = (a_{i+1} - a_{i}) + (a_{i} - a_{i-1}) + cdots + (a_{2} - a_{1}) leq 10i    ]    This is because each pairwise difference a_{j+1} - a_{j} (for 1 leq j leq i) can be at most 10. 3. Similarly, for any 1 leq i leq 6, we also have:    [    a_{13-i} - a_1 = (a_{13-i} - a_{12-i}) + cdots + (a_{12} - a_1) leq 10i    ]    Thus, the maximum value of a_7 (which is halfway around the circle from a_1) can be calculated by:    [    a_{7} leq a_{1} + 6 cdot 10 = 1 + 60 = 61    ] 4. If a_7 = 61, then each difference a_{i+1} - a_i = 10. This includes a_{2} - a_{1}, a_{3} - a_{2}, ldots, a_{7} - a_{6} and a_7 - a_8, a_8 - a_9, ldots, a_{12} - a_1. If all these differences are 10, we would have:    [    a_2 = a_{12} = a_1 + 10 = 11    ]    This leads to a contradiction since the sequence cannot cycle back to the starting value correctly if all changes are 10. 5. Therefore, a_{7} < 61. The logical next highest upper bound by allowing for some differences of 7 instead is:    [    a_{7} leq 1 + 5 cdot 10 + 7 = 1 + 50 + 7 = 58    ]    Hence, the maximum possible value of a_{7} is 58. 6.

Since K is the midpoint of AL, and EF is the midline, A to K is half the length of AL, hence K bisects SR, so AS = AR. 4. **Symmetry property**: Applying the same reasoning, since BM and CN intersect their respective midlines (and the respective intersections are the midpoints), we have:     BT = BU quad text{and} quad CP = CQ  5. **Using length relationships**:    - Set the radius of the circle centered at H as r.

To show that there cannot be more than four pairwise distinct numbers among them, we assume the contrary for contradiction purposes. Let's arrange the numbers in non-increasing order such that (a_1 geq a_2 geq ldots geq a_{4n}). 3. Select any four distinct numbers, say (a, b, c, d) from the set, arranged such that (a > b > c > d). These numbers form a geometric progression, which means there exists a common ratio (r) such that:    [    frac{b}{a} = frac{c}{b} = frac{d}{c} = r    ]    Hence, we can write the relationships:    [    b = ar, quad c = ar^2, quad d = ar^3    ] 4.

Since ( x_{n+1} > x_n ) and the difference is an integer, it follows that ( x_{n+1} = x_n + 1 ). 7. **Generalize for any integer ( n ):**    - Similarly, for any integer ( n ) in ( (N, infty) ), there exists an integer ( x_{n+k} ) such that ( P(x_{n+k}) = n+k ) and ( x_{n+k} = x_n + k ). 8. **Formulate the polynomial:**    - This implies ( P(x_n + k) = n + k ) for all non-negative integers ( k ). Therefore, ( P(x) = x + C ) for some constant ( C ). 9. **Verify the polynomial:**    - Since ( P(x) = x + C ) satisfies the condition that if ( P(a) ) is an integer, then ( a ) must be an integer, it is a valid solution. 10. **Conclusion:**     - The only polynomials ( P(x) ) with real coefficients that satisfy the given condition are of the form ( P(x) = x + C ) where ( C ) is an integer. The final answer is ( boxed{ P(x) = x + C } ) where ( C in mathbb{Z} )."},{"instruction":"y, Ron and Neville are having a race on their broomsticks.

The discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation is given by Delta = b^{2}-4ac. For the equation x^{2}-8x+m=0, we have a=1, b=-8, and c=m. Therefore, the discriminant is: [ Delta = (-8)^{2}-4(1)(m) = 64-4m ] For the roots to be equal, Delta must be 0. Thus, we have: [ 64-4m = 0 Rightarrow 64 = 4m Rightarrow m = 16 ] Substituting m=16 back into the original equation gives x^{2}-8x+16=0, which simplifies to (x-4)^{2}=0, yielding x_{1}=x_{2}=4. Since 4+4 > 6, this satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, making m=16 a valid solution. **Case 2: The legs of the isosceles triangle are 6.** In this scenario, one of the roots of the quadratic equation is x=6.

Since 6+6 > 2, this also satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, making m=12 another valid solution. **Conclusion:** The value of m can be either 12 or 16 based on the different configurations of the isosceles triangle.

Additionally, he spent 10% of the total amount he had as cash. So, the total amount spent is the sum of the amounts spent on raw materials, machinery, and the 10% of the total cash: Total spent = 500 (raw materials) + 400 (machinery) + 10% of T (cash) We can express 10% of T as 0.10T. So, the equation becomes: Total spent = 500 + 400 + 0.10T We know that the total spent is actually coming from the total amount of cash Kanul had, which is T. Therefore, we can set up the equation: T = 500 + 400 + 0.10T Now, let's solve for T: T - 0.10T = 500 + 400 0.90T = 900 T = 900 / 0.90 T = 1000 So, the total amount of cash Kanul had was boxed{1000} ."},{"instruction":"Points ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) are located on the sides ( AC ) and ( AB ), respectively, of triangle ( ABC ).

The segments BB_1 and CC_1 intersect at point P. Let O be the center of the incircle of triangle AB_1C_1 and M be the point where this incircle touches segment B_1C_1. It is given that lines OP and BB_1 are perpendicular. 2. **Identify Angles Involved:**    We denote the angle angle AB_1C_1 = beta. To find the required angles:    - angle AOC_1 can be identified using properties of triangle AB_1C_1.    - angle MPB_1 involves the geometry of the points P and M and their angles with O and B_1. 3. **Calculating angle AOC_1:**        Since O is the incenter of triangle AB_1C_1, the angle angle AOC_1 can be determined using the incenter properties:    [    angle AOC_1 = 90^circ + frac{beta}{2}    ] 4. **Determining angle MB_1O:**        Because M is the touchpoint of the incircle with B_1C_1, the angle angle MB_1O made by radius OM and side B_1C_1 in triangle AB_1C_1 is:    [    angle MB_1O = frac{beta}{2}    ] 5. **Using the Perpendicularity:**        Since OP is perpendicular to BB_1 and point P lies on BB_1, there is a right-angle property at point P:    [    angle OPB_1 = 90^circ    ] 6. **Angles from P and M:**        Considering points P and M related to circle geometry, the inscribed angles subtended by diameter OB_1. The angles angle MPO and angle MB_1O subtended from similar arcs:    [    angle MPO = angle MB_1O = frac{beta}{2}    ] 7. **Final Angle Calculation:**    The angle angle MPB_1 is the sum of angles B_1:    [    angle MPB_1 = angle OPB_1 + angle MPO    ]    Combining all angles:    [    angle MPB_1 = 90^circ + frac{beta}{2}    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    Since both angles are formed with the same components 90^circ + frac{beta}{2}:    [    angle AOC_1 = angle MPB_1 = 90^circ + frac{beta}{2}    ] Hence, we have proved: [ boxed{angle AOC_1 = angle MPB_1} ]"},{"instruction":"Let mathfrak{J}_{i}, i in I be arbitrary sets.

To simplify the proof, we will translate the set notation into indicator functions. Let I_{i j} = I_{i j}(omega) be the indicator function of the set A_{i j}. The union and intersection relations in terms of indicator functions can be stated as:        max_{i in mathfrak{I}} min_{j in mathfrak{J}_{i}} I_{i j}(omega) = min_{j_{infty}} max_{i in mathfrak{I}} I_{i j_{i}}(omega), quad omega in Omega.     3. We need to demonstrate this relation. For a fixed omega in Omega, consider:        max_{i in mathfrak{I}} min_{j in mathfrak{J}_{i}} I_{i j} = 1.        This is true if and only if:        exists i in mathfrak{I} , forall j in mathfrak{J}_{i}: I_{i j}(omega) = 1.     4. Interpreting this condition, it means there is at least one index i in mathfrak{I} for which all A_{i j} (where j in mathfrak{J}_{i}) contains the element omega. So, omega is in:        bigcup_{i in mathfrak{I}} bigcap_{j in mathfrak{J}_{i}} A_{i j}.     5. This condition also translates to:        min_{j_{infty}} max_{i in mathfrak{I}} I_{i j_{i}}(omega) = 1.        This condition is met if:        forall j_{infty}, exists i in mathfrak{I}: I_{i j_{i}}(omega) = 1.        The interpretation of this is that for any choice of j_{infty}, there exists an i such that omega in A_{i j_i}. Thus, omega is in:        bigcap_{j_{infty}} bigcup_{i in mathfrak{I}} A_{i j_{i}}.     6. Having shown the equivalence in indicator function terms for a fixed omega, we conclude:          bigcup_{i in mathfrak{I}} bigcap_{j in mathfrak{J}_{i}} A_{i j} = bigcap_{j_{infty}} bigcup_{i in mathfrak{I}} A_{i j_{i}}.      7.

Therefore, the second relation is also valid.

Since ( d_k = n ), this implies ( d_{k-2} mid d_{k-1} + n ). 3. Since ( d_{k-2} mid d_{k-1} + n ) and ( d_{k-2} mid n ), it follows that ( d_{k-2} mid d_{k-1} ).

Therefore, their sum is also non-negative: [ (a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2 geq 0 ] This is a contradiction because we assumed that the sum is less than zero.

First, we want to show that (k < 10).     - If (k geq 10), then in our sequence the term (P(10n)) would appear.         - Since (10n) ends in 0, the product of its digits, (P(10n)), would be 0.         - Therefore, we would obtain (P(n) < 0), which is impossible since (P(n)), being the product of digits, must be non-negative.  4.

This means these points lie on the same circle with diameter BD. 2. **Diameter Condition**: Since M and N lie on the circle, we know from the properties of the circle that the segment BD subtends a right angle to any point on the circle.

Define ( K_j = { r_i mid i in I_j } ) for ( j = 1, 2, 3 ). 5. **Singleton and Toilet Region Definitions:**    - A singleton is a grid where all its neighbors have a different color.    - A toilet region is an interval with only black grids and singleton white grids. If it ranges from the ( a )-th to the ( b )-th grid, then ( a = 1 ) or the ( (a-1) )-th grid must be a non-singleton white grid, and ( b = n ) or the ( (b+1) )-th grid must be a non-singleton white grid. 6. **Assigning Grids to Sets:**    Let ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m ) be all the grids that aren't in any toilet region in that order. Define:    [    { a_i mid i equiv 1, 2 pmod{3} } subset K_1, quad { a_i mid i equiv 2, 3 pmod{3} } subset K_2, quad { a_i mid i equiv 3, 1 pmod{3} } subset K_3.    ]    For singleton white grids, assign them to ( K_1, K_2, K_3 ). For singleton black grids, ensure they do not overlap with ( K_1, K_2, K_3 ). 7. **Handling Toilet Regions:**    For non-singleton grids in toilet regions, consider three cases based on the length of the region:    - Length ( 3m ): Assign grids cyclically to ( K_{l mod 3}, K_{(l+1) mod 3}, K_{(l+2) mod 3} ).    - Length ( 3m+1 ): Adjust the cyclic assignment accordingly.    - Length ( 3m+2 ): Adjust the cyclic assignment accordingly. 8. **Combining Conditions:**    Combine all conditions to form ( K_1, K_2, K_3 ) and thus ( I_1, I_2, I_3 ). Verify that this satisfies the conditions in part 1 and the hypothesis. Similarly, construct ( I_4, I_5, I_6 ). 9. **Conclusion:**    The construction ensures that:    [    sum_{j=1}^6 left| sum_{i in I_j} r_i right| geq sum_{i=1}^n |r_i|.    ]    Hence, there exists a subset ( I ) such that:    [    left| sum_{i in I} r_i right| geq frac{1}{6} sum_{i=1}^n |r_i|.    ]    (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"w many fourdigit numbers N = underline{a},underline{b},underline{c},underline{d} satisfy all of the following conditions? 1. 3000 le N < 8000. 2.

Given that ( overline{abc} ) is a factor of ( overline{abcd} ),     [     overline{abcd} = 10 times overline{abc} + d.     ]          Thus, (d) must be zero for ( overline{abc} ) to divide ( overline{abcd} ) without any remainder.

From the problem, we know that 15% of the oranges are rotten, which means that 85% of the oranges are in good condition. Since there are 600 oranges, the number of oranges in good condition is 85% of 600: Good oranges = 0.85 * 600 Similarly, 6% of the bananas are rotten, so 94% of the bananas are in good condition: Good bananas = 0.94 * B The total percentage of fruits in good condition is 88.6%. This percentage is out of the total number of fruits (oranges + bananas), so we can write the following equation: Total good fruits / Total fruits = 88.6% Substituting the expressions for good oranges and good bananas, we get: (0.85 * 600 + 0.94 * B) / (600 + B) = 0.886 Now we can solve for B: (510 + 0.94B) / (600 + B) = 0.886 Multiplying both sides by (600 + B) to get rid of the denominator: 510 + 0.94B = 0.886 * (600 + B) Expanding the right side: 510 + 0.94B = 531.6 + 0.886B Now, let's move all terms involving B to one side and constants to the other side: 0.94B - 0.886B = 531.6 - 510 0.054B = 21.6 Now, divide both sides by 0.054 to solve for B: B = 21.6 / 0.054 B = 400 So, the shopkeeper bought boxed{400}  bananas."},{"instruction":"29.

To find the sum of the original observations, we need to add back the total decrement to the sum of the updated observations: Sum of original observations = Sum of updated observations + Total decrement Sum of original observations = (50 * 191) + (50 * 9) Now, we can calculate the sum of the original observations: Sum of original observations = (50 * 191) + (50 * 9) Sum of original observations = 9550 + 450 Sum of original observations = 10000 Now, to find the original mean (M), we divide the sum of the original observations by the number of observations (50): M = Sum of original observations / Number of observations M = 10000 / 50 M = 200 Therefore, the original mean of the observations was boxed{200} ."},{"instruction":"Given x, y in mathbb{R}, the statement x ≥ 1 and y ≥ 2 is a (　　) condition for x + y ≥ 3.

By examining the reference solution and expanding on the detailed steps and calculations, we can summarize the solution as follows: 1. **Define the Notation:**     Let's introduce a useful notation for the order of a polynomial modulo an integer:     [     operatorname{zord}(P bmod N) := min { e > 0 mid P^e(0) equiv 0 pmod{N} }     ]     By the Chinese remainder theorem, for a composite integer ( N ) with prime power factors, we have:     [     operatorname{zord}(P bmod N) = underset{q mid N}{operatorname{lcm}} (operatorname{zord}(P bmod q))     ]     Here, the index runs over all prime powers ( q mid N ). 2. **Construction and Claim for Prime Powers:**         We start by constructing a specific polynomial for a prime power ( p^e ):          **Claim:** Let ( p^e ) be a prime power and ( 1 leq k < p ). Then the polynomial:     [     f(X) = X + 1 - k cdot frac{X(X-1)(X-2) cdots (X-(k-2))}{(k-1)!}     ]     in (left(mathbb{Z} / p^eright)[X]) satisfies ( operatorname{zord}(f bmod p^e) = k ).          **Proof:** Verify the polynomial values modulo ( p^e ):     [     f(0) = 1, quad f(1) = 2, quad ldots, quad f(k-2) = k-1, quad f(k-1) = 0      ]     This confirms that ( f^k(0) equiv 0 pmod{p^e} ) as needed, establishing our claim. 3. **Utilize the Claim for Composite ( n ):**          For each prime power ( p^e mid n ), we choose ( 1 leq p' < p ) such that:     [     operatorname{zord}(P bmod p^e) = p', quad text{and} quad operatorname{zord}(P bmod q) = 1 quad text{for every other prime power } q mid n     ]     By using the Chinese remainder theorem, we extend this construction to composite ( n ). This polynomial satisfies the conditions required by the problem statement. 4. **Necessity Condition:**     We now show that if the given condition is met, then the radical ( operatorname{rad}(n) ) must not be the product of the first several primes:          **Claim:** For any prime power ( q = p^e ), and any polynomial ( f(x) in mathbb{Z}[x] ), if ( operatorname{zord}(f bmod q) neq 0 ), then it has all prime factors at most ( p ).          **Proof by Induction on ( e geq 1 ):**          - **Base Case (( e = 1 )):** By the pigeonhole principle, ( operatorname{zord}(f bmod p) leq p ).          - **Induction Step (Assume true for ( e-1 )):** Let:       [       k = operatorname{zord}(P bmod p^{e-1}), quad Q = P^k       ]       Since periodicity modulo ( p^e ) implies periodicity modulo ( p^{e-1} ), it follows:       [       operatorname{zord}(P bmod p^e) = k cdot operatorname{zord}(Q bmod p^e)       ]       As ( Q(0) equiv 0 pmod{p^{e-1}} ), the sequence ( { Q(0), Q^2(0), ldots } ) consists of multiples of ( p^{e-1} ). Since there are only ( p ) distinct residues modulo ( p^e ) that are multiples of ( p^{e-1} ), we conclude ( operatorname{zord}(Q bmod p^e) leq p ), as needed.            This necessity implies that ( n ) must have certain structural properties, ruling out cases where ( operatorname{rad}(n) ) is the product of the first several primes. # Conclusion: Hence, ( n ) allows the existence of the required polynomial if and only if there exists primes ( p' < p ) such that ( p mid n ) and ( p' nmid n ).

We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations: 1. The total number of rooms booked is 260:    S + D = 260 2. The total amount of money made from the rooms is 14,000:    35S + 60D = 14,000 We can solve this system of equations to find the values of S and D. First, let's solve the first equation for S:    S = 260 - D Now, we can substitute this expression for S into the second equation:    35(260 - D) + 60D = 14,000 Now, let's distribute the 35 into the parentheses:    9100 - 35D + 60D = 14,000 Combine like terms:    25D = 14,000 - 9100 Simplify the right side:    25D = 4,900 Now, divide both sides by 25 to solve for D:    D = 4,900 / 25    D = 196 So, boxed{196}  double rooms were booked that night."},{"instruction":"A man can do a piece of work in some days, but with the help of his son, he can do it in 4 days.

The total work to be done can be represented as W (total work). According to the problem, when the man and his son work together, they can complete the work in 4 days. So, their combined work rate is W/4. The son can do the work alone in 6.67 days, so his work rate is W/6.67. We can set up the following equations: 1) M + S = W/4 (combined work rate of man and son) 2) S = W/6.67 (son's work rate) We want to find the value of M, which is the man's work rate. We can do this by substituting the value of S from equation 2 into equation 1: M + (W/6.67) = W/4 Now, we solve for M: M = W/4 - W/6.67 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 6.67 is 4 * 6.67. We can convert 6.67 to a fraction by considering it as 667/100 for calculation purposes: M = (W * 6.67)/(4 * 6.67) - (W * 4)/(4 * 6.67) M = (6.67W - 4W) / (4 * 6.67) M = (2.67W) / (26.68) M = W / (26.68 / 2.67) M = W / 10 This means the man's work rate is 1/10 of the total work per day. To find out how many days it takes for the man to do the work alone, we divide the total work by the man's work rate: Days = W / M Days = W / (W / 10) Days = 10 So, the man can do the work alone in boxed{10}  days."},{"instruction":"An industrial loom weaves a certain amount of cloth every second.

In this graph, each vertex represents a player, and there is exactly one directed edge between any two vertices indicating the winner (the edge points from the winner to the loser). Such a graph is known as a tournament graph. 2. **Check for Hamiltonian Cycle:**    According to the problem, no matter how we arrange the players in a circle, there exists a player who defeated both neighbors. This implies that the tournament graph does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle that includes every vertex exactly once). 3. **Case 1: Graph Contains No Cycles:**    If the graph contains no cycles, then starting from any vertex and moving along the directed edges, we must eventually reach a vertex with no outgoing edge. This means that this vertex (player) is defeated by all other players. Thus, by selecting all other players except this one, each selected player defeats every non-selected player. The condition is satisfied. 4. **Case 2: Graph Contains Cycles:**    Let's assume the graph contains cycles. Consider one of the longest cycles in the graph. This cycle cannot include all vertices because if it did, it would form a Hamiltonian cycle, which contradicts the initial condition. 5. **Coloring and Investigating the Cycle:**    Let P be a vertex (player) not included in the cycle.     * Color vertices in the cycle red if there is a directed edge from that vertex to P.    * Color vertices in the cycle blue if there is a directed edge from P to that vertex.    If the cycle contains both red and blue vertices, then at some point in the cycle traversal in the direction of the edges, we must transition from a red vertex to a blue vertex. This means P can be inserted between these two vertices, forming a longer cycle and contradicting that we picked the longest cycle. Hence, all edges connecting P to the cycle's vertices must be in the same direction. 6. **Dividing Remaining Vertices into Sets:**    * Color remaining vertices green if all edges from these vertices point to the cycle.    * Color remaining vertices yellow if all edges from the cycle point to these vertices.    If there exists a green vertex P and a yellow vertex Q with a directed edge from P to Q, then P and Q can be inserted into the cycle consecutively, resulting in a longer cycle, which is a contradiction. Hence, all edges between green and yellow vertices must point from green to yellow. 7. **Selecting Players for the Final Solution:**    * If there are any green vertices, select all green vertices. These vertices defeat all the vertices not selected, including yellow vertices and vertices in the cycle.    * If there are no green vertices, then select all vertices in the cycle. These cycle vertices defeat all yellow vertices. # Conclusion: Regardless of the specific structure of the graph, we can always select a group of players such that every selected player defeats every non-selected player. boxed"},{"instruction":"a week, 450 cars drove through a toll booth.

Let's proceed step-by-step. 1. **Consider the configuration:**        Suppose we have a (2016 times 2016) grid where some cells are painted black. Let there be at least two successful numbers, (a) and (b), such that (a) is the smallest and (b) is the largest of these numbers. 2. **Division with remainder:**    We divide (b) by (a) with remainder:    [    b = qa + r    ]    where (0 leq r < a). 3. **Assume (q geq 2):**        If (q geq 2), consider a (b times b) square. In this large square, we can place (q^2) non-overlapping (a times a) squares. Each (a times a) square contains exactly (a) black cells by definition of being a successful number. 4. **Number of black cells in (b times b) square:**        The number of black cells in these (q^2) non-overlapping (a times a) squares is:    [    q^2 a    ]        Since (b = qa + r), we have:    [    q^2 a > (q+1)a > qa + r = b    ]    This implies:    [    q^2 a > b    ]    Consequently, the (b times b) square would contain more than (b) black cells, which is impossible because (b) should be a successful number. 5. **Conclude (q < 2):**        Thus, (q < 2) implies:    [    b < 2a    ]    Therefore, for all pairs (a, b) where (b) is successful and (b geq a), we get:    [    b < 2a    ] 6. **Counting the successful numbers:**        The total number of such successful numbers cannot exceed the number of distinct natural numbers between (a) and (b):    [    b - a + 1    ]    Given (b < 2a), we derive:    [    b - a + 1 < b - b/2 + 1 = b/2 + 1 leq 1009    ]    Thus, the total count of successful numbers does not exceed 1008. 7. **Construct an example for 1008 successful numbers:**        To achieve exactly 1008 successful numbers, we can color the entire 1008th row black, comprising exactly 1008 black cells.

Let's denote the two-digit number by ( x ) and the integer by ( k ). We need to find such ( x ) for which there exists an integer ( k ) such that the penultimate digit of the product ( x cdot k ) is 5. 1. **Representing the Condition Mathematically**:    The product ( x cdot k ) can be expressed in the form:    [    x cdot k = 10a + b,    ]    where ( b ) is the last digit and ( a ) is the number representing the rest of the digits. 2. **Requirement**:    According to the problem, the penultimate digit (which is the hundreds' digit in general) of ( x cdot k ) must be 5. 3. **General Form in Decimal**:    To satisfy the condition, let's represent it in decimal form:    [    x cdot k = 50 + 10m + b,    ]    where ( m ) and ( b ) are integers such that ( 0 leq b leq 9 ). 4. **Deriving the Possible Numbers**:    Since ( x ) is a two-digit number ( (10 leq x leq 99) ):    - Let's test multiples of 50 since the penultimate digit condition includes '5' when the number is sufficiently large. 5. **Testing Two-Digit Numbers**:    We need to verify legitimate cases such that multiplying ( x ) yields a number with the penultimate digit equal to 5. 6. **Examples of Verification**:    Take ( x = 25 ) as the two-digit number.

We have three rays a, b, c originating from a common point O, forming angles of 120^circ between each pair. We are asked to construct a triangle whose sides pass through specified points P, Q, and R which lie inside each of the formed angles. Here, we describe a detailed construction and proof. 1. **Diagram Setup**       Mark the three rays a, b, and c with their common endpoint as O. Suppose the points P, Q, and R lie in the angle regions formed by (a, b), (b, c), and (c, a) respectively as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 (not provided here). 2. **Parallel Lines**      Draw lines through Q and R that are parallel to ray c. Let these lines intersect ray b at K and ray a at L, respectively. Label the intersection of QR and KL as point T.  3. **Finding Points on the Rays**      Construct a point C' on ray c far enough from O, such that line C'R intersects ray a at point A' and line C'Q intersects ray b at point B'. We aim to demonstrate that line A'B' always passes through T, independent of the position of C' along ray c. 4. **Intersecting Lines and Ratios**      Let point T' be the intersection of line A'B' with segment KL. We intend to prove that T' equiv T. For this, consider the intersections where A'B' meets the lines:        - RL with A'B' at M    - C'O with A'B' at J    - QK with A'B' at N    Since RM || C'J and C'J || QN, it follows that:    [    frac{RL}{LM} = frac{C'O}{OJ} text{ and } frac{C'O}{OJ} = frac{QK}{KN}    ]    Therefore, we get:    [    frac{RL}{LM} = frac{QK}{KN}    ] 5. **Proportional Segments and Condition**      Rearranging, we find:    [    frac{KN}{LM} = frac{QK}{RL}    ]    Since KN and LM are segments intersected by A'B' at N and M respectively, and these are parallel, we apply the Parallel Line Segment Theorem:    [    frac{KN}{LM} = frac{KT'}{LT'} text{ and also } frac{QK}{RL} = frac{KT}{LT}    ]    Hence,    [    frac{KT'}{LT'} = frac{KT}{LT}    ]    This condition ensures that T' equiv T. 6. **Conclusion**      With A'B' universally passing through T, regardless of C''s location on ray c, we can now construct the required points A, B, and C for our triangle ABC as follows:        - Intersect TP with rays a and b to find A and B respectively.    - Use the intersection of AR with ray c to determine C.    - This configuration ensures our triangle ABC meets the problem's requirements, with each side passing through points P, Q, and R respectively. Thus, the described construction and proof demonstrate a valid method for constructing the triangle that meets the problem conditions.

Then for this to be true, we must have:      [      (g + h)(x + T) = (g + h)(x) quad text{for all} , x      ] 3. **Analyze Equations**:    - Given periods 2 for ( g ) and ( frac{pi}{2} ) for ( h ), let’s analyze the following:      [      g(x+2) = g(x)      ]      [      hleft(x+frac{pi}{2}right) = h(x)      ] 4. **Determining Common Period**:    - If ( g + h ) is to be periodic with period ( T ), ( T ) must be a common multiple of the given periods 2 and ( frac{pi}{2} ).    - We need to find the smallest positive ( T ) such that:      [      T = 2k = frac{pi}{2}m      ]      for integers ( k ) and ( m ). 5. **Solving the Equation**:    - To find the common period, equate the two expressions:      [      2k = frac{pi}{2} m      ]      [      4k = pi m      ]      [      k = frac{pi m}{4}      ]    - Since ( k ) must be an integer, ( frac{pi m}{4} ) should be an integer.

First, she spent 1/5 of her 90 on a sandwich: Sandwich cost = (1/5) * 90 = 18 However, there was a 10% discount on the sandwich, so she actually spent: Discount on sandwich = 10% of 18 = (10/100) * 18 = 1.80 Actual sandwich cost = 18 - 1.80 = 16.20 Next, she spent 1/6 of her 90 on a museum ticket: Museum ticket cost = (1/6) * 90 = 15 Then, she spent 1/2 of her 90 on a book: Book cost = (1/2) * 90 = 45 Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far: Total spent = Sandwich cost + Museum ticket cost + Book cost Total spent = 16.20 + 15 + 45 = 76.20 After these expenses, Jennifer received an additional 30, so her new total is: New total = 90 - 76.20 + 30 = 43.80 Jennifer then spent 1/4 of her remaining 43.80 on cosmetics: Cosmetics cost = (1/4) * 43.80 = 10.95 After buying cosmetics, her remaining money is: Remaining money after cosmetics = 43.80 - 10.95 = 32.85 Next, she spent 1/3 of her remaining 32.85 on a T-shirt: T-shirt cost = (1/3) * 32.85 = 10.95 However, there was a 5% sales tax on the T-shirt, so the actual cost is: Sales tax on T-shirt = 5% of 10.95 = (5/100) * 10.95 = 0.5475 (rounded to 0.55) Actual T-shirt cost = 10.95 + 0.55 = 11.50 Finally, let's calculate how much money Jennifer has left: Remaining money after T-shirt = 32.85 - 11.50 = 21.35 Jennifer has boxed{21.35}  left over."},{"instruction":"Add 12_8 + 157_8.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratios of the lengths of the sides opposite the 30°, 60°, and 90° angles are 1: sqrt{3}: 2. Here, BC is the side opposite the 30° angle, and CH (height) will be opposite the 60° angle. Therefore, CH = BC cdot sqrt{3}/2 = 9 cdot sqrt{3}/2 = 4.5 sqrt{3} inches. The area of parallelogram ABCD is given by Area = base times height = AB times CH = 12 times 4.5sqrt{3} = 54sqrt{3} square inches.  boxed{54sqrt{3}}"},{"instruction":"an election between two candidates, one got 55% of the total valid votes. 20% of the votes were invalid.

The other candidate got 2700 valid votes, which means the total valid votes can be represented as the sum of the votes received by both candidates: [ 0.55 times 0.8V + 2700 = 0.8V ] Now, let's solve for ( V ): [ 0.55 times 0.8V = 0.8V - 2700 ] [ 0.44V = 0.8V - 2700 ] [ 2700 = 0.8V - 0.44V ] [ 2700 = 0.36V ] [ V = frac{2700}{0.36} ] [ V = 7500 ] So, the total number of votes was boxed{7500} ."},{"instruction":"Each of the twelve volumes of the collected essays of Clara Hughes is available in paperback for 18 or in hardcover for 28.

To find out how many roosters there are, we can divide the total number of chickens by 3 to find out how many groups of 3 chickens there are, and then multiply that number by 2 to find out how many roosters there are. So, we have 9,000 chickens divided by 3, which equals 3,000 groups of 3 chickens.

The decrease percent in the revenue derived from it is 17.5%. What is the percent by which the consumption of the commodity is increased?","output":"Let's assume the original tax on the commodity is T and the original consumption is C. The revenue derived from the commodity is then T * C. When the tax is diminished by 25%, the new tax rate is T - 0.25T = 0.75T. Let's assume the consumption is increased by x percent. The new consumption is then C + x% of C = C * (1 + x/100). The new revenue derived from the commodity is (0.75T) * (C * (1 + x/100)). According to the problem, the decrease percent in the revenue is 17.5%, which means the new revenue is 82.5% of the original revenue. So we can set up the equation: 0.75T * C * (1 + x/100) = 0.825 * T * C Now we can cancel out T and C from both sides since they are non-zero: 0.75 * (1 + x/100) = 0.825 Now we solve for x: 1 + x/100 = 0.825 / 0.75 1 + x/100 = 1.1 Now subtract 1 from both sides: x/100 = 0.1 Multiply both sides by 100 to find x: x = 10 So the consumption of the commodity is increased by boxed{10%} ."},{"instruction":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} that satisfies a_{1}+a_{2}=4 and a_{7}a_{4}=6, find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {frac {1}{a_{n}a_{n+1}}}, denoted as S_{n}=____.","output":"From the given conditions, we have a_{1}+a_{2}=4 and a_{7}-a_{4}=6.

Determine the smallest positive integer  k  such that for any colouring of the cells of a  2ntimes k  table with  n  colours there are two rows and two columns which intersect in four squares of the same colour.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We need to determine the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that for any colouring of the cells of a ( 2n times k ) table with ( n ) colours, there are two rows and two columns which intersect in four squares of the same colour. 2. **Initial Observations:**    - Each column in the ( 2n times k ) table has ( 2n ) cells.    - We are using ( n ) colours to colour these cells.    - By the Pigeonhole Principle, in each column, there must be at least one colour that appears at least twice. 3. **Counting Pairs of Cells with the Same Colour:**    - Let ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n ) be the number of cells of each colour in a column.    - We have the equation ( c_1 + c_2 + cdots + c_n = 2n ).    - The number of pairs of cells of the same colour in a column is given by ( sum_{i=1}^n binom{c_i}{2} ). 4. **Using the Inequality Between Quadratic Mean and Arithmetic Mean:**    - The quadratic mean (QM) of ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n ) is ( sqrt{frac{c_1^2 + c_2^2 + cdots + c_n^2}{n}} ).    - The arithmetic mean (AM) of ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n ) is ( frac{c_1 + c_2 + cdots + c_n}{n} = frac{2n}{n} = 2 ).    - By QM-AM inequality, ( sqrt{frac{c_1^2 + c_2^2 + cdots + c_n^2}{n}} geq 2 ).    - Squaring both sides, we get ( frac{c_1^2 + c_2^2 + cdots + c_n^2}{n} geq 4 ).    - Therefore, ( c_1^2 + c_2^2 + cdots + c_n^2 geq 4n ). 5. **Calculating the Number of Pairs:**    - The number of pairs of cells of the same colour in a column is ( sum_{i=1}^n binom{c_i}{2} = frac{1}{2} left( sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 - 2n right) ).    - Using the inequality ( c_1^2 + c_2^2 + cdots + c_n^2 geq 4n ), we get:      [      sum_{i=1}^n binom{c_i}{2} geq frac{1}{2} left( 4n - 2n right) = n.      ]    - Thus, in each column, there are at least ( n ) pairs of cells with the same colour. 6. **Total Number of Pairs in the Table:**    - The table contains at least ( kn ) pairs of cells such that in each pair, the two cells are in the same column. 7. **Finding the Required ( k ):**    - If we find a pair of rows for which there are ( n+1 ) columns that, when intersecting the two rows, give a pair of cells of the same colour, then by the Pigeonhole Principle, some two columns will yield two pairs of cells, all four of the same colour.    - This occurs if ( kn > n binom{2n}{2} ), i.e., ( kn > n cdot frac{2n(2n-1)}{2} = n(2n^2 - n) ).    - Therefore, ( k geq 2n^2 - n + 1 ). 8. **Example Construction:**    - Consider the complete graph ( K_{2n} ) on ( 2n ) vertices, which has ( binom{2n}{2} = 2n^2 - n ) edges.    - It is known that we can colour its edges in ( 2n-1 ) colours so that there are no two edges with a common vertex of the same colour.    - This means ( K_{2n} ) is partitioned into ( 2n-1 ) perfect matchings, each of size ( n ).    - Using these matchings, we can construct a ( 2n times (2n^2 - n + 1) ) table where the condition is satisfied.

We need to prove that the sum of the distances from O to the sides of the triangle is at least thrice the radius of the inscribed circle, i.e.,    [    d_a + d_b + d_c geq 3r.    ] 4. First, recall the formula for the area t of the triangle ABC in terms of the inradius r and the semiperimeter s = frac{a + b + c}{2}:    [    t = rs.    ]    Hence, the double area of the triangle can be expressed as:    [    2t = 2rs.    ] 5.

Hence, the answer is a_{n}=( dfrac {3}{2})^{n-1}.

We will do so by examining their choices and calculating the probabilities associated with winning given these choices. 1. **Symmetry Analysis**:     - Let x denote the number Tom chooses.     - By symmetry, choosing x or 2012 - x results in the same expected profit for Tom. This is because the game involves choices between 1 and 2011, and choices x and 2012 - x are equidistant from the center of this range.     - Therefore, we can restrict our analysis without loss of generality to 1 leq x leq 1005. 2. **When Tom Picks 1006**:     - If Tom picks 1006, then Dick and Harry have certain rational strategies to maximize their chance of winning.      - Dick sees that if he picks 1007, Harry's optimal pick is 1005, which will maximize Harry's winning potential by staying between Tom and Dick's choices. Thus, Dick wins if the randomly chosen number is in the intervals {1, dots, 1005} or {1008, dots, 2011}.     - The probability of Dick's chosen number (1007) winning is:       [       frac{1005}{2011}       ]     - This analysis indicates that picking 1006 is suboptimal for Tom because his winning probability will be very low. 3. **Considering the Best Pair (x, 2012 - x)**:     - We now analyze pairs of numbers (x, 2012 - x).     - Since the problem splits the range symmetrically, consider small x (close to 1) and pairs (503, 1509).  4. **Optimal Range for Tom**:     - We examine x = 503:       - If Tom picks 503, then the next best strategy for Dick can be derived by evaluating the choices available to Harry.       - Dick wants to avoid picking an immediate neighbor to Harry’s optimal choice range.       - If Dick picks 1509 (2012 - 503):         - Harry will have to pick a number between 504 and 1508 to maximize his chance of winning, but not necessarily favoring him significantly over Tom's and Dick's choice.       - This ensures that Tom’s choice of 503 is strategically placed to balance Harry’s pick in a way that Tom has a reasonable chance of winning. 5. **Dick's Choice Confirmation**:     - By carefully analyzing when x = 503:       - We calculate Dick should pick 1509 to:         - Maximize his own winning chance considering Harry's reaction.         - Ensure that Harry’s optimal number falls between the two chosen numbers (Tom and Dick), balancing the probabilities.

This rules out the possibility of reduction or cycles.    - Each new point maintains and increases the distance from the origin. 5. **Cycle impossibility:**    - The cycle theory involves the ability to return to the starting point (void here).    - If a cycle existed, we could return to the origin and reverse the problem; however, due to consistent distance increments, this is not feasible.    - If ((1,sqrt{2})) is part of a cycle, it should be possible to traverse back to ((1,sqrt{2})); absurd since legal movements constantly increase value distances. 6. **Induction hypothesis about divergence:**    - From ((1,sqrt{2})), moving under the constraints mentioned, there is no condition meeting the decremented return allowance.    - Therefore, once ((1,sqrt{2})) sets off initially with forced increasing values, no reversal or original approach design allows returning without contradiction. # Conclusion:    - The exploration and theoretical covering suggest that once departing from ((1, sqrt{2})), it’s impossible to revert to this configuration:    boxed{Given the movement constraints, it is impossible to return to the initial point (1, sqrt{2}).}"},{"instruction":"Given that a = 12, b = 13, c = 16, and d = 11, calculate the following: 3a^2  3b + 2c * d^2 = ?","output":"First, let's calculate each part of the expression step by step: 1.

To find the base length, we subtract the combined length of these two sides from the total perimeter: [11 - 3 times 2 = 11 - 6 = 5] So, the base length is 5. To check if these lengths can form a triangle, we use the triangle inequality theorem which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side: [3 + 3 > 5] This inequality holds, so a triangle can be formed. **Case 2: The base length is 3.** In this scenario, the base of the triangle is 3. To find the length of the other two sides (which are equal since the triangle is isosceles), we subtract the base length from the total perimeter and then divide by 2: [left(11 - 3right) div 2 = 8 div 2 = 4] So, each of the other two sides is 4 long. Again, to check if a triangle can be formed, we apply the triangle inequality theorem: [3 + 4 > 4] This inequality is not correctly illustrating the principle, but the intention is to show that the lengths satisfy the conditions to form a triangle. The correct check should be comparing the sum of the two equal sides with the base, or ensuring each side length is positive and contributes to a valid triangle structure.

The cost of grapes is calculated as follows: Cost of grapes = Quantity of grapes (kg) × Rate per kg Cost of grapes = 10 kg × 70 per kg Cost of grapes = 700 Now, we know that Harkamal paid a total of 1195 for both grapes and mangoes. So, the cost of mangoes can be found by subtracting the cost of grapes from the total amount paid: Cost of mangoes = Total amount paid - Cost of grapes Cost of mangoes = 1195 - 700 Cost of mangoes = 495 Now we have the total cost of mangoes, which is 495, and we know that Harkamal bought 9 kg of mangoes. To find the rate per kg of mangoes, we divide the total cost of mangoes by the quantity of mangoes: Rate per kg of mangoes = Cost of mangoes / Quantity of mangoes (kg) Rate per kg of mangoes = 495 / 9 kg Rate per kg of mangoes = 55 Therefore, the rate per kg of mangoes was boxed{55} ."},{"instruction":"Given that the point (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{4}) lies on the graph of the power function y=f(x), find the value of f(2).","output":"Let the power function be f(x) = x^{alpha}.

We are told that the provisions will now last for 25 days with each soldier consuming 2.5 kg per day. Let the number of additional soldiers be x. So, the new total number of soldiers is 1200 + x. The total consumption per day for all soldiers after x soldiers join is: (1200 + x) soldiers * 2.5 kg/soldier/day = (3000 + 2.5x) kg/day The provisions available are still the same, which is 108000 kg, but they will now last for 25 days.

If we start with a rectangle with particular side ratios and divide it into 4 smaller similar rectangles using one of the previous methods, we select the smallest new rectangle in each iteration and apply the same partitioning method to it.    Repeating this process ensures that:    - With each division, rectangles are all similar in shape but different in size.    - After each partition, we continually increase the total number of rectangles.    - No two rectangles remain of the same size. 3. **Constructing 100 Unique Similar Rectangles:**    We recursively partition the smallest rectangle obtained from the previous iteration, ensuring that all resulting rectangles exhibit ratios similar to the original but are unique in size. By continuing this iterative partitioning process 33 times (since (4^{33} approx 3.4 times 10^{19}) and we need only (4^{3.32} approx 100)), we will ultimately have exactly 100 rectangles. 4. **Completing the Division:**    After 33 iterations of subdividing into 4 smaller rectangles similarly proportioned, we will have precisely 100 rectangles, each similar to the original and differing in size after every partition. # Conclusion: Thus, we have demonstrated and verified that it is indeed possible to have a rectangle that can be subdivided into exactly 100 smaller rectangles, all similar to the original but differing in size.

According to the problem, the rates are in the ratio 2:3:4, so we can write: R1:R2:R3 = 2:3:4 This means that for every unit of time, the first pump fills 2 parts of the pool, the second pump fills 3 parts, and the third pump fills 4 parts. Together, they fill 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 parts of the pool per unit of time. Working together, the three pumps took 6 hours to fill the pool. Therefore, in one hour, they fill 1/6 of the pool. Since the three pumps together fill 9 parts per unit of time, we can write: 9 parts = 1/6 pool/hour Now, we want to find out how long it would take the slowest pump (R1) to fill the pool by itself. Since R1 fills 2 parts per unit of time, we can set up the following equation: 2 parts = R1 * 1 hour We know that 9 parts equal 1/6 of the pool, so we can find the value of 1 part: 1 part = (1/6 pool) / 9 = 1/54 pool Now, we can find the rate of the slowest pump (R1) in terms of the pool per hour: 2 parts = 2 * (1/54 pool) = 1/27 pool/hour This means the slowest pump fills 1/27 of the pool in one hour. To find out how many hours it would take to fill the entire pool, we take the reciprocal of the rate: Time = 1 / (1/27 pool/hour) = 27 hours Therefore, it would take the slowest pump boxed{27}  hours to fill the pool if it worked alone at its constant rate."},{"instruction":"What is the sum of the integers that are both greater than 2 and less than 11?","output":"We need to evaluate the arithmetic series (3 + 4 + dots + 10).

Let's denote the weight of strawberries as ( S ) and the weight of kiwis as ( K ).

Given that each type A pen costs 5 yuan and each type B pen costs 2 yuan, and Teacher Li plans to spend exactly 30 yuan, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation: [5x + 2y = 30] To find the possible purchasing plans, we need to solve for x and y under the constraint that both x and y must be positive integers because Teacher Li cannot buy a fraction of a pen. Rearranging the equation for x, we get: [x = frac{30 - 2y}{5}] This equation tells us that for any given number of type B pens (y), we can calculate the number of type A pens (x) that Teacher Li can buy. However, since x must be a positive integer, the right-hand side of the equation must also be an integer. This means that 30 - 2y must be divisible by 5. By testing values of y that are positive integers, we find that there are specific combinations of x and y that satisfy the equation: 1. When y = 5, we substitute into the equation to get x = frac{30 - 2(5)}{5} = frac{30 - 10}{5} = frac{20}{5} = 4. So, one plan is to buy 4 type A pens and 5 type B pens. 2. When y = 10, substituting into the equation gives x = frac{30 - 2(10)}{5} = frac{30 - 20}{5} = frac{10}{5} = 2. Thus, another plan is to buy 2 type A pens and 10 type B pens. These are the only combinations of x and y that satisfy the given conditions and result in positive integers for both variables.

Consider the sequence formed by concatenating the sequence to ( b ), then reverting, and continuing to ( b' ):    [    b = c_n, c_{n-1}, ldots, c_1, c_0, c_1', ldots, c_m' = b'.    ]    This concatenated sequence shows that ( b ) and ( b' ) are connected in the sense required by the configuration's first condition. 5. **Condition 2 - Closure Under Sequence:**    Now, assume ( b in C_a ) and there exists a sequence ( b = c_0, c_1, ldots, c_n = b' ) with ( b' notin C_a ). By concatenating this sequence with the sequence from ( a ) to ( b ), we get a new sequence from ( a ) to ( b' ), i.e.,    [    a = c_0, c_1, ldots, c_p = b, c_0', c_1', ldots, c_n' = b'.    ]    This sequence implies ( b' in C_a ), which contradicts the assumption ( b' notin C_a ). Therefore, no such sequence can exist, ensuring ( C_a ) is closed under the given configurations. 6. **Uniqueness and Exactly One Cell:**    Hence, ( C_a ) satisfies both conditions and is a cell containing ( a ). 7. **Uniqueness of Cells:**    Suppose ( C ) is another cell containing ( a ). By the first condition, all ( b in C_a ) that are reachable from ( a ) must also lie in ( C ) (otherwise, condition 2 is violated). Conversely, if no such sequence to ( b ) exists from ( a ), ( b ) cannot belong to ( C ). This implies that the elements of ( C_a ) are uniquely determined, ensuring ( a ) lies in exactly one cell. 8. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, every element ( a in A ) belongs to exactly one cell.        blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Determine the sum of the value(s) of n for which |3n  8| = 5.","output":"We start by setting the absolute value condition given in the problem: [ |3n - 8| = 5 ] This leads to two cases: 1. 3n - 8 = 5 2. 3n - 8 = -5 Solving each case: 1.

What is the smallest distance for which it can be asserted that there exists a line that does not intersect any of the circles and on each side of which lie three circles? To find the minimal distance arrangement that ensures the existence of such a line, we can analyze the possible configurations of the circles. 1. **Geometry of Circle Arrangement**:    Since each circle has a radius of 1, any circle’s center must be at least 2 units away from the center of any other circle. This ensures that no two circles overlap and maintains the required property that the distance between circles' centers is no less than 2 units. 2. **Number the Circle Centers**:    We can label the centers of the six circles as (C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5, C_6). It is crucial that their projections onto any line are distinct to simplify the geometrical considerations. 3. **Relative Position in a Plane**:    Consider arranging the circles such that their centers form the vertices of a regular hexagon, ensuring all pairwise distances between centers are equal and greater than 2 units. This regular arrangement provides symmetry and predictable properties. 4. **Projection on Arbitrary Line**:    As we rotate around the configuration of circles, we consider the projections of these centers onto a line. Given the symmetry of the regular hexagonal arrangement, any line drawn through the plane will have a predictable transformation of projections. 5. **Ensuring Separation by a Line**:    Since there are six centers and considering any projection or rotation, we can observe that:    - The circles can always be divided into two groups of three by a line that does not intersect any of the circles due to the symmetry.    - A vital fact here is that any separation line that passes through the centroid of the hexagon, and centrally through the arrangement, will always partition the six circles into two equal groups of three. 6. **Conclusion**:    Given our symmetrical and regular arrangement of hexagon modality for the circle centers, there exists a line that does not intersect any of the six circles and ensures that three circles lie on either side of it. This condition holds regardless of the specific arrangement as long as it conforms to the given distance constraint. Thus, the minimal such distance guaranteed by the symmetric setup ensures the existence of the desired line of separation, without intersecting any circles, thus maintaining the condition involving three circles on each side.

Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Step 1: Understand the Construction of Squares**    - Consider a unit circle, meaning a circle with radius 1.    - Let (AB) be a chord of this circle. 2. **Step 2: Determine the Side Lengths of Squares**    - Suppose the length of chord (AB) is denoted by (d).    - For a square with side length (s) that has two vertices on the chord AB and two vertices on the circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to (d) (the length of the chord). 3. **Step 3: Finding the Relationship Between Diagonal and Side Length**    - The relationship between the diagonal (d) of a square and its side (s) is given by the Pythagorean theorem in a square:       [      d = ssqrt{2}      ]    - Thus, we can express the side length of the square as:       [      s = frac{d}{sqrt{2}}      ] 4. **Step 4: Applying Constraint on Side Lengths**    - Let (s_1) and (s_2) be the side lengths of the two squares, with (s_1 > s_2).    - According to the problem, the difference in side lengths of the squares should be 1:       [      s_1 - s_2 = 1      ] 5. **Step 5: Express Each Side Length in Terms of the Chord Length**    - From the relationship (s = frac{d}{sqrt{2}}), we write:      [      s_1 = frac{d_1}{sqrt{2}}, quad s_2 = frac{d_2}{sqrt{2}}      ]    - The condition (s_1 - s_2 = 1) translates to:      [      frac{d_1}{sqrt{2}} - frac{d_2}{sqrt{2}} = 1      ]    - Simplifying, we get:      [      frac{d_1 - d_2}{sqrt{2}} = 1 implies d_1 - d_2 = sqrt{2}      ] 6. **Step 6: Evaluating Constraints on the Chord Lengths**    - For the squares to be constructed as described, the diagonals (d_1) and (d_2) must be feasible within the unit circle.    - In a unit circle, the maximum length of a chord (AB) is 2 (i.e., the diameter of the circle). 7. **Step 7: Checking Feasibility**    - The constraints are (0 < d_1, d_2 leq 2).    - We need (d_1 - d_2 = sqrt{2}). The maximum separation achievable within the circle is from diameter conditions.

We are looking for the smallest n such that P(n) is divisible by 31,997. P(n) = 2 * 4 * 6 * 8 * ... * n Since we are multiplying even numbers, each number in the sequence is a multiple of 2. We can factor out the 2s to simplify the problem: P(n) = 2^(n/2) * (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n/2) Now, P(n) is the product of 2 raised to the power of n/2 and the factorial of n/2.

To find the smallest n such that (n/2)! contains 31,997 as a factor, we need to find the smallest k such that k! contains 31,997 as a factor. This means that k must be at least 31,997 because a factorial of a number less than a prime number cannot contain that prime number as a factor.

Since the product is ( 78445 ), which is a five-digit number, it's reasonable to assume that both ( n ) and ( m ) are three-digit numbers. 3. Given the number ( 78445 ), we observe that one of the multiplicands must end in 5. Consequently, its reverse must start with 5. Therefore, the product ( 78445 ) implies that one of the numbers should end in 1 so as to satisfy the reverse constraint. 4. Let us denote our three-digit number as ( n ).

We can express this using the dot product and the cosine of the angle between the two vectors: [ frac{begin{pmatrix} x  y + 1  -2 end{pmatrix} cdot begin{pmatrix} 0  1  -1 end{pmatrix}}{left| begin{pmatrix} x  y + 1  -2 end{pmatrix} right| left| begin{pmatrix} 0  1  -1 end{pmatrix} right|} = cos 45^circ = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}. ] Expanding and simplifying this equation gives us: [ frac{(y + 1)(1) + (-2)(-1)}{sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + 4} cdot sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, ] which simplifies to: [ y + 3 = sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + 4}. ] Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root yields: [ y^2 + 6y + 9 = x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + 4. ] Solving this equation for y gives us: [ y = frac{x^2}{4} - 1. ] Therefore, the function f(x) that describes the boundary of the shadow of the sphere is: [ f(x) = boxed{frac{x^2}{4} - 1}. ]"},{"instruction":"f the line l passes through the intersection of the lines 2x  y + 3 = 0 and 3x  y + 2 = 0, and is perpendicular to the line y = 2x  1, then the equation of line l is ______________.","output":"To find the intersection of the lines 2x - y + 3 = 0 and 3x - y + 2 = 0, we can solve the system of equations by either substitution or elimination method.

To simplify it, we convert the base. Recall that:    [    log_{frac{1}{x}} 10 = frac{log_{10} 10}{log_{10} frac{1}{x}} = frac{1}{log_{10} frac{1}{x}}    ] 3. **Expressing in terms of base 10 logarithms:**    Notice that for any positive ( x ), we have:    [    log_{10} left(frac{1}{x}right) = -log_{10} x    ]    Substituting this back into our inequality, we get:    [    -1 leqslant frac{1}{-log_{10} x} < -frac{1}{2}    ] 4. **Simplifying the double negative:**    Rewrite the inequality:    [    -1 leqslant -frac{1}{log_{10} x} < -frac{1}{2}    ]    Multiply all parts of the inequality by -1, remembering to reverse the inequalities:    [    1 geqslant frac{1}{log_{10} x} > frac{1}{2}    ] 5. **Inverting the inequality:**    Now invert the inequalities:    [    1 leqslant log_{10} x < 2    ] 6. **Interpreting the logarithm result:**    This implies:    [    10^1 leqslant x < 10^2    ]    [    10 leqslant x < 100    ]    So, ( x ) can be any natural number from 10 to 99 inclusive. 7. **Counting the elements:**    The total number of elements in the set ( {x mid 10 leqslant x < 100, x in mathbf{N} } ) is:    [    99 - 10 + 1 = 90    ] 8. **Calculating the number of true subsets:**    The number of true subsets (non-empty) of a set with ( n ) elements is ( 2^n - 1 ).

We need to show that this sequence can express infinitely many terms ( a_m ) as     [    a_m = x a_p + y a_q quad (p neq q).    ] 2. To begin, classify the sequence ( {a_n} ) into different subsequences based on the remainder when each ( a_i ) is divided by ( a_2 ). 3. Since there are only ( a_2 ) possible remainders (from 0 to ( a_2 - 1 )), and the sequence ( {a_n} ) is infinite, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these remainder classes must contain infinitely many terms. 4. Let's focus on one such subsequence that contains infinitely many terms and has a common remainder when divided by ( a_2 ). Denote this common remainder subsequence by ( {b_m} ). 5. In this infinite sub-sequence ( {b_m} ), there exists a term which is the smallest, say ( b_p ). Since ( {a_n} ) is strictly increasing, ( b_p > a_2 ). 6. Since there are infinitely many terms in ( {b_m} ), there are terms ( b_{m_1}, b_{m_2}, ldots, b_{m_k}, ldots ) all greater than ( b_p ). 7. Because every term in ( {b_m} ) leaves the same remainder when divided by ( a_2 ), we have:    [    b_{m} equiv b_{p} pmod{a_2}.    ] 8. Thus, for any ( b_m ) in the sub-sequence ( {b_m} ), there exists a natural number ( y ) such that:    [    b_m - b_p = y a_2.    ]    Hence, we can write:    [    b_m = b_p + y a_2.    ] 9. Letting ( x = 1 ) and ( a_q = a_2 ) (where ( q = 2 )), we get:    [    b_m = x b_p + y a_q.    ] 10. Clearly, this satisfies the form ( a_m = x a_p + y a_q ) where ( x ) and ( y ) are suitable natural numbers, and ( p neq q ) as ( a_p > a_2 ). 11. Since ( b_m ) was an arbitrary term in the infinite sub-sequence, and there are infinitely many such terms, our conclusion that we can express infinitely many terms of the sequence ( {a_n} ) in the desired form holds true.

We know that on the first day, Louisa traveled 240 miles at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. The time it took her to travel this distance can be calculated using the formula: [ text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} ] So for the first day: [ text{Time}_1 = frac{240 text{ miles}}{60 text{ mph}} = 4 text{ hours} ] On the second day, she traveled ( x ) miles at the same average speed of 60 miles per hour.

This can be viewed as a partial derangement problem:    - Directly behind their sibling (e.g., if a_1 is in position 1, a_2 is also in position 1 of the second row).    - If not directly behind, consider positions that are not adjacent and not directly behind. This reduces the valid placements significantly. 4. **Calculate the partial derangements**: For direct behind arrangements, any sibling can sit directly behind their sibling in the first row, leading to 2^4 = 16 configurations (each sibling pair can either swap or not).    - For non-adjacent and non-directly behind arrangements, this is more complex and depends on the arrangements in the first row.

The transformation rotates around a point by 60^circ clockwise. 2. **Point Transformation and Rotation:** Construct the point ( K' ) (red) by using the points ( C ) and ( G ) such that ( K' ) forms an equilateral triangle with ( C ) and ( G ). Similarly, construct the point ( C' ) (blue) from points ( G ) and ( K ) forming an equilateral triangle. 3. **Prove Coplanarity by Rotation:** By rotating the plane around the point ( G ), the segment ( K'K ) transitions to the segment ( CC' ). If either of these segments degenerates to a point, then the triangle ( KCG ) is already equilateral, and by the transformation rule, no new points are added.  4. **Ensure Collinearity:** Let's analyze the straight lines ( K K' ), which become ( CC' ) during the rotation. Suppose we call the red line as ( k ), the blue line as ( c ), and the one obtained by rotating ( c ) around ( O ) (origin point of rotation) as the yellow line ( g ):     - Every time you perform the described operation around any point ( K_1 ) on the red line, the blue line transforms into the yellow line because the distances from ( K_1 ) to transformed points remain consistent. Therefore, when constructing point ( G_1 ) from an arbitrary point ( C_1 ) (on the blue line) and point ( K_1 ), we necessarily fall onto the yellow line.           - Consequently, since ( G ) is derived from ( C )'s rotation around ( K' ), indicating that ( G ) also lies on the yellow line. Similarly, transformations for other pairs of colors ensure each newly painted point aligns on the respective color line. Conclusion: The transformation described via these rotations results in points of the same color lying on a single straight line, no matter the number of operations performed. Therefore, we conclude:  boxed{text{All points of the same color will lie on a single straight line.}}"},{"instruction":"An investment at 8% and some at another rate annual simple interest.

Consider the points ( A_1, A_2, ) and ( A_3 ) lying on a straight line ( a ). Perpendiculars ( A_iB_i ) (where ( i = 1, 2, 3 )) are drawn from these points to another straight line ( b ). We need to show that if ( A_2 ) lies between ( A_1 ) and ( A_3 ), then the length of segment ( A_2B_2 ) is between the lengths of segments ( A_1B_1 ) and ( A_3B_3 ). 2. Let's construct a plane ( Pi ) that is perpendicular to line ( b ) and parallel to line ( a ). 3. Let ( C_i ) be the projections of points ( A_i ) onto the plane ( Pi ). According to the theorem of three perpendiculars, we have ( C_iB_i perp b ). The theorem of three perpendiculars states that if a line is perpendicular to a plane, then the perpendicular distance from any point on the line to the plane is invariant. 4. Because ( A_i ) are collinear along ( a ), their projections onto the plane ( Pi ) (denoted as ( C_i )) will also be collinear along another line ( a' ) lying on the plane ( Pi ). 5. As ( A_2 ) lies between ( A_1 ) and ( A_3 ) on line ( a ), the projections ( C_2 ) will lie between ( C_1 ) and ( C_3 ) on line ( a' ). 6. Since ( C_iB_i perp b ) and the distances ( B_iC_i ) are perpendicular distances from the points ( B_i ) to ( a' ) (lying in the plane ( Pi )), the lengths ( B_2C_2 ) will be between lengths ( B_1C_1 ) and ( B_3C_3 ). 7. The lengths of segments ( A_iC_i ) are all equal. Therefore, since ( A_iB_i ) equals ( sqrt{A_iC_i^2 + B_iC_i^2} ) by the Pythagorean theorem, the conclusion follows that ( |A_2B_2| ) is between ( |A_1B_1| ) and ( |A_3B_3| ). 8.

The total travel distance of the ball when it touches the floor for the third time is the sum of all the distances it has traveled: the initial drop, the first ascent and descent, and the second ascent and descent.

Hence, the parity (whether the count is odd or even) remains unchanged.    - We started with 1 piece, which is an odd number.    - Adding 2 (an even number) to an odd number results in an odd number.

Therefore, the relative speed between the train and the man is: Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 6 km/hr Relative speed = 66 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s.

This is a classic derangement problem with an additional constraint. 1. **Understanding the Problem**:    - The King remains in his throne, so we only need to consider the derangement of the other 2020 guests.    - We need to ensure that no guest is in their original position and no two guests who were originally adjacent are still adjacent. 2. **Derangements**:    - A derangement is a permutation of a set where no element appears in its original position.    - The number of derangements of a set of size ( n ) is denoted by ( D_n ). 3. **Additional Constraint**:    - We need to ensure that no two guests who were originally adjacent are still adjacent after the derangement. 4. **Formulating the Problem**:    - Let ( f(n) ) denote the number of valid permutations of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) such that no element is in its original position and no two adjacent elements remain adjacent.    - We need to find ( f(2020) ). 5. **Recursive Relation**:    - Consider the permutation of ( n ) elements.

We need to check if (3a(a + x) + x^2) is even:              - Since (a) and (a + x) are both odd numbers, their product (3a(a + x)) is also odd.                  - (x^2) is even (because (x) is even).                  - The sum of an odd number and an even number is odd ((3a(a + x) + x^2) is odd).          - Hence, (3a(a + x) + x^2) is odd, implying it is not divisible by 2. 4. **Conclusion:**     - Therefore, the difference between the cubes of (a) and (a + x) is not divisible by (2x).

For any four of these lines selected, one can construct a Gauss line. We need to show that the five Gauss lines constructed are either concurrent (intersecting in a single point) or all parallel to each other. 2. **Gauss Line Definition:**    The \`Gauss Line\` for any four lines is a unique line associated with the four lines under consideration. Let's denote the constructed Gauss lines by (G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4,) and (G_5) corresponding respectively to the sets ({l_2, l_3, l_4, l_5}, {l_1, l_3, l_4, l_5}, {l_1, l_2, l_4, l_5}, {l_1, l_2, l_3, l_5}, {l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4}). 3. **Hypothesis:**    Suppose two of the Gauss lines (G_1) and (G_2) intersect at a point (P). 4. **Using Problem 585's Result:**    By reference from problem 585, we know that if two Gauss lines intersect, then their point of intersection lies on the Gauss line of any other three lines composing the four used to define each of (G_1) and (G_2). 5. **Application to the Current Context:**    Since (P) is an intersection point of (G_1) and (G_2), we assert that (P) lies on the third Gauss line (G_3). The lines involved in these constructs are (l_3, l_4, l_5) for (G_1) and (l_2, l_4, l_5) for (G_2). By the problem's definition, (G_3) which is constructed using ({l_1, l_2, l_4, l_5}) also contains (P). 6. **General Case (Intersection):**    Repeating the above logic for the remaining pairs of Gauss lines, the intersection point (P) must satisfy all constructed Gauss lines, thus all lines pass through (P). 7. **Parallel Lines Consideration:**    Suppose two Gauss lines do not intersect but are parallel. If (G_1) and (G_2) are parallel, using the same argument outlined in step 4, (G_3) must also be parallel. 8. **Consistency:**    Given (G_1, G_2,) and now (G_3) are all parallel, we can extend this parallelism to (G_4) and (G_5) by the same logic. Hence, all five Gauss lines (G_i) for (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) must be parallel to each other. 9. **Conclusion:**    The five Gauss lines are either:    - Intersecting at a single point, or    - All being parallel to each other. Thus, the essential conditions are met, and we conclude that the five Gauss lines either intersect in one point or are mutually parallel.

Consider the number given on the board, which consists of 99 consecutive ones:    [    N = underbrace{111 ldots 11}_{99 text{ ones}}    ] 2. Analyze the conditions for the game: a player alternately replaces any “1” (except the first or last) with a “0” or erases any “0” written previously. The game ends when the number on the board is divisible by 11 for the first time. 3. Observe the structure of the number obtained by converting an internal “1” to “0”:    [    A_n = 1underbrace{101 ldots 11}_{n text{ ones}}    ] 4. To test the divisibility by 11, consider the alternating sum of its digits. For a number to be divisible by 11, the absolute difference between the sum of its digits at odd positions and the sum of its digits at even positions must be zero or a multiple of 11. 5. Check the alternating sum for (A_n):    - If (n) is even:      [      text{Sum of digits in } A_n = 0 + underbrace{-1 + 0 + 1 - 0}_{text{repeats } n/2 text{ times}}      ]      This does not sum to zero if (n neq 0).    - If (n) is odd:      [      text{Sum of digits in } A_n = 9 + underbrace{0 + 1 + 0 + ldots}_{text{repeats } (n+1)/2 text{ times}}      ]      This structure ensures that the alternating sum isn’t zero or a multiple of 11. 6. Thus, (A_n) derived after each move does not satisfy the divisibility rule for 11. 7. Given each move either replaces a “1” with “0” or erases a “0”, the sum won't be significantly reduced compared to the beginning structure. 8. Since Petya starts, let’s propose a winning strategy:    - Petya replaces the second “1” from the left with “0”, changing:      [      111 ldots 11 longrightarrow 101 ldots 11      ]    - On each subsequent move, if Vasya converts any other “1” to “0,” Petya will always erase a “0” to maintain a number structure similar to (A_n), ensuring the count remains invariant to the 11-rule alternation except covered initially. 9. Repeat as necessary:    - If Vasya erases a “0,” Petya again converts an internal “1” similarly to maintain the cycle. 10. Here's the crucial point: As numbers reduce step-by-step and zeroes manage closely the addition reduces chances for Vasya to set divisible conditions. 11. If Petya can’t erase a “0” on a specific move, it implies Vasya already faced a losing state by producing a multiplicative division earlier in steps before reaching (11). Hence, Petya systematically leads to Vasya forcefully ending at non-divisive positions ensuring continuation till Vasya succumbs to ending the sequence. **Conclusion:** Petya guarantees a win through an ideal planned move structure.

Given that the common ratio is q, and assuming a_{1} is the first term, then T_{n} = a_{1}^{n} cdot q^{frac{n(n-1)}{2}}. 2. **Analyzing the Given Inequality T_{7} > T_{6} > T_{8}:**    - This implies that the product of the first 7 terms is greater than that of the first 6 terms and also greater than the product of the first 8 terms. This situation can only occur if the 7th term, a_{7}, is greater than 1, and the 8th term, a_{8}, is less than 1 but greater than 0. 3. **Deducing the Value of q:**    - Since a_{7} > 1 and 0 < a_{8} < 1, it directly implies that 0 < q < 1.

The problem involves the construction of line segments starting from a single point (O). We are given that from point (A), five new segments ((A B_1, A B_2, A B_3, A B_4, A B_5)) can be drawn.  2. Each new segment drawn from point (A) results in new endpoints (B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5). Let us consider the impact on the free ends, which are points that belong to only one segment (except the origin (O)). 3. Initially, there is a single segment (O A), which has a free endpoint (A).  4. When five new segments are drawn from (A) to (B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5), the endpoint (A) stops being free as it now connects multiple segments. Each of the new segments (A B_i) introduces a new free endpoint at (B_i). Thus, the number of new free endpoints introduced is 5, and the previous free endpoint (A) ceases to be free.  5. More generally, drawing (n) segments from endpoint (A) results in the creation of (n) free endpoints while the previous free endpoint (A) ceases to be free. Therefore, the net increase in the number of free endpoints is (n - 1). 6. Applying the process recursively:    - Let (k) be the number of times five segments are drawn from existing free endpoints.    - Each time the process is applied, the number of free endpoints increases by (5 - 1 = 4). 7. The formula to find the total number of free endpoints after (k) instances of drawing five new segments is:    [    text{Free endpoints} = 1 + 4k    ]    Where (1) is the initial free endpoint before any new segments are introduced, and (4k) accounts for the net increase after (k) iterations. 8.

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula S_n = frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}.

To find the remainder when this sum is divided by 1000, we can use Fermat-Euler's Theorem, which requires the calculation of varphi(1000).

Comparing this with the given asymptote sqrt{3}x + my = 0, we can deduce that the slope is frac{-m}{sqrt{3}}. This implies that frac{b}{a} = frac{m}{sqrt{3}}. 2.

We need to determine the number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional. 2. **Determine the conditions for ( X ) to be n-ray partitional:**    For ( X ) to be n-ray partitional, there must be ( n ) rays emanating from ( X ) that divide ( R ) into ( n ) triangles of equal area. This requires that the areas of the regions created by these rays are equal. 3. **Calculate the areas of the regions created by the rays:**    The areas of the four regions west, north, east, and south of ( X ) are:    [    frac{p}{2}, quad frac{1-q}{2}, quad frac{1-p}{2}, quad frac{q}{2}    ]    respectively. 4. **Set up the equation for equal areas:**    Select one triangle from each side of the square ( ABCD ): one from side ( overline{AB} ), one from ( overline{BC} ), one from ( overline{CD} ), and one from ( overline{DA} ).

Thus, the sequence ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2n ) can be partitioned when ( n > 1 ). **Method 2: Breaking into pairs based on pattern for even and odd ( n )** - For even ( n ): If ( n ) is even, pair the numbers as follows: ((1, 2n), (2, 2n-1), ldots, (n, n+1)) Sum of pairs: [ begin{align*} 1 + 2n &= 2n+1,  2 + (2n-1) &= 2n+1,  & vdots  n + (n+1) &= 2n+1. end{align*} ] The product of these sums: [ (2n+1) cdot (2n+1) cdot cdots cdot (2n+1) text{ (n times)} = (2n+1)^{n}, ] which is a perfect square, specifically ((2n+1)^{n}). - For odd ( n ): Pair the numbers as: ((1,5), (2,4), (3,6), (7,2n), (8,2n-1), ldots, (n+3,n+4)) Sum of pairs: [ begin{align*} 1+5 &= 6,  2+4 &= 6,  3+6 &= 9, end{align*} ] For the rest: [ begin{align*} 7 + 2n &= 2n+7,  8 + (2n-1) &= 2n+7,  & vdots  (n+3) + (n+4) &= 2n+7. end{align*} ] The product of these sums: [ 6 cdot 6 cdot 9 cdot (2n+7) cdot (2n+7) cdot cdots cdot (2n+7) text{ (n-3 times)} = 18^2 (2n+7)^{n-3}, ] which is a perfect square. **Conclusion:** All natural ( n > 1 ) satisfy the conditions that the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 2n ) can be paired such that the sum of each pair's elements, when multiplied together, form a perfect square.

The distance d from the center of the circle to the line is crucial because, geometrically, the minimum distance occurs when |MN| = 2sqrt{3}, and this corresponds to d = 1. 3. **Calculate the distance from the center to the line**: The distance d from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. For the center (-2, 0) and the line kx - y + 1 = 0 (rewritten from y = kx + 1), this becomes d = frac{|k(-2) - 0 + 1|}{sqrt{k^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|-2k + 1|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}}. 4. **Apply the condition d leq 1**: Given that |MN| geq 2sqrt{3} implies d leq 1, we substitute and solve the inequality frac{|-2k + 1|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} leq 1. 5. **Solve the inequality**: To find the range of k, we solve the inequality:    [    frac{|-2k + 1|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} leq 1    ]    Squaring both sides (carefully considering the absolute value) and solving for k, we find that k must satisfy the inequality k in [-frac{4}{3}, 0].

A type R machine can complete the job in 5 hours, a type B machine can complete the job in 7 hours, and a type C machine can complete the job in 9 hours. If 4 type R machines, 3 type B machines, and 2 type C machines work together independently, how many hours will it take them to complete the job?","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work rates. The work rate is the fraction of the job that a machine can complete in one hour. The work rate of a type R machine is 1 job per 5 hours, or 1/5 of the job per hour. The work rate of a type B machine is 1 job per 7 hours, or 1/7 of the job per hour. The work rate of a type C machine is 1 job per 9 hours, or 1/9 of the job per hour. If we have 4 type R machines working together, their combined work rate is 4 times the work rate of one type R machine: 4 * (1/5) = 4/5 of the job per hour. Similarly, for 3 type B machines: 3 * (1/7) = 3/7 of the job per hour. And for 2 type C machines: 2 * (1/9) = 2/9 of the job per hour. To find the total work rate when all the machines are working together, we add their individual work rates: Total work rate = (4/5) + (3/7) + (2/9). To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 7, and 9 is 315. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 315: (4/5) = (4 * 63) / (5 * 63) = 252/315, (3/7) = (3 * 45) / (7 * 45) = 135/315, (2/9) = (2 * 35) / (9 * 35) = 70/315. Now we can add the fractions: Total work rate = 252/315 + 135/315 + 70/315 = (252 + 135 + 70) / 315 = 457/315 of the job per hour. To find the time it takes to complete the job, we take the reciprocal of the total work rate: Time = 1 / (Total work rate) = 315 / 457 hours. This is the time it takes for all the machines working together to complete one job. To get a decimal value, we can divide 315 by 457: Time ≈ 315 / 457 ≈ 0.6897 hours. However, this is not a practical time measurement, so we can convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time in minutes ≈ 0.6897 * 60 ≈ 41.38 minutes.

The constraints are: 1. Each player scores at least 7 points. 2. No player scores more than 20 points. 3. No player takes more than 10 shots. 4. The team scores a total of 100 points. Let's first calculate the minimum total points that the team must score if every player scores at least 7 points: Minimum total points = 7 points/player * 12 players = 84 points This means that there are 100 - 84 = 16 points left to distribute among the players to reach the total of 100 points. Now, let's consider the maximum points a player can score with the given constraints. Since no player can take more than 10 shots, the maximum points a player can score with 10 shots are if they make all 3-pointers: Maximum points with 10 shots = 3 points/shot * 10 shots = 30 points However, this exceeds the constraint that no player can score more than 20 points. Therefore, the maximum points an individual player can score is 20 points.

Let's calculate the minimum total points the remaining 11 players must score if each scores at least 7 points: Minimum total points for 11 players = 7 points/player * 11 players = 77 points This leaves 80 - 77 = 3 points to distribute among the 11 players to reach the total of 80 points. Since we can distribute these 3 points among any of the 11 players without violating the constraints, it is possible for one player to score 20 points while the rest of the team scores between 7 and 20 points each.

How much does a men's Tshirt cost?","output":"To solve this, we need to calculate the number of T-shirts sold for both women and men within a week and then use the total earnings to find the cost of a men's T-shirt. First, let's calculate the number of T-shirts sold for women and men each day. The shop is open for 12 hours a day, from 10 am to 10 pm. For women's T-shirts: - Sold every 30 minutes means 2 T-shirts are sold per hour (60 minutes / 30 minutes). - In 12 hours, the number of women's T-shirts sold is 12 hours * 2 T-shirts/hour = 24 T-shirts. For men's T-shirts: - Sold every 40 minutes means 1.5 T-shirts are sold per hour (60 minutes / 40 minutes). - In 12 hours, the number of men's T-shirts sold is 12 hours * 1.5 T-shirts/hour = 18 T-shirts. Now, let's calculate the weekly sales. The shop is open 7 days a week, so: For women's T-shirts: - 24 T-shirts/day * 7 days/week = 168 T-shirts/week. For men's T-shirts: - 18 T-shirts/day * 7 days/week = 126 T-shirts/week. Now we know the shop earns 4914 per week selling T-shirts. Let's calculate the total earnings from women's T-shirts and subtract that from the total earnings to find the earnings from men's T-shirts. For women's T-shirts: - 18/T-shirt * 168 T-shirts/week = 3024/week. Subtracting this from the total earnings: - 4914/week - 3024/week = 1890/week from men's T-shirts. Now we divide the earnings from men's T-shirts by the number of men's T-shirts sold to find the cost of one men's T-shirt: - 1890/week / 126 T-shirts/week = 15/T-shirt. Therefore, a men's T-shirt costs boxed{15} ."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=tan (omega x + frac{pi}{4}) with omega > 0, the smallest positive period is frac{pi}{2}.   (I) Find the value of omega and the domain of the function f(x).

Solving for omega, we obtain omega=2. Next, we determine the domain of f(x). For tan(omega x + frac{pi}{4}) to be defined, omega x + frac{pi}{4} cannot be an odd multiple of frac{pi}{2}. That is, 2x + frac{pi}{4} neq kpi + frac{pi}{2}, where k is an integer. Simplifying the inequality: begin{align*} 2x + frac{pi}{4} &neq kpi + frac{pi}{2}  2x &neq kpi + frac{pi}{4}  x &neq frac{1}{2}kpi + frac{pi}{8} end{align*} Therefore, the domain of f(x) is {x|x neq frac{1}{2}kpi + frac{pi}{8}, k in mathbb{Z}}. (II) Given that fleft( frac{alpha}{2} right)=3, we have tan (alpha + frac{pi}{4})=3. By using the tangent addition formula, we get 3 = tan(alpha + frac{pi}{4}) = frac{tan alpha + 1}{1 - tan alpha}. Solving for tan alpha: begin{align*} 3(1 - tan alpha) &= tan alpha + 1  3 - 3tan alpha &= tan alpha + 1  4tan alpha &= 2  tan alpha &= frac{1}{2} end{align*} Now we calculate tan 2alpha using the double angle formula for tangent: begin{align*} tan 2alpha &= frac{2tan alpha}{1 - tan^2 alpha}  &= frac{2 cdot frac{1}{2}}{1 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^2}  &= frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{4}}  &= frac{1}{frac{3}{4}}  &= frac{4}{3} end{align*} Thus, we have boxed{tan 2alpha = frac{4}{3}}."},{"instruction":"Given propositions p: For any real number x, ax^2+ax+1 > 0 always holds; proposition q: The equation x^2x+a=0 has real roots; If p vee q is true, and p wedge q is false, find the range of the real number a.","output":"For p: When a=0, 1 > 0 always holds.

(*Remark.* Here,  f^{i}  denotes the function  f  applied  i  times i.e  f^{i}(j)=f(f(dots f(j)dots )) .)","output":"1. **Define the problem and notation:**    We are given functions ( f: mathbb{N} to mathbb{N} ) and ( g: mathbb{N} to mathbb{N} ) such that ( g ) assumes infinitely many values. We need to find all positive integers ( k ) for which the equation    [    f^{g(n)}(n) = f(n) + k    ]    holds for every positive integer ( n ). Here, ( f^i ) denotes the function ( f ) applied ( i ) times. 2. **Introduce the assertion ( P(n) ):**    Let ( P(n) ) denote the assertion ( f^{g(n)}(n) = f(n) + k ). 3. **Sublemma 01:**    There exists ( m_0 ) such that ( f(m) = f(n) + ak ) for any ( n, a in mathbb{N} ).    **Proof:**    We use induction. Notice that there exists an integer ( m_1 ) such that ( f(m_1) = f(n) + k ). Consider ( P(m_1) ), we then have ( m_2 ) such that ( f(m_2) = f(m_1) + k = f(n) + 2k ). Continuing this by induction, we get our desired result. 4. **Sublemma 02:**    For any integer ( ell, m ), we have ( f^{ell}(f(n) + mk) = f^{ell + 1}(n) + mk ).    **Proof:**    We prove this by induction. By the standard trick,    [    f(f(n) + k) = f(f^{g(n)}(n)) = f^{g(n)}(f(n)) = f(f(n)) + k    ]    Therefore, we can get that if ( f^{ell} (f(n)+k) = f^{ell + 1}(n) + k ), then    [    f^{ell + 1}(f(n) + k) = f^{ell}(f(f(n)) + k) = f^{ell + 1}(f(n)) + k = f^{ell + 2}(n) + k    ]    Now consider ( m_{a - 1} ) such that ( f(m_{a - 1}) = f(n) + (a - 1)k = f(m_{a - 2}) + k ) which exists by Sublemma 01, then    [    f^{ell} (m_a) =  f^{ell - 1}(f(m_{a - 1}) + k) = f^{ell}(m_{a - 1}) + k Rightarrow  f^{ell}(f(n) + ak) = f^{ell + 1}(n) + ak    ] 5. **Main Claim:**    There doesn't exist any value of ( ell > 0 ) such that ( f^{ell} (n) = n ) for any ( n in mathbb{N} ).    **Proof:**    Define ( mathcal{A} ) as the set of values of ( f^{k}(n) ), where ( k in mathbb{N} ). To prove this, we'll prove that ( f^a(n) + ak in mathcal{A} ) for any ( a in mathbb{N} ). We'll prove this by induction. For ( n = 1 ), this is obvious. Then, plug ( P(f^{g(n)}(n)) ) and we have    [    f^{g(f(n) + k) + g(n)}(n) = f(f(n)) + 2k    ]    Now, suppose ( f^{a}(n) + ak in mathcal{A} ), then we have ( f^{X_{n,a}}(n) = f^a(n) + ak ) for some ( n,a ) and ( X_{n,a} ) is a variable depending on ( n ) and ( a ). Then, replace all ( n ) with ( f^{g(n)}(n) = f(n) + k ), we get    [    f^{X_{f(n) + k,a} + g(n)}(n) = f^a(f(n) + k) + ak = f^{a + 1}(n) + (a + 1)k    ]    Therefore, we are done by induction. Now notice that the sequence ( {f^i(k) + ik}_{i = 1}^{infty} ) is unbounded. Since they are all members of ( mathcal{A} ), then ( |mathcal{A}| = +infty ). However, if there exists ( ell ) such that ( f^{ell}(n) = n ), then ( |mathcal{A}| ) is finite, a contradiction. 6. **Final steps:**    Now, to finish this problem off. Notice that ( P(f(n) + ak) ) gives us    [    f^{g(f(n) + ak)}(f(n) + ak) = f(f(n) + ak) + k    ]    By our lemma, ( f^{g(f(n) + ak) + 1}(n) + ak = LHS = RHS = f(f(n)) + (a + 1)k ), which therefore gives us    [    f^{g(f(n) + ak) + 1}(n) = f(f(n)) + k    ]    for any ( a in mathbb{N} ). However, this gives us    [    f^{g(f(n) + ak) + 1}(n) = f(f(n)) + k = f(f(n) + k) = f(f^{g(n)}(n)) = f^{g(n) + 1}(n)    ]    Therefore, we have    [    f^{|g(f(n) + ak) - g(n)|}(n) = n    ]    for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). Therefore, we have ( g(n) = g(f(n) + ak) ) for all ( a in mathbb{N} ). For ( k = 1 ), there are no such functions obviously as this contradicts ( g ) is unbounded. 7. **Construction for ( k ge 2 ):**    Consider ( f(k^n) = nk + 1 ) and ( f(nk + 1) = k^n + 2 ). For any ( a ), which is not a power of ( k ), we can let ( f(ak) = ak + 2 ) and define ( f(x) = x + 1 ) for any other integers ( x ) not mentioned. One can define ( g(n) ) to be the smallest ( m ) satisfying ( f^m(n) = f(n) + k ). One can check that ( g ) is unbounded since ( g(nk + 1) ) is the number of integers ( m ) such that ( k^n + 2 le m le k^{n + 1} ) and ( k nmid m - 1 ).
