It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition. Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let’s choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from. I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Model download Define a utility function to download transformer models from the Hugging Face Hub, prefering .safetensors files over PyTorch .bin files. import os from huggingface_hub import list_repo_files, snapshot_download def download_transformers_model(repo_id, cache_dir=None): # Check for .safetensors files in the repository repo_files = list_repo_files(repo_id) has_safetensors = any(file.endswith(‘.safetensors’) for file in repo_files) # Define ignore_patterns based on the presence of .safetensors files ignore_patterns = [“.bin\\"] if has_safetensors else None # Download the repository, ignoring PyTorch .bin files if .safetensors files are present local_path = snapshot_download(repo_id=repo_id, cache_dir=cache_dir, ignore_patterns=ignore_patterns, ) print(f\\"Model downloaded to: {local_path}“) if has_safetensors: print(“Note: PyTorch .bin files were ignored due to the presence of .safetensors files.”) return os.path.abspath(local_path), has_safetensors # Downloading the base model cache_dir = ‘./models’ base_model_download_path, base_model_has_safetensors = download_transformers_model(base_model_id, cache_dir) models = { ‘base’ : { ‘download_path’ : base_model_download_path, ‘has_safetensors’ : base_model_has_safetensors }, ‘target’ : None } # Identifying relevant model layers Define functions to identify linear and embedding layers within transformer models.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you’re aiming for. This method of copying only what’s needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here’s how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. Choosing the Recipe Books: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book (‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’), which you already know, and a target book (‘valine/OpenSnark’), which has the new recipe you want. 2. Preparation: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready ( pip install … is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. Downloading the Books: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. Identifying Special Ingredients: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods (‘linear and embedding layers’) that make the new recipe unique. 5. Getting the New Ingredients: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. Reading the Ingredients: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used (‘loading tensors’). 7. Creating a New Recipe: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. Extracting the Essence: The new recipe is then saved (‘Extract the LoRAs’) in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. Testing the Dish: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something (‘Testing the result’). 10. Sharing Your Recipe: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library (‘Hugging Face Hub’) so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific “taste” or “style” from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book! CONTINUE CONVERSATION: What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the 'quietstar-8-ahead' model is a result of this paper: \\"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc Yijia Shao Stanford University Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc Nick Haber Stanford University Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results.

In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part?

The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment.

So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market.

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same.

We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","output":"To simplify this for you, the process described in this comprehensive code and explanation involves training a neural network, specifically a type of model called a transformer, to refine its capabilities to perform specific tasks or understandings without needing to train it from scratch. This is akin to teaching an existing expert (the pretrained transformer model) new tricks or refining its existing knowledge rather than training a new expert from the beginning. 1. **Choosing the Recipe Books:** The process begins by selecting a base model (like choosing a basic recipe book you know well) and a target model (a new recipe book with new recipes) from which we want to extract refined knowledge or 'recipes'. 2. **Preparation:** Before we start, we make sure all tools (software libraries like PyTorch, transformers, etc.) are ready. 3. **Downloading the Books:** Next, we download these models (recipe books) from a large repository (Hugging Face Hub). 4. **Identifying Special Ingredients:** We then identify which parts of the model (like specific ingredients in recipes) are crucial for our new specific tasks. In modeling terms, we look for embedding and linear layers which can be adjusted or tuned. 5. **Getting the New Ingredients:** Here, we download the specific new model (or new set of recipes) we wish to learn from. 6. **Reading the Ingredients:** This step involves loading the model parameters (or, in our analogy, understanding the ingredients and methods used in the recipes). 7. **Creating a New Recipe:** In the most intricate step, we mathematically combine knowledge from both sets of recipes to create a new, simplified yet effective set of recipes (model adaptation), using a mathematical technique called low-rank decomposition. 8. **Extracting the Essence:** The new, refined knowledge or set of 'recipes' is then saved in a simplified format so it can be more efficiently used. 9. **Testing the Dish:** To ensure the new recipes work as expected, we test them by generating responses from the model, akin to tasting a dish to ensure it has the desired flavor. 10. **Sharing Your Recipe:** Finally, satisfied with the new recipe, we share it with others by uploading it to the repository (Hugging Face Hub) for others to use. This entire process is a sophisticated way of teaching an existing neural network model new skills or refining its existing skills without needing to retrain it entirely, similar to teaching new, advanced cooking techniques to an already skilled chef."},{"instruction":"can you write code for paper S-type speed control curve based on the number of pluses","output":"Certainly! S-curve speed control is commonly used in motion control applications, including robotics and CNC machines, to start and stop the motion smoothly. This approach helps in reducing the mechanical stress on parts and ensures a smoother transition across the velocity profile. To implement an S-type speed control curve based on the number of pulses (assuming the pulses correlate directly to position or speed increments), we can use a piecewise function that divides the motion into different phases: acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration. Here's a basic implementation using Python. This program will simulate an S-curve motion profile by generating the position (in pulses) over time. The S-curve in this context is generated by modulating acceleration during the acceleration and deceleration phases to have a smoother ramp-up and ramp-down. We're using a simple approach to approximate the S-curve by using a sinusoidal function to adjust the acceleration smoothly. Note: This is a simplified example. In real applications, the control parameters and algorithms can be much more complex and require tuning based on the hardware and motion requirements. \`\`\`python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def generate_s_curve(total_pulses, total_time, acc_phase_fraction=0.3): \\"\\"\\" Generates an S-curve profile based on total pulses and time. Parameters: - total_pulses: The total number of pulses to be generated. - total_time: The total time over which the pulses are distributed. - acc_phase_fraction: Fraction of the total time to be used for acceleration and deceleration each. Returns: - A list of pulses over the time. \\"\\"\\" time_steps = np.linspace(0, total_time, num=total_time*100) # Generate 100 steps per second. pulse_profile = np.zeros_like(time_steps) acc_time = total_time * acc_phase_fraction const_time = total_time - 2 * acc_time for i, t in enumerate(time_steps): if t < acc_time: # Acceleration phase # Use a sinusoidal function to ease-in acceleration. pulse_profile[i] = (total_pulses/2) * (1 - np.cos(np.pi * t / acc_time)) / (2 + const_time/acc_time) elif t < acc_time + const_time: # Constant speed phase pulse_profile[i] = (total_pulses/2) * (1 + 1 * (t - acc_time) / acc_time) else: # Deceleration phase rem_time = t - acc_time - const_time pulse_profile[i] = total_pulses - (total_pulses/2) * (1 - np.cos(np.pi * rem_time / acc_time)) / (2 + const_time/acc_time) return time_steps, np.diff(pulse_profile, prepend=0) # Return the derivative as pulses per time step. # Parameters total_pulses = 10000 # Total number of pulses to reach the target total_time = 10 # Total time in seconds to reach the target time_steps, pulses = generate_s_curve(total_pulses, total_time) plt.plot(time_steps, np.cumsum(pulses)) plt.title('S-Curve Speed Profile (Total Pulses over Time)') plt.xlabel('Time (s)') plt.ylabel('Pulses') plt.grid(True) plt.show() \`\`\` # Highlights: - This code generates a time series of pulses following an S-curve profile, which is often desired for motion control to minimize jerks. - \`acc_phase_fraction\` is a parameter to adjust how much of the total time is allocated to acceleration and deceleration phases. Adjusting it can control the \\"sharpness\\" of the S-curve. - The acceleration and deceleration phases use a cosine function to produce the S-curve's smooth gradient changes. - The constant speed phase is calculated to ensure the total pulse count matches the target. - The code uses \`np.diff\` with \`prepend=0\` to calculate the change in pulses (speed) at each time step - effectively showing how pulses are sent over time to achieve the desired motion profile. Adjust the parameters as needed for your specific application or simulation."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] Was Darius the Mede a real person?","output":"The historical existence of Darius the Mede, a figure mentioned in the Book of Daniel, remains debated among scholars. Contemporary historical records and Persian sources from the period do not provide clear evidence of his reign or identity. While some suggest he could be a literary or symbolic character, or possibly conflated with other historical figures from the Medo-Persian empire, definitive evidence confirming his existence as described in biblical texts has yet to be found. Hence, the question of his real-life existence continues to spark discussion in both historical and biblical scholarship."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What made the Parthians different from the Achaemenids and the Sassanids?","output":"The Parthians, ruling from 247 BC to AD 224, were distinct from their predecessors, the Achaemenids, and successors, the Sassanids, in several key aspects. Notably, they maintained a semi-nomadic lifestyle and a feudal system of government, contrasting with the more centralized bureaucracy of the Achaemenids and the Sassanids. Their military tactics, especially their use of heavily armored cavalry and horse archers, set them apart and allowed for remarkable flexibility and effectiveness in battle. Culturally, the Parthians were more inclined towards a syncretic approach, blending Greek, Persian, and local traditions, which is reflected in their art and architecture. This multifaceted identity helped them control a vast and diverse empire but also differentiated their administrative and cultural practices significantly from those of their neighbors and successors."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What happened in Persia between the fall of the Achaemenids and the rise of the Parthians?","output":"Between the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC and the rise of the Parthian Empire in 247 BC, Persia underwent significant transition. After Alexander the Great conquered the Achaemenids, his empire fragmented upon his death in 323 BC, leading to the Hellenistic period dominated by the Diadochi (his generals and successors). This era saw the establishment of the Seleucid Empire, which controlled Persia until the Parthians, under the leadership of Arsaces I, gradually began to assert their independence, taking advantage of the Seleucids' weakening grip due to internal strife and external pressures. This period was marked by a fusion of Greek and Persian cultures but also by growing unrest and power struggles, setting the stage for the rise of the Parthian Empire."},{"instruction":"НАЙДИ 7 штук ФРАЗЕОЛОГИЧЕСКИХ КАЛАМБУРОВ ИЗ книги “The Phantom Tollbooth”","output":"Книга \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" («Привиденский платный проезд») Нортона Джастера изобилует играми слов, фразеологизмами и каламбурами, благодаря чему текст получается не только увлекательным, но и многогранным. Вот несколько примеров фразеологических каламбуров и игр слов из этой книги: 1. **Рыцарь, который сказал \\"ни\\"** - В истории есть персонаж по имени \\"The Whether Man\\", который встречает главного героя при въезде в Землю Знаний. Его название играет на словах \\"whether\\" (ли) и \\"weather\\" (погода), а сам персонаж говорит о том, что важнее не то, какая сейчас погода, а то, \\"будете ли вы погоду делать или нет\\" — это игра слов, намекающая на важность личного выбора перед лицом неопределенности. 2. **Разделенный полукруг** - Нехарактерное использование обыденных понятий, как в случае с \\"Half Bakery\\", где пекут вещи, буквально состоящие из половин (например, \\"half-baked ideas\\"). 3. **Портмантовские слова** - Объединение слов играет важную роль в истории. Примером может служить \\"DYNNE\\" (дин и дым), шумное и дымное облако. 4. **Терраин без веса** - Область \\"Doldrums\\", где люди не делают абсолютно ничего, играет на словах «doldrums» (перен. - апатия, депрессия), описывая место, где активность приходит в полный застой. 5. **Гора без просветов** - \\"The Mountains of Ignorance\\", горы Невежества, образно напоминающие о преградах, возникающих на пути к знанию и преодолении невежества. 6. **Поэтическая окрестность** - \\"The Valley of Sound\\", где все звуки были внезапно заблокированы, и главный герой должен их освободить, это игра слов, акцентирующая на важности голоса и звука в общении и мире вокруг. 7. **Вежливые деревья** - \\"The Forest of Sight\\", где все деревья имеют глаза и можно \\"видеть лес за деревьями\\", что является обратной стороной известной поговорки, подчеркивая значимость видеть общую картину. Эти примеры отражают уникальный стиль книги \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\", где слова и фразы часто используются не только для создания комического эффекта, но и для иллюстрации более глубоких тем и идей."},{"instruction":"приведи примеры фонетических каламбуров из “The Phantom Tollbooth”","output":"\\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" действительно изобилует играми слов, включая фонетические каламбуры, где звучание слов создаёт игру слов или остроумное дополнительное значение. Вот несколько примеров фонетических каламбуров из книги: 1. **Whether Man** – Здесь игра слов между \\"whether\\" (будь то) и \\"weather\\" (погода). Персонаж приветствует главного героя в Земле Знаний, намекая на непостоянство погоды и выборов, стоящих перед человеком. 2. **Which Witch** – Используется игра звучания между словами \\"which\\" (которая) и \\"witch\\" (ведьма), отсылая нас к персонажу, который может запутать путешественников своими словами, как ведьма могла бы запутывать заклинаниями. 3. **The Doldrums** – Хотя это и не прямой фонетический каламбур, название \\"The Doldrums\\" и звучание слова создаёт впечатление пустоты и стагнации, что отражает состояние \\"безветрия\\" в этом месте, где жители не делают ничего. 4. **Half Bakery** – Игра слов между \\"half-baked\\" (недопечённый, сырой, непродуманный) и буквальным значением \\"пекарня, где делают половинки вещей\\". Это намек на место, где создаются идеи, которые не до конца проработаны. 5. **The Silent Valley** – В оригинале игра слов отсутствует, но сама концепция тишины в долине, где раньше были звуки, создаёт контраст между ожидаемым использованием долины (как места полного жизни и звуков) и фактическим состоянием тишины. 6. **Canby** – Это слово является каламбуром, ведь его можно интерпретировать как \\"Can Be\\" (Может Быть), что подчёркивает потенциал или возможности в контексте, где это слово используется. Важно отметить, что часть удовольствия от чтения \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" заключается в обнаружении и понимании подобных игр слов и каламбуров, что делает текст богатым и многослойным. Конкретные примеры могут зависеть от контекста, и иногда для полного понимания необходимо вдумчиво размышлять над прочитанным."},{"instruction":"Hello I'm a twitch creator, My name is CageBeasty, im making a request of new Dragon's Dogma 2 game on rainmaker, I need a answer for this question \\"Why should you recieve game key?\\" please write me a good answer to that","output":"Sure, CageBeasty!

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition. Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let’s choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from. I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Model download Define a utility function to download transformer models from the Hugging Face Hub, prefering .safetensors files over PyTorch .bin files. import os from huggingface_hub import list_repo_files, snapshot_download def download_transformers_model(repo_id, cache_dir=None): # Check for .safetensors files in the repository repo_files = list_repo_files(repo_id) has_safetensors = any(file.endswith(‘.safetensors’) for file in repo_files) # Define ignore_patterns based on the presence of .safetensors files ignore_patterns = [“.bin\\"] if has_safetensors else None # Download the repository, ignoring PyTorch .bin files if .safetensors files are present local_path = snapshot_download(repo_id=repo_id, cache_dir=cache_dir, ignore_patterns=ignore_patterns, ) print(f\\"Model downloaded to: {local_path}“) if has_safetensors: print(“Note: PyTorch .bin files were ignored due to the presence of .safetensors files.”) return os.path.abspath(local_path), has_safetensors # Downloading the base model cache_dir = ‘./models’ base_model_download_path, base_model_has_safetensors = download_transformers_model(base_model_id, cache_dir) models = { ‘base’ : { ‘download_path’ : base_model_download_path, ‘has_safetensors’ : base_model_has_safetensors }, ‘target’ : None } # Identifying relevant model layers Define functions to identify linear and embedding layers within transformer models.

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition. Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let’s choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from. I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the ‘root’ user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you’re aiming for. This method of copying only what’s needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here’s how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. Choosing the Recipe Books: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book (‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’), which you already know, and a target book (‘valine/OpenSnark’), which has the new recipe you want. 2. Preparation: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready ( pip install … is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. Downloading the Books: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. Identifying Special Ingredients: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods (‘linear and embedding layers’) that make the new recipe unique. 5. Getting the New Ingredients: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. Reading the Ingredients: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used (‘loading tensors’). 7. Creating a New Recipe: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. Extracting the Essence: The new recipe is then saved (‘Extract the LoRAs’) in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. Testing the Dish: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something (‘Testing the result’). 10. Sharing Your Recipe: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library (‘Hugging Face Hub’) so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific “taste” or “style” from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book!

Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results.

In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part?

The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment.

How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, Jane's ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day!

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same.

May 15 '17 at 19:35 hint In your last line, factor by sin (theta), replace sin^2(theta) by 1-cos^2 (theta) Figure 8: Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","output":"This document discusses an intricate technique known as Quiet-STaR for incorporating reasoning into the functioning of language models. It's about teaching these digital brains to \\"think\\" in a way that's beneficial for predicting or generating text, thereby boosting their performance on tasks that require understanding or reasoning. Imagine if your cookbook could not only give you recipes but also suggest modifications based on what's in your fridge or offer alternatives when you're missing an ingredient. That's akin to what's happening here, but instead of cooking, the focus is on processing language and generating text that aligns with a specific goal, like answering a question correctly. The core of this technique lies in a process where the language model generates internal \\"thoughts\\" or rationales while processing text. These are not separate entities but part of the model's ongoing task, akin to a chef considering different spices while tasting a dish to understand what might enhance the flavor. These internal deliberations help the model to refine its output, improving accuracy or relevance. The document illustrates this process through various experiments, showcasing how this method, dubbed Quiet-STaR, leads to models that not only perform better on specific tasks like math problems or commonsense questions but also generate more coherent and structured chains of thought. It's like teaching the model to ponder its answers more deeply, using a blend of its learned knowledge and a structured approach to reasoning. However, the document also points out challenges, such as the difficulty in balancing exploration (generating varied thoughts) and exploitation (using these thoughts effectively). Addressing these challenges is crucial for stabilizing the learning process and ensuring the model can consistently benefit from its internal reasoning. In summary, the document is about equipping language models with the ability to \\"think\\" about the text they process, improving their problem-solving capabilities. It's a step toward making these models not just tools for generating text based on what they've seen before, but entities capable of applying reasoning to generate more accurate, relevant, and nuanced outputs."},{"instruction":"mbnmnbmn","output":"Hello!

It's a cornerstone of Gothic literature and considered by many as the first true science fiction story. The novel is composed as a series of letters written by Captain Robert Walton, who recounts the tragic story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a grotesque but sentient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment. Here are some key points and themes of the novel: # Major Themes - **The pursuit of knowledge**: Victor's quest for the secret of life represents the human drive to understand and control the world. - **Isolation**: Both Victor and the monster experience profound loneliness, leading to tragic outcomes. - **Nature versus nurture**: The novel explores how society and environment contribute to the monster's development and actions. - **Monstrosity**: Shelley challenges the idea of what makes a monster, suggesting that actions and society's rejection are more monstrous than one's physical appearance. - **Responsibility**: Victor's failure to accept responsibility for his creation and its actions is a central theme. # Plot Overview 1. **Robert Walton's letters**: The story begins with Captain Walton writing letters to his sister, wherein he recounts his encounter with Victor Frankenstein in the Arctic. 2. **Victor's story**: Victor tells Walton about his childhood, his obsession with discovering the secret of life, and his eventual success in bringing a creature to life. However, horrified by what he has created, Victor abandons the creature. 3. **The creature's journey**: The creature experiences initial kindness from the natural world but is soon met with fear and hostility from humans. He learns to speak and read by observing a family and eventually confronts Victor, demanding a companion. 4. **The promise and its breaking**: Victor agrees but ultimately destroys the female creature he begins to create. In response, the creature vows revenge, leading to the deaths of Victor's loved ones, including his bride, Elizabeth. 5. **Conclusion**: Victor devotes the remainder of his life to seeking revenge on the creature. Ultimately, Victor dies on Walton's ship, and the creature vanishes into the Arctic, suggesting he will end his own life. # Characters - **Victor Frankenstein**: The ambitious scientist who creates the creature. His obsession with creating life and his subsequent rejection of his creation drive the plot. - **The Creature**: Often called \\"Frankenstein's monster,\\" he is intelligent and articulate but rejected by society because of his appearance. - **Robert Walton**: The captain who rescues Victor in the Arctic, serving as a framing device for the narrative. - **Elizabeth Lavenza**: Victor’s cousin and love interest, whose tragic fate is central to the novel's climax. - **Henry Clerval**: Victor’s best friend, representing the human warmth and compassion absent in Victor's life. # Frankenstein's Legacy *Frankenstein* has had a profound impact on literature and popular culture, inspiring countless adaptations and reinterpretations. Its themes of the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition, the ethical limits of experimentation, the responsibilities of creators, and the societal rejection of those who are different remain relevant today.

Therefore, the correct choice based on the activities not directly mentioned or focused on would be: C. Celebrating holidays.

He does this after observing their poverty and struggles, showing empathy and a desire to aid them despite his own hardships. This act of kindness, done anonymously and without any expectation of reward, shows that the creature possesses an innate sense of goodness and understands the concept of moral actions. It also highlights the creature’s capacity for compassion, directly contrasting with the horror and fear his appearance inspires in those who see him. This discrepancy between his outward appearance and inner goodness is a central theme in Shelley's novel, exploring ideas about the nature of humanity and the superficiality of societal judgments."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical court case, United States v. United States where the gov sued itself for failing to pay debt","output":"In a hypothetical scenario where \\"United States v. United States\\" describes a court case involving the government suing itself for failing to pay debt, we would be navigating uncharted legal territory with significant constitutional implications. Although this situation is highly unlikely, contemplating it can offer insights into the separation of powers, federalism, and the principle of sovereign immunity. # Separation of Powers and Federalism The United States federal government is divided into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. Each has distinct powers and responsibilities, with checks and balances in place to prevent abuses. The scenario where one branch sues another or the federal entity sues itself raises questions about the separation of powers. It's hard to imagine a scenario within the current constitutional framework where such a case would be considered, as it would imply a significant conflict within the federal government's operations. In terms of federalism, the United States is also a union of states, each with its government. The federal government suing itself over debt could potentially involve conflicts between state and federal law or finances, but again, the constitution provides ways to resolve such disputes without needing to resort to the federal government suing itself. # Sovereign Immunity Sovereign immunity is a principle that prevents the government or its subdivisions (states, agencies) from being sued without their consent. For the federal government to sue itself, it would have to waive its sovereign immunity, a complex and unlikely scenario. Federal law, including the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), outlines specific conditions under which the government can be sued, and these do not include a provision for the government to take legal action against itself. # Practical Considerations and Precedents There are no real precedents for a \\"United States v. United States\\" lawsuit involving debt payment. The closest scenarios might involve disputes between federal agencies or between states and the federal government, but these are handled through existing legal and administrative frameworks designed to address such conflicts without resorting to the courts in a manner suggesting the government is taking legal action against itself. # Theoretical Resolution In this purely hypothetical scenario, such a case would likely be resolved through political and administrative mechanisms rather than judicial ones. Congress, responsible for federal budgeting and debt management, would need to address the underlying issues leading to the failure to pay debt. Alternatively, executive agencies involved in managing finances might seek resolution through internal government processes. # Conclusion While it's an interesting thought experiment to consider the United States government suing itself over failing to pay debt, the real-world legal and constitutional frameworks make such a situation highly improbable. Existing mechanisms for resolving intergovernmental disputes and managing government debt are designed to prevent precisely this kind of legal paradox."},{"instruction":"Scenario.","output":"Given the interest in contemplating how a scenario involving the United States government suing itself might unfold, let's delve into a hypothetical scenario that could theoretically give rise to such an unprecedented situation, along with its potential resolution pathways. # Background Imagine a situation where a significant administrative error or a severe lapse in governance leads to a specific branch of the U.S. federal government (for instance, an executive agency) failing to make mandatory payments to another branch or agency. This error might stem from conflicting interpretations of a new financial regulation that was poorly drafted and ambiguously implemented. # Scenario Unfolding Initial Conflict The refusal or failure to make these payments has a cascading effect on the operations of the affected agency, which then seeks recourse through legal means to compel the payment that it is owed according to federal law. The agency, after failing to achieve a resolution through administrative channels, decides to take unprecedented action to resolve the impasse. Legal Peculiarities Given the principle of sovereign immunity, a legal challenge directly targeting the government would generally be impossible without the government's consent. However, in this scenario, Congress quickly passes a specific piece of legislation allowing this unique case to proceed to the Federal Courts as a special exception, motivated by the widespread public and political pressure to resolve the financial deadlock that's disrupting government operations. Court Case: United States v. United States The case, officially filed as \\"United States (Plaintiff Agency) v. United States (Defendant Agency),\\" moves rapidly through the court system due to its high-profile nature and the urgent need for a resolution. The Supreme Court agrees to hear the case given its constitutional implications, particularly regarding the interpretation of the financial regulation and the separation of powers. # Resolution In this hypothetical scenario, the Supreme Court might take several approaches: 1. **Interpretive Resolution**: The Court could issue a ruling that clarifies the ambiguous regulation, instructing how payments should be managed and rectifying the administrative error without formally addressing the notion of the government suing itself. 2. **Constitutional Guidance**: The Supreme Court could use this unique case as an opportunity to offer broader guidance on the separation of powers, potentially setting new precedents on how inter-agency disputes are managed, especially concerning financial obligations. 3. **Administrative Remedy**: Rather than a direct ruling on the dispute, the Court might order the creation of a new administrative process or body specifically designed to handle these types of inter-agency financial disagreements, essentially directing a governmental internal resolution. # Conclusion While this scenario stretches the boundaries of current legal frameworks and constitutional considerations, it serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the complexities involved in government operations and the importance of clear legal and administrative procedures. Ultimately, the resolution of such a hypothetical conflict would likely emphasize the need for effective governance, clear legislation, and the capacity for the government to adapt and resolve internal conflicts without resorting to litigation, even in the most unusual circumstances."},{"instruction":"The part drawing should be sketched based on the tool path.

Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results.

In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, Jane's ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day! (Note: Step 3 and Step 8 are repeating, but the (3,7) term in Step 8 is not the same as the (3,7) term in Step 3. ) Fifth Response <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at 20 the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg.

What do we know? - Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. - She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. From these two facts, we can conclude at least that Janet needs at least seven eggs for consumption per day. And what do we need to find exactly? - We need to find how much in dollars Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation and solve it to find the answer. We know: - (16-3-4=9) So our daily profit is 9 times 2, or (9times2=18) Hence her profits at market on a given day are (18). Answer: (18).

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same.

May 15 '17 at 19:35 hint In your last line, factor by sin (theta), replace sin^2(theta) by 1-cos^2 (theta) Figure 8: Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","output":"This paper introduces Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR), a novel framework that generalizes the concept of Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) by enabling language models (LMs) to autonomously generate intermediate rationales (“thoughts”) to aid their predictions on arbitrary text, rather than relying on specially curated datasets for reasoning tasks. While previous works on teaching LMs to reason have focused on specific tasks or predefined sets of tasks, Quiet-STaR leverages the idea that reasoning is implicit in almost all written text and thus can be learned through the task of language modeling itself. Key aspects of Quiet-STaR include: 1. **Parallel Rationale Generation**: Quiet-STaR generates thoughts across all tokens in input sequences in parallel, using a special tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm. This allows the model to consider internal thoughts for each token about its successors, improving prediction quality. 2. **Tokenwise Mixing and Learning Mechanism**: The LM uses custom meta-tokens to indicate the start and end of internal thoughts. After generating a thought, the model mixes the future-text predictions with and without the thought using a learned weighting mechanism, optimizing for better next-token predictions. 3. **REINFORCE-based Learning**: The model employs a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the generated thoughts, increasing the likelihood of thoughts that improve prediction accuracy. This is done without negatively impacting the model's base language modeling performance. 4. **Computational Efficiency**: The authors propose methods to scale Quiet-STaR training procedurally by efficiently generating rationales in a parallel manner and optimizing rationale-related embeddings. The paper demonstrates that Quiet-STaR, when applied to a base model like Mistral 7B using text corpora like OpenWebMath and C4, significantly improves zero-shot reasoning abilities on datasets such as CommonsenseQA and GSM8K. Notably, these improvements do not require fine-tuning on the specific tasks, highlighting the generalized reasoning capability Quiet-STaR imparts to LMs. In summary, Quiet-STaR represents a significant step toward more general and scalable reasoning in language models. The techniques presented here enable LMs to \\"think before they speak,\\" autonomously generating and leveraging internal rationales to improve their predictive capabilities across diverse text inputs."},{"instruction":"Que ce qui fait qu'on que ton âme reposé en paix","output":"Il y a plusieurs éléments qui peuvent contribuer à ce que mon âme repose en paix.

Manque de planification urbaine : Le manque de planification urbaine adéquate peut entraîner une utilisation inefficace des terres disponibles, favorisant ainsi l'insuffisance d'espaces dédiés à l'agriculture maraîchère. 4. Pression démographique : La croissance de la population dans la commune peut exercer une pression sur les ressources disponibles, entraînant une conversion des terres agricoles en d'autres types d'utilisations pour répondre aux besoins croissants de logements, de commerces et d'infrastructures. 5. Absence de protection des terres agricoles : Le manque de mesures de protection des terres agricoles ou de réglementation foncière adéquate peut rendre les espaces maraîchers vulnérables à la spéculation foncière et à la conversion pour d'autres usages. En somme, la compromission des espaces maraîchers dans la commune de la N'sele peut résulter d'une combinaison de facteurs liés à l'urbanisation rapide, à la pression démographique, à la spéculation foncière et au manque de planification urbaine adéquate. Cela peut avoir des conséquences négatives sur la sécurité alimentaire et l'approvisionnement en produits maraîchers pour la population locale."},{"instruction":"Comment comprendre la mixité dangereuse habitat-cimetières dans la commune de la N'sele?","output":"La mixité dangereuse entre l'habitat et les cimetières dans la commune de la N'sele peut être expliquée par plusieurs facteurs : 1. Manque de planification urbaine : Le développement urbain anarchique et le manque de planification adéquate peuvent conduire à l'implantation de quartiers résidentiels à proximité de cimetières existants, sans prendre en compte les implications sociales et sanitaires de cette cohabitation. 2. Pression foncière : Dans certaines régions densément peuplées comme la commune de la N'sele, la rareté des terres constructibles peut inciter les autorités locales à autoriser la construction de logements à proximité des cimetières, même si cela représente un risque pour la santé publique. 3. Histoire et traditions locales : Certaines communautés peuvent avoir des pratiques et des croyances culturelles qui justifient la coexistence de l'habitat et des cimetières, créant ainsi une forme de mixité considérée comme normale ou inévitable. 4. Manque de sensibilisation : Les habitants de la commune de la N'sele peuvent ne pas être pleinement conscients des risques sanitaires associés à la proximité des cimetières, ou bien peut-être habitués à vivre à proximité de ces espaces sans se questionner sur les dangers potentiels. 5.

We'll need to break down and re-assess your process and conclusion. From the given solution, the system seems to be a linear system whose general solution can be expressed as combinations of the given solution(s), particularly if another independent solution can be found or if a particular solution's coefficients can be adjusted to meet the initial condition. Given solution: (x_1 = e^t begin{pmatrix} cos(4t) - 3sin(4t) 2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t) end{pmatrix}) If (x_1) is a particular solution to the differential equation (x' = Ax), and (A) is the matrix of coefficients, finding the general solution typically involves having a set of linearly independent solutions if necessary, and combining them, possibly along with finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors if we're incorporating a method involving them. However, given just one solution and an initial condition, let’s try to deduce the intended method for such a unique solution. **Given Initial Condition:** (x(0) = begin{pmatrix} 7 -2 end{pmatrix}) You’re asked to find (x(t)) such that (x(0) = begin{pmatrix} 7 -2 end{pmatrix}). Your method appears to aim at scaling the given solution, but the correct approach to meeting the initial condition involves using the principle of superposition if you have a complete set of independent solutions or adjusting coefficients directly. For this problem, assuming there is only one given solution (without the general method of solving for (x)), one would typically use the initial condition to find constants in a general solution formula that is expressed as a linear combination of known solutions and their derivatives (if need be, depending on the availability of those solutions). The solution you provided: (x = e^t begin{pmatrix} 7cos(4t) - sin(4t) -2cos(4t) + 6sin(4t) end{pmatrix}) doesn’t directly follow a clear method based on the given setup. **Clarification and Correction:** Without an additional independent solution or further context on (A) or method to generate the general solution, directly adjusting the coefficients in the given solution (x_1) to meet the initial condition (x(0) = begin{pmatrix} 7 -2 end{pmatrix}) is speculative. If (x_1) is indeed meant to suggest the form of the general solution (due to its e^t component indicating a relation to an eigenvalue of 1 and a possible eigenvector or general form derived therefrom), a correct method would be more sophisticated, involving the decomposition of the solution, or checking if there's missing information such as a second linearly independent solution derived from another eigenvalue/eigenvector of (A). Given the information, there's a misunderstanding or misapplication in deriving the solution you provided. For a precise solution, additional context or steps based on a complete set of linearly independent solutions to form a general solution would be required, along with a more explicit utilization of the initial condition within such a framework."},{"instruction":"как удалить папку полностью в debian если не удаляется из-за полноты корзины","output":"Если папка не удаляется из-за полноты корзины, вы можете попробовать удалить папку с помощью команды rm в терминале.

Подходы к составлению могут включать трансформацию фразеологических оборотов в буквальный контекст с учетом прямых значений составных частей, подмену элементов внутри стойких конструкций или тонкий намек на эти выражения через их контекстуально-описательное представление. Одним из примеров этого вида каламбура является персонаж по имени Short Shrift, который игнорирует главного героя, воплощая в себе значение фразе “to give short shrift to smb” (игнорировать кого-либо). Далее автор добавляет слой сложности к этому каламбуру, связывая его также с архаичным смыслом слова “shrift” (период между вынесением приговора и его исполнением), демонстрируя это на действиях персонажа, который сразу же исполняет вынесенный приговор, предоставляя “короткий срок”. Хотя может возникнуть вопрос, насколько молодая аудитория способна подметить и оценить тонкости таких языковых игр, эти каламбуры могут служить для образовательной цели, рассчитывая на то, что взрослые помогут детям раскрыть и оценить глубину и юмор, заложенный в этих словесных играх. Мило узнает об «Island of Conclusions», куда можно добраться «jumping to conclusions» (делая поспешные выводы), что представляет собой игру слов, где буквальный скачок соотносится с фразеологическим значением «делать выводы без достаточных оснований». Когда Мило, Ток и Ляпсус (the Humbug) отправляются на рынок слов (Market of Words), они видят, как слова текут медом (words flowing like honey), что является забавной вариацией фразы «говорить медом» (to speak honeyed words), подразумевая льстивые или угодливые слова.","output":"Предоставляю дополнительные примеры каламбуров, основанных на устойчивых выражениях и фразеологизмах, для обогащения вашего текста: 1. **Silence Ocean** - это место, где герои сталкиваются с абсолютной тишиной, это игра со словами на устойчивое выражение «молчать как рыба под водой» (keep silent as a fish). В данном контексте море (ocean) символизирует бескрайнее пространство молчания. 2. **Running Out of Time Hill** - холм, взбираться на который героям кажется бесконечно долгим. Это отсылка к фразеологизму «время уходит» или «время убегает» (time is running out), где буквальный процесс бега времени олицетворяется в физическом преодолении пространства вверх по холму. 3. **Catching Z's Forest** - лес, в котором герои не могут сопротивляться желанию вздремнуть, что является отсылкой к выражению «catch some Z's» (поймать пару часов сна). Здесь буквальный смысл \\"ловли\\" Z (от англ. зэд, обозначающего сон в популярных изображениях) реализуется через метафорическую ситуацию в лесу, где засыпание происходит невольно и мгновенно. 4. **Weight of the World Gym** - тренажерный зал, где героям предстоит поднять огромные веса. Это ссылка на выражение «нести тяжесть мира на своих плечах» (carry the weight of the world on one's shoulders), но в данном случае бремя и тяжесть мира буквально превращаются в упражнения с весами. 5. **Cup of Joe Café** - кафе, где каждый напиток напоминает или метафорически является «кубком Джо» - американским сленговым выражением для чашки кофе (cup of joe). Однако, в этой ситуации, кафе буквально превращается в место, где можно встретиться с Джо или любым другим человеком, создавая двусмысленность между именем и напитком. 6. **Bridge Over Troubled Waters** - мост, ведущий через бурные воды, который герои должны перейти, чтобы продолжить своё путешествие. Это отсылка к выражению «мост через бурные воды» (bridge over troubled waters), символизирующему помощь и поддержку в трудную минуту. Здесь метафора поддержки и спасения воплощена в прямом и буквальном смысле перехода через опасные воды. Каждый из этих примеров демонстрирует, как можно творчески использовать язык и его фразеологизмы для создания уникальных, запоминающихся моментов в рассказе, при этом обогащая текст юмором и глубиной."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Вот несколько примеров: 1. **The Whether Man** - Персонаж, встречающийся с Мило в начале его путешествия, называется \\"Whether Man\\", здесь игра слов на слова \\"whether\\" (ли) и \\"weather\\" (погода). Он постоянно говорит о прогнозе погоды, но его название также намекает на неопределенность или двусмысленность (whether) в повседневных решениях. 2. **Dictionopolis and Digitopolis** - Два города, словарный Дикционополис и цифровой Диджитополис, представляют соответственно слова и числа. Это названия отражают контраст и взаимодействие между лингвистической и математической интеллектуальной активностью, выражая концепцию различия между словами и числами в понимании мира. 3. **The Mountains of Ignorance** - Горы Невежества (Mountains of Ignorance) находятся на пути к Замку в Воздухе, где содержатся принцессы Рассудительность и Рассказка. Имена и локация символизируют препятствия невежества, которые нужно преодолеть, чтобы дойти до знания и просвещения. 4. **The Soundkeeper** - Хранительница Звуков (Soundkeeper) живет в месте, где хранятся и контролируются все звуки. Она имеет возможность сохранять звуки в тишине, что визуализирует идею о значимости и важности звуков в коммуникации. Ее способности каламбурят по отношению к тому, как в реальной жизни мы можем \\"хранить\\" или \\"терять\\" слова и звуки. 5. **The Terrible Trivium** - Ужасный Тривиум, демон мелочей и бессмысленных задач, символизирует потерю времени на незначительные дела, отвлекающие от действительно важных целей. Его имя подчеркивает пустую трата времени на тривиальные, ненужные задания. Эти примеры лишь некоторые из множества, которые Нортон Джастер искусно вплетает в свой текст, делая его увлекательным как для детей, так и для взрослых.

Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Søren Kierkegaard 1Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Refer to caption Figure 1:Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot direct-reasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2:Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 7. 2Related Work 2.1Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates.

Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently V-STaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters � with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that � * = arg ⁡ max � ⁡ � � ⁢ [ � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � � ⁢ ( � � : � | � 0 : � , rationale � ⁢ ( � 0 : � ) ) ] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4Quiet-STaR 4.1Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across � tokens � � in an input sequence � 0 : � , we generate � rationales of length � : � � = ( � � ⁢ 1 , … , � � ⁢ � ) , resulting in � × � rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. Refer to caption Figure 3:Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. 4.2Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “ < � ⁢ � ⁢ � > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3“Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the post-thought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”—”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. Refer to caption Figure 4:Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. 4.4.2Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � true next tokens � � + 1 : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � + 1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale ( � � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward � � for each rationale � � as the difference between � � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk and the average across rationales for that token ( � ¯ � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk ): � � = log ⁡ � � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk ⁢ ( � � + 1 : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � + 1 ) − log ⁡ � ¯ � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk ⁢ ( � � + 1 : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � + 1 ) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters � to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇ � ℒ � REINFORCE = − � � ⋅ ∇ � log ⁡ � � ⁢ ( � � | [ � : � ; <|startofthought|> ] ) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, thought it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, ℒ � NLL , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1. 5Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2, as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. Refer to caption Figure 5:Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 5.1Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K ( 5.9 % → 8.1 % ) and CommonsenseQA ( 36.3 % → 42.6 % ) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. Refer to caption Figure 6:Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. 5.2Improvement Distribution As visualized in Figure 5, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Figure 6, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 6Discussion and Analysis 6.1Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these trade-offs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 6.2Examples While there is no explicit pressure in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be human-interpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. For reference, we include a few examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. ’<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride. The chemical formula for this reaction is Mg+N_2-> MgN_2.

In chain-of-thought a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution; Quiet-STaR instead thinks quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. The two methods are likely complementary. For example, in the context where one might prompt a language model to use chain-of-thought, nothing prevents us from allowing the model to think before outputting each token of the rationale. We perform a preliminary experiment on this, suggesting that internal rationales may allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, described in Appendix E. 7Limitations This work proposes a new framework for learning to reason, and in doing so explores solutions to a variety of meta-learning challenges. However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix 7 for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 8Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Appendix Appendix AHyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1 ⁢ � − 6 , a weight decay of 0.001 , and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1 ⁢ � ⁢ 2 and our policy weight is 1 ⁢ � ⁢ 6 . We sample with temperature � = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature � = 3 . Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between � ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ � , we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to � ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ � . Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. Appendix BFaster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes ( � , � , � , � ) and ( � , 1 , � , � ) where � is the number of timesteps ahead, � is batch size, � is sequence length, and � is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape ( � , � , � , � ) , we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape ( � , � , � ) . Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. Appendix CCompute-Adjusted Plots (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 7:Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. Appendix DMeasuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. Appendix ERationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature � = 1 . E.1Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let’s think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers’ market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers’ market. Let’s write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let’s see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer’s market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer’s market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. For the first step, let’s think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet’s ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers’ market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that’s 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we’re given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is Janet´s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you’ve done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let’s say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, Jane’s ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 non-eaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers’ market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers’ market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day!

A: 18 Appendix FAdditional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a code-improver using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes in-context (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning.\\"\\"","output":"This paper introduces Quiet-STaR, a novel method for training language models (LMs) to generate internal rationalizations as a mechanism to enhance their reasoning capabilities. Unlike previous approaches which focus on explicit reasoning tasks or rely on carefully curated datasets, Quiet-STaR enables LMs to infer unstated logical steps directly from the breadth of general text. This approach is a significant step towards enabling LMs to self-improve their ability to reason in a more scalable and generalized manner. The core innovation of Quiet-STaR lies in its ability to teach LMs to \\"think before speaking,\\" mirroring human contemplation during communication. It extends the concept of the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR), where LMs learn by inferring reasons that lead to correct answers in question-answering datasets. Quiet-STaR, however, does not limit itself to a specific task or dataset but applies this reasoning generation technique across arbitrary text, allowing the model to learn from the more diverse challenges present in language. It uses reinforced learning to encourage the generation of internal thoughts (rationales) that are helpful in predicting subsequent text and implements a novel parallel sampling algorithm and meta-token strategy to efficiently generate and utilize these rationales. The paper provides experimental evidence to support the efficacy of Quiet-STaR. By training on internet text corpora like OpenWebMath and C4, Quiet-STaR significantly improves zero-shot reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like CommonsenseQA and GSM8K without specific task fine-tuning. This enhancement is especially notable for tokens that are difficult to predict, demonstrating that the model benefits from the internal reasoning process. Furthermore, the paper discusses the challenges in stabilizing the training process due to the dynamic nature of reasoning reward functions and the complexity of integrating internal reasoning without adversely affecting the model's base language performance. In summary, Quiet-STaR marks an innovative approach in training LMs to utilize internal rationalizations to improve reasoning, offering a more generalized, scalable way to leverage the implicit reasoning tasks across diverse texts. It opens avenues for future research in making LMs learn to reason more robustly and adaptably by teaching themselves from the vast expanse of available text, moving closer to mimicking human-like reasoning processes."},{"instruction":"write an email: Hello, Miss Lily, for the staff meeting today, I can't make it due to a lot of homework, Feiyan","output":"Subject: Unable to Attend Staff Meeting Today Dear Miss Lily, I hope this email finds you well.

Her life and the diary she kept offer a deeply personal insight into the lives of Jews hiding from the Nazis, making her story a powerful reminder of the atrocities of the Holocaust. # Early Life Anne Frank was born as Annelies Marie Frank on June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany, to Otto and Edith Frank. Due to the rising anti-Semitic laws and persecution in Germany following Adolf Hitler's rise to power, the Frank family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, in the early 1930s, hoping for a safer life. However, when the Nazis occupied the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks' situation became perilous. # Going into Hiding In July 1942, after Margot Frank, Anne's older sister, received a call-up notice to report to a Nazi work camp, the Frank family went into hiding. They concealed themselves in a secret annex behind Otto Frank's business premises, along with four other Jews: Hermann and Auguste van Pels, their son Peter, and Fritz Pfeffer. During her time in hiding, Anne Frank began to write in a diary she had received for her 13th birthday, documenting her thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Her writing not only captures the fears and hardships of life in hiding but also reflects on her dreams, aspirations, and her struggles with growing up. # Discovery and Deportation After more than two years in hiding, the group was betrayed and discovered by the Nazis in August 1944. They were arrested and deported to concentration camps. Anne and Margot were eventually transferred to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, where they both died of typhus in early 1945, just weeks before the camp was liberated by British troops. # The Diary After the war, Otto Frank, the sole survivor of the secret annex, returned to Amsterdam, where he was given Anne's diary, saved by Miep Gies, one of the helpers who had supported the hidden Jews. Recognizing the importance of his daughter's writings, Otto worked to get the diary published. In 1947, \\"The Diary of a Young Girl\\" was first published in the Netherlands and has since been translated into more than 70 languages. # Symbolism Anne Frank's diary serves as a powerful symbol of the loss of innocence and the cruelty of the Holocaust, highlighting the human capacity for both evil and immense strength and hope under dire circumstances. Her aspirations, thoughts, and resilience have made her a universal symbol for the rights of the oppressed and a voice against prejudice and discrimination. Her story humanizes the abstract horror of war, reminding us of the value of human rights and the importance of remembering and learning from the past. # Legacy Today, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam serves as a museum dedicated to her life, attracting visitors from all over the world. Anne Frank's story continues to inspire books, films, and plays, reflecting on themes of hope, freedom, and the need for mutual respect. Her diary remains one of the most poignant and widely read firsthand accounts of the Second World War, ensuring that the memory of the Holocaust and its lessons remain relevant today."},{"instruction":"Tell me about auschwitz and how the holocaust had a impact on people","output":"Auschwitz, officially known as Auschwitz-Birkenau, was the largest and most infamous of the Nazi concentration and extermination camps, located in German-occupied Poland during World War II. Established in 1940 initially for Polish political prisoners, it evolved into a network of camps where Jewish people and other perceived enemies of the Nazi regime were exterminated through gas chambers, subjected to inhuman medical experiments, forced labor, starvation, and disease. More than 1.1 million men, women, and children lost their lives at Auschwitz, of which around 90% were Jews, making it a central symbol of the Holocaust's brutality. # Impact on People The Holocaust, the systematic effort by the Nazi regime to annihilate the Jewish people along with other perceived enemies, profoundly affected millions of lives across Europe and the world. Its impacts include: Immediate Human Cost - **Genocide**: Approximately six million Jews were murdered, representing two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population. Millions of others, including Roma, disabled individuals, Poles, Soviet POWs, and political dissidents, also perished. - **Families Torn Apart**: Countless families were separated, with many losing all or most of their members. The trauma of separation and loss had long-lasting emotional impacts. Psychological Impact - **Survivors' Guilt and Trauma**: Survivors often grappled with deep psychological trauma, including survivors’ guilt, nightmares, and PTSD. The psychological scars affected not only the survivors but also subsequent generations. - **Stigma and Isolation**: Returning survivors sometimes found themselves alienated from their communities or discovered that their communities had been destroyed or profoundly changed. Social and Cultural Effects - **Displacement**: The Holocaust created millions of refugees and displaced persons, many of whom lost their homes and communities. Post-war, many survivors emigrated to other countries, including the newly established state of Israel, the United States, Canada, and Australia. - **Loss of Cultural Heritage**: The extermination of entire communities led to the loss of centuries of Jewish cultural, intellectual, and social life in Europe. Legal and Political Consequences - **Nuremberg Trials**: The atrocities led to the Nuremberg Trials, where leading Nazis were prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, establishing precedents in international law. - **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**: In response to the Holocaust, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, aiming to protect individuals from persecution and ensure basic human rights globally. - **Formation of Israel**: The Holocaust was a significant factor leading to the establishment of Israel in 1948, offering a national home for Jews but also leading to decades of conflict in the Middle East. Education and Remembrance - **Holocaust Education**: The global community recognizes the importance of Holocaust education in combating anti-Semitism, racism, and promoting human rights. Museums, memorials, and education programs worldwide seek to preserve the memory of the victims and teach future generations. - **Moral and Ethical Reflection**: The Holocaust has prompted profound reflections on ethics, morality, and human nature. It serves as a grim reminder of the capacities for both evil and resilience within human society. The Holocaust had a deeply transformative impact on world history, individual lives, and collective memory. Its legacy is a poignant reminder of the consequences of hatred and intolerance and underscores the ongoing struggle to build a more just and compassionate world."},{"instruction":"create a list of all the dates realted to anne frank and the world war and hitler and the ww2 abd everything like when the war started and the dates","output":"The timeline below encapsulates significant dates related to Anne Frank, World War II, Hitler, and other related historical milestones.

Where and likely route?","output":"A hypothetical southern extension of the Victoria Line in London could be designed to serve areas that are currently less well-served by the Tube network, enhancing connectivity for South London. There are a few plausible directions such a project could take, based on considerations like demand, geographical constraints, and integration with existing and planned transportation infrastructure. # Likely Direction and Route The most discussed and plausible direction for a southern extension of the Victoria Line would likely aim towards either the South-East or South-West London corridors due to their relatively higher population density and economic activity. Given the Victoria Line currently terminates at Brixton, extending further into South London makes strategic sense. # Option 1: South-East Extension An extension towards the South-East could aim to connect Brixton with Lewisham, potentially serving key areas and transport interchanges along the route. Possible intermediary stops could include: 1. **Herne Hill** - Serving as a local hub and connecting existing rail services. 2. **Dulwich Village** or **East Dulwich** - Providing service to a populous area of South London currently reliant on bus and overground services. 3. **Catford/Catford Bridge** - Another important transport interchange, enhancing connectivity to Southeastern rail services. 4. **Lewisham** - A major transport hub that would connect the extended Victoria Line with the DLR, Southeastern Rail, and the Elizabeth Line (via a change at Canary Wharf). # Option 2: South-West Extension A South-West extension could aim towards Croydon, another significant South London hub with substantial commercial activity and development plans. This route might look like: 1. **Streatham Hill** or **Streatham** - Serving a densely populated area with high public transport demand. 2. **Norbury** - Providing an interchange with Southern Rail services. 3. **Thornton Heath** - Serving another residential area and potentially improving transport links to Croydon University Hospital. 4. **West Croydon**/*East Croydon* - Final stop at one of Croydon's major transport interchanges, connecting with tram services, bus services, and National Rail. # Considerations - **Funding and Feasibility**: Major infrastructure projects in London are highly costly and need substantial justification through demand and economic benefit analyses. Funding would likely require public and private investment. - **Integration with Other Plans**: Any extension would need to consider other ongoing and future transport projects, such as the planned expansion of the DLR and the proposed Bakerloo line extension. - **Environmental and Community Impact**: High-density areas might benefit significantly from improved public transport, but projects would need to carefully negotiate issues of land use, displacement, and environmental impact. # Conclusion While these ideas are purely speculative and based on strategic considerations, any actual plan for extending the Victoria Line or other parts of the London Underground network would undergo detailed feasibility studies, public consultations, and financial analyses. The decision would ultimately balance improvements in connectivity and capacity with considerations of cost, environmental impact, and community feedback."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Transport Project: What would a Bristol Metro need in terms of new construction? (Use exisiting rail infrastructure as far as possible)","output":"Creating a metro system for Bristol, a city known for its rich maritime history and vibrant culture but also for its challenging topography and traffic congestion, would require a multifaceted approach. Incorporating existing rail infrastructure as much as possible, the project would still necessitate significant new construction and modifications to create a fully functional and efficient metro system. Here's an outline of what such a project might involve: # 1. Upgrading Existing Rail Lines - **Electrification and Double Tracking:** Many existing rail lines around Bristol may require electrification to support a frequent metro service. Additionally, sections of single track would likely need upgrading to double track to increase capacity and reduce wait times. - **Signalling Upgrades:** State-of-the-art signalling systems would be essential to safely manage increased train frequencies. # 2. New Stations and Existing Station Overhauls - **Accessibility Upgrades:** Existing stations would need to be made fully accessible, with the addition of lifts, improved lighting, and clearer signage. - **New Metro Stations:** To fill gaps in the network and serve densely populated areas better, new stations would be required. These stations should be compact and integrated into the urban fabric to encourage foot traffic and connections with bus services. - **Park and Ride Facilities:** Outskirts stations could benefit from Park and Ride facilities to encourage commuters from surrounding areas to use the metro. # 3. Integration with Other Modes of Transport - **Bus Service Integration:** A key aspect of the metro project would be seamless integration with Bristol’s bus network, including real-time information and ticketing compatibility. - **Cycling Infrastructure:** Secure bike storage and cycling lanes leading to and from stations would encourage eco-friendly first and last-mile connectivity. # 4. Additional Rail Lines or Tunnels - **Cross-City Connections:** Depending on the layout of existing infrastructure, new rail lines or tunnels might be necessary to create efficient cross-city routes, avoiding bottlenecks and reducing the need for transfers. - **Waterfront Line:** Considering Bristol's geography, a metro line serving the waterfront areas could revitalize neighborhoods and boost tourism but might require new tracks or even underground sections. # 5.

Urban Planning and Community Impact - **Public Consultation:** Engaging with communities from the planning stage to implementation would be crucial to address concerns and incorporate local insights. - **Zoning and Development:** Metro construction could be coordinated with urban development projects, using the transport upgrades to stimulate housing and commercial opportunities around stations. # Conclusion Developing a metro for Bristol that leverages existing rail infrastructure would still be a significant undertaking requiring careful planning, considerable investment, and collaboration between different levels of government, the private sector, and the community. It would not only involve technical and infrastructure upgrades but also a holistic approach to urban mobility, aiming to create a more connected, accessible, and sustainable city."},{"instruction":"Build a pre-metro/tram system in Brighton and Hove , ( Use the same gauge as Volks railway)..","output":"Building a pre-metro/tram system in Brighton and Hove, using the same gauge as the historic Volk's Electric Railway (which is standard gauge, 1,435 mm), sets a unique precedent for integrating modern transportation solutions with an established tourist attraction. This initiative could significantly enhance local mobility, leveraging a unique part of the city's heritage. Here is an outline for such a project: # 1. **Infrastructure Planning** **Identify Main Corridors and Stops**: Key corridors would likely include routes serving major residential, commercial, and tourist areas such as Brighton city center, Hove, Brighton Marina, and universities. Stops would be strategically located at key points of interest, commuter hubs, and residential areas to maximize coverage and convenience. **Track Construction**: Given this is a new tram system, constructing dedicated tram lines or shared roadways aligned with the gauge of Volk's Railway is crucial. These tracks would enable smooth transitions between different parts of the city while minimizing disruption to existing road traffic. **Integration with Volk's Railway**: Utilizing the same gauge enables the potential for physical and operational integration with Volk's Railway, transforming it from a tourist attraction into a functional part of the city's public transport network. # 2. **Vehicle Procurement** **Acquiring Modern Trams**: The system would require a fleet of modern, low-floor trams for accessibility, capable of operating at a higher speed and frequency than the historic Volk's Railway trains. These vehicles would be designed to reflect Brighton and Hove's vibrant urban culture and environmental sustainability goals. # 3. **Station Design** **Accessibility and Amenities**: Stations need to be fully accessible, with step-free access, real-time information displays, ticketing machines, and shelter. Provisions for bicycles, offering facilities like bike racks or bike hire stations, would encourage multimodal transport use. **Heritage Integration**: The design of stations and tram livery could incorporate elements that reflect the city's seaside heritage and the historical significance of Volk's Railway. # 4. **Urban Integration** **Street and Pedestrian Area Upgrades**: Implementing the tram system will provide an opportunity to enhance urban spaces, potentially pedestrianizing more areas, upgrading landscaping, and improving street furniture in line with the new tram infrastructure. **Multimodal Connections**: Ensuring that tram stops are co-located with bus stops where possible, and close to car parks for park-and-ride facilities, would improve the system's integration with other transport modes. # 5. **Operational Considerations** **Frequency and Timetable**: The tram service would need to offer a high frequency, especially during peak times and in the summer months when tourist activity is high. **Pricing and Ticketing**: Implementing a simple, straightforward pricing and ticketing system, possibly integrated with other local transport services, would be essential for encouraging adoption. # 6. **Community and Environmental Benefits** **Public Consultation**: Engaging with local communities, businesses, and stakeholders right from the planning stage to gather input and address concerns. **Sustainability Focus**: By promoting public transport and potentially reducing car usage, the tram system would contribute to lower emissions and less congestion, aligning with broader environmental objectives. # Conclusion A pre-metro/tram system in Brighton and Hove, designed with careful consideration for the city's unique culture, heritage, and modern transport needs, could significantly enhance local mobility and sustainability. By using the same gauge as the Volk's Electric Railway, the project taps into a piece of the city's history, turning it into a cornerstone of future public transport infrastructure."},{"instruction":"Please summarize with a deep understanding: \\"\\" arXiv:2403.09629v1 [cs.CL] 14 Mar 2024 UseRawInputEncoding Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University &Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc &Yijia Shao Stanford University &Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc &Nick Haber Stanford University &Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Søren Kierkegaard 1Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Refer to caption Figure 1:Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot direct-reasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts.

In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 7. 2Related Work 2.1Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. _ ⁢ steps Algorithm 1 Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) 2.2Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently V-STaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters � with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4Quiet-STaR 4.1Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across � tokens � � in an input sequence � 0 : � , we generate � rationales of length � : � � = ( � � ⁢ 1 , … , � � ⁢ � ) , resulting in � × � rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. Refer to caption Figure 3:Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. 4.2Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “ < the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3“Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the post-thought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”—”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. Refer to caption Figure 4:Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. 4.4.2Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, thought it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, ℒ � NLL , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1. 5Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2, as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. Refer to caption Figure 5:Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 5.1Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K ( 5.9 % → 8.1 % ) and CommonsenseQA ( 36.3 % → 42.6 % ) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. Refer to caption Figure 6:Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. 5.2Improvement Distribution As visualized in Figure 5, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Figure 6, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 6Discussion and Analysis 6.1Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these trade-offs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 6.2Examples While there is no explicit pressure in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be human-interpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. For reference, we include a few examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. ’<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride. The chemical formula for this reaction is Mg+N_2-> MgN_2.

In chain-of-thought a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution; Quiet-STaR instead thinks quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. The two methods are likely complementary. For example, in the context where one might prompt a language model to use chain-of-thought, nothing prevents us from allowing the model to think before outputting each token of the rationale. We perform a preliminary experiment on this, suggesting that internal rationales may allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, described in Appendix E. 7Limitations This work proposes a new framework for learning to reason, and in doing so explores solutions to a variety of meta-learning challenges. However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix 7 for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 8Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of . Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. Appendix CCompute-Adjusted Plots (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 7:Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. Appendix DMeasuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. Appendix ERationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature � = 1 . E.1Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let’s think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers’ market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers’ market. Let’s write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let’s see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer’s market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer’s market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. For the first step, let’s think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet’s ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers’ market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that’s 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we’re given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is Janet´s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you’ve done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part?

The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let’s say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment.

A: 18 Appendix FAdditional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a code-improver using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes in-context (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning.","output":"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking,\\" authored by Eric Zelikman and others from Stanford University and Notbad AI Inc, introduces a novel approach for improving language models (LMs) through self-taught reasoning abilities derived from general text. It builds on and extends the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) framework introduced in previous works, aiming to imbue LMs with the capability to infer unstated rationales or underlying reasoning in texts to make better predictions. The core insight driving the work is that reasoning is an implicit aspect of all written text, not just explicit question-answering (QA) or problem-solving contexts. This realization opens up the possibility of leveraging the vast sea of unstructured text available on the Internet as a learning ground for language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities. The method, dubbed Quiet-STaR, has LMs self-generate rationales at every token in a given text, explaining the text that follows, which significantly improves the model's prediction accuracy. This self-instructed mechanism allows the model to \\"think before it speaks,\\" mirroring human introspective reasoning processes. Key achievements of the Quiet-STaR methodology include: 1. **Generalization to Arbitrary Texts**: By training on internet text corpora, Quiet-STaR enables LMs to develop reasoning skills not tied to specific tasks or datasets, enhancing generality and scalability. 2. **Improved Prediction through Rationale Generation**: The method works by generating \\"thought tokens\\" at each position in a text sequence, which guide the model in predicting subsequent text more accurately. 3. **Efficiency and Scalability**: Implements a parallel sampling algorithm and an extended teacher-forcing technique to manage computational costs without compromising performance. 4. **Significant Zero-shot Performance Gains**: Demonstrates substantial improvements on challenging datasets like GSM8K and CommonsenseQA without fine-tuning, illustrating the effectiveness of internal thought generation in enhancing reasoning capabilities. Despite increasing the computational overhead due to rationale generation, the approach presents an innovative way to utilize additional compute for enhancing next-token prediction quality, demonstrating an important step toward LMs with intrinsic reasoning abilities. Quiet-STaR operates under the philosophy that language models can be unsupervised multitask learners, tapping into their latent reasoning abilities to improve understanding and generation of text. It signals a shift towards more intelligent and autonomous language models capable of learning and improving from the vast and diverse content available online, embodying a promising direction for AI research in natural language understanding and generation."},{"instruction":"Please summarize with a deep understanding: \\"\\" arXiv:2403.09629v1 [cs.CL] 14 Mar 2024 UseRawInputEncoding Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University &Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc &Yijia Shao Stanford University &Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc &Nick Haber Stanford University &Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Søren Kierkegaard 1Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Refer to caption Figure 1:Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot direct-reasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2:Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 7. 2Related Work 2.1Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. _ ⁢ steps Algorithm 1 Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) 2.2Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently V-STaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. Refer to caption Figure 3:Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. 4.2Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “ < the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3“Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the post-thought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”—”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. Refer to caption Figure 4:Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. 4.4.2Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, thought it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, ℒ � NLL , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1. 5Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2, as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. Refer to caption Figure 5:Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 5.1Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K ( 5.9 % → 8.1 % ) and CommonsenseQA ( 36.3 % → 42.6 % ) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. Refer to caption Figure 6:Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. 5.2Improvement Distribution As visualized in Figure 5, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Figure 6, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 6Discussion and Analysis 6.1Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these trade-offs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 6.2Examples While there is no explicit pressure in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be human-interpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. For reference, we include a few examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. ’<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride. The chemical formula for this reaction is Mg+N_2-> MgN_2.

In chain-of-thought a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution; Quiet-STaR instead thinks quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. The two methods are likely complementary. For example, in the context where one might prompt a language model to use chain-of-thought, nothing prevents us from allowing the model to think before outputting each token of the rationale. We perform a preliminary experiment on this, suggesting that internal rationales may allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, described in Appendix E. 7Limitations This work proposes a new framework for learning to reason, and in doing so explores solutions to a variety of meta-learning challenges. However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix 7 for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 8Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of . Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. Appendix CCompute-Adjusted Plots (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 7:Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. Appendix DMeasuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. Appendix ERationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature � = 1 . E.1Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let’s think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers’ market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers’ market. Let’s write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let’s see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer’s market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer’s market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. For the first step, let’s think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet’s ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers’ market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that’s 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks.

How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we’re given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is Janet´s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you’ve done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let’s say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, Jane’s ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 non-eaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers’ market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers’ market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day! (Note: Step 3 and Step 8 are repeating, but the (3,7) term in Step 8 is not the same as the (3,7) term in Step 3. ) Fifth Response <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg.

A: 18 Appendix FAdditional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a code-improver using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes in-context (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning.","output":"This research paper introduces Quiet-STaR, a novel approach toward enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Language Models (LMs) by teaching them to generate internal rationales or \\"thoughts\\" as an intermediary step in making predictions. The paper, authored by Eric Zelikman et al. from Stanford University and Notbad AI Inc, posits that reasoning is an implicit component in all text and that LMs can leverage this by learning to infer unstated rationales across a wide array of texts, moving beyond the confines of structured question-answering (QA) datasets featured in prior works. The Quiet-STaR methodology is based on generating rationales after every token to explain future text, subsequently mixing future-text predictions with and without rationales, and employing REINFORCE to iteratively refine the generation of useful rationales. This approach is an extrapolation of the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR), extending its application from fixed tasks to reasoning within arbitrary text, thus harnessing the vast and diverse dataset of internet text to train LMs to reason more extensively. One of the notable innovations includes the development of a parallel sampling algorithm for efficient rationale generation and the introduction of meta-tokens to delineate the beginning and end of a rationale, addressing significant computational and learning challenges. The paper claims commendable zero-shot improvements on reasoning-focused tasks like GSM8K and CommonsenseQA without task-specific fine-tuning, underpinning the potential of Quiet-STaR in elevating LM reasoning abilities. Furthermore, the paper explores interesting dimensions of how rationales are generated, utilized, and the effects they have on LM predictions, providing both quantitative outcomes and qualitative insights. It delves into algorithmic specifics like the parallel generation technique for scalability, the introduction of mixing heads for gradual learning transition, and non-myopic scoring for a broader prediction horizon. The authors conclude that Quiet-STaR paves the way for LMs to learn reasoning more generally and scalably by drawing from the multidimensional landscape of reasoning tasks present in natural language, indicating a promising direction toward developing LMs with more robust and adaptable reasoning capabilities. This lays a foundational step towards realizing LMs that closely emulate human-like reasoning processes, suggesting avenues for future research in optimized compute allocation for rationale generation and the potential integrations with in-context prompting methodologies like chain-of-thought for enhanced reasoning coherence."},{"instruction":"descrivimi una città medievale del 1000 dopo cristo","output":"Nel 1000 dopo Cristo, il tessuto urbano delle città medievali era marcatamente diverso dalle moderne conurbazioni. La città medievale tipica aveva caratteristiche architettoniche e sociali ben distinte, in larga misura influenzate dalla necessità di difesa, dall'economia basata sull'agricoltura e dall'importanza della religione nella vita quotidiana. Al centro della città si trovava spesso il castello o la fortezza, sede del signore locale o del monarca, elemento centrale del potere politico e militare. Intorno, sorgeva la cattedrale o la principale chiesa parrocchiale, simbolo dell'autorità religiosa e fulcro della vita comunitaria. Questi due punti chiave erano circondati da strade strette e tortuose, che si dipanavano in modo apparentemente caotico. Le mura cittadine erano una caratteristica comune, fornendo protezione contro le incursioni esterne. Queste erano dotate di torri di guardia e porte che permettevano l'accesso controllato alla città. L'area all'interno delle mura era limitata, il che portava a una densa costruzione con case che si affacciavano le une sulle altre su strade strette. Le abitazioni erano prevalentemente costruite in legno e paglia, anche se nelle regioni più ricche si potevano trovare costruzioni in pietra. Gli spazi commerciali erano concentrati nei mercati all'aperto o lungo le strade principali, dove artigiani, mercanti e venditori offrivano i loro beni e servizi. Era comune la presenza di gilde, associazioni di artigiani e commercianti che regolavano la produzione e il commercio di determinate merci, proteggendo gli interessi dei suoi membri. La vita nelle città medievali era fortemente influenzata dall'agricoltura, con grandi aree di terra coltivata circostanti. Le strade principali portavano alla campagna circostante, facilitando il commercio e il movimento delle persone. I servizi igienici erano molto rudimentali e le condizioni sanitarie precarie. L'acqua potabile proveniva solitamente da pozzi pubblici o fiumi, e non era raro per le malattie diffondersi rapidamente attraverso le aree densamente popolate. A livello sociale, la popolazione era stratificata in classi ben definite: l'aristocrazia e l'alta chiesa detenevano il potere e le ricchezze, mentre artigiani, mercanti e contadini formavano la maggioranza della popolazione. I servi e gli schiavi erano presenti, sebbene il loro status variasse in base alle leggi e alle usanze locali. In conclusione, le città medievali del 1000 d.C. erano centri di potere politico, economico e religioso, caratterizzate da una marcata strutturazione sociale e una densità abitativa che rendeva la vita cittadina vibrante ma anche impegnativa."},{"instruction":"undefined, create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","output":"\\"Best Summer Reads: Page-Turning Novels for Sunny Days Ahead\\""},{"instruction":"Best Summer Reads: Page-Turning Novels for Sunny Days Ahead, generate a personal experience with this, add hash tag at the bottom, less than 700 characters only, only strings, no </br> html","output":"Last summer, I dove into the world of captivating novels perfect for sunny days.

It goes beyond simply knowing how an algorithm generates predictions (which is often the focus of model interpretability) to understanding why those predictions make sense in a concrete, real-world framework. While much of the focus in AI interpretability (also known as explainable AI or XAI) is on creating models that are transparent or whose outputs can be explained post hoc in human-understandable terms, mechanistic interpretability pushes further. It involves crafting or analyzing models so that their inner workings not only predict outcomes accurately but also reflect the causal processes or theoretical principles underlying the systems they simulate or analyze. For example, in a biomedical application, a mechanistically interpretable model would not only predict disease outcomes based on various inputs but also do so in a way that aligns with existing medical knowledge about disease pathways and physiological interactions. This is in contrast to many \\"black box\\" models that may offer high predictive accuracy without any clear connection to the underlying biological or chemical processes. The benefits of mechanistic interpretability include: 1. **Enhanced Trust**: Users can have greater confidence in model outputs when they align with known mechanisms or theories. 2. **Improved Safety and Reliability**: Insights into how models work can help anticipate and mitigate failures or unintended consequences, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare or autonomous driving. 3. **Facilitated Innovation**: Mechanistic insights can reveal gaps in current knowledge, suggesting new experiments or lines of inquiry. 4. **Regulatory Compliance**: In fields with stringent regulatory requirements, demonstrating that models adhere to known principles can be necessary. 5. **Educational Value**: These models can help users learn about the systems being modeled, offering insights into both the models and the phenomena they simulate. Achieving mechanistic interpretability can be challenging, especially with complex AI models like deep neural networks, which are often described as \\"black boxes\\" because their internal workings are opaque and not easily mapped onto real-world concepts. Methods to improve mechanistic interpretability include the development of more transparent model architectures, the incorporation of domain knowledge into model design (e.g., through feature engineering or model constraints), and the use of techniques like causal inference to more directly model the underlying processes of interest."},{"instruction":"What approaches are available for mechanistic interpretability? Provide also references.","output":"Mechanistic interpretability involves understanding the internal workings of a model in a way that mirrors real-world processes or causal mechanisms. This approach is particularly important in fields where it's crucial to grasp why a model makes certain predictions, such as in healthcare, environmental science, and physics. Several approaches have been developed to enhance mechanistic interpretability, each aiming to bridge the gap between model predictions and real-world causality or principles. 1. **Incorporating Domain Knowledge:** - **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):** These incorporate physical laws into the architecture of neural networks, ensuring that predictions not only fit the data but also adhere to known physical principles. A foundational work in this space is Raissi et al., 2019, \\"Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Solving Forward and Inverse Problems Involving Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations,\\" published in the Journal of Computational Physics. - **Knowledge-Infused Learning:** This approach integrates domain-specific knowledge into the learning process, guiding the model to adhere to established theories or constraints. A relevant reference here is \\"Knowledge Infusion Learning: Towards Human-like Artificial Intelligence,” by Shoaib Jameel, in the IEEE Intelligent Systems, which discusses how integrating explicit knowledge can improve AI systems' understanding and reasoning capabilities. 2. **Causal Inference:** - Causal inference models aim to uncover the cause-effect relationships within data, offering a more mechanistic view of the phenomena being modeled. One pivotal work in this area is Judea Pearl's book, \\"Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference,\\" which lays the foundations for using graphical models to understand causality. - Another approach within causal inference is the use of do-calculus and causal diagrams to articulate and test causal hypotheses. Pearl et al.'s work, particularly the 2016 paper \\"Causal Inference in Statistics: An Overview\\" provides a comprehensive guide. 3. **Hybrid Models:** - Combining machine learning models with mechanistic models (e.g., differential equations models in biomedicine or environmental science) can yield predictions that are both accurate and interpretable on a mechanistic level. Karpatne et al.'s work on \\"Theory-Guided Data Science\\" provides an excellent framework for such approaches, advocating for a synergy between data-driven models and theory-based models. 4. **Feature Engineering and Selection:** - Designing features based on domain knowledge can help align model inputs with known causative factors, improving mechanistic interpretability. Techniques for feature selection that prioritize causative over merely correlative features further strengthen this alignment. A resourceful read on this subject is \\"Feature Engineering for Machine Learning\\" by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari, which emphasizes the importance of domain knowledge in crafting features that aid model interpretability. 5. **Explainable AI (XAI) Techniques:** - While not all XAI techniques enhance mechanistic understanding, some, like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), can be used to dissect model predictions in a way that highlights causal or mechanistic relationships. A foundational paper for SHAP is Lundberg and Lee's \\"A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions,\\" which illustrates how SHAP values can be used to interpret complex models' outputs.

When appropriate, reference the job of a police officer; Strategies for building mental toughness and resilience","output":"Title: Beyond the Badge: Building Resilience in Law Enforcement Chapter 5: Forge Your Mental Armor The life of a police officer is one that comes with its unique set of challenges. From the uncertainty that each day brings to dealing with difficult and sometimes dangerous situations, officers are required to perform their duties with professionalism and composure. It's a job that not only demands physical strength but, more importantly, mental toughness and resilience. In this chapter, we explore strategies that can help build the mental resilience necessary for law enforcement officers to succeed and thrive both on and off duty. **Embrace a Growth Mindset** The first step in building resilience is adopting a mindset geared towards growth and learning. Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., in her pioneering book \\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,\\" distinguishes between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. A fixed mindset assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we can't change in any meaningful way. In contrast, a growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. For police officers, adopting a growth mindset means seeing every experience, especially the challenging ones, as an opportunity to learn and improve. When faced with setbacks, instead of indulging in self-doubt, an officer with a growth mindset will analyze the situation, identify what went wrong, and devise a plan to avoid similar issues in the future. **Build Emotional Resilience** Emotional resilience is the ability to adapt to stressful situations or crises. It's about bouncing back from difficult experiences and not letting them define you. Dr. George Bonanno's studies in the field of trauma psychology suggest that people inherently have a remarkable ability to bounce back after tragedy or hardship. For police officers, building emotional resilience can mean developing coping strategies that allow them to deal with the emotional aftermath of stressful or traumatic incidents they might face. Strategies to enhance emotional resilience include maintaining a supportive social network, engaging in regular physical activity, and practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Additionally, developing hobbies or interests outside of law enforcement can provide necessary mental breaks and diversions from the daily stresses of the job. **Cultivate a Support System** The importance of a robust support system cannot be overstated for law enforcement officers. This system should ideally consist of colleagues, friends, and family members who understand the unique pressures of police work. Having people to talk to, who can listen and offer advice or simply a sympathetic ear, is crucial. Peer support programs within police departments can also be invaluable. These programs provide a safe and confidential environment where officers can discuss their experiences and feelings with fellow officers who have undergone similar experiences and can offer empathy and understanding. **Prior Training and Preparation** Mental resilience is also cultivated through rigorous training and preparation. Being well-trained and prepared for various situations that might arise in the line of duty can significantly reduce stress and anxiety. Psychological preparedness is just as crucial as physical readiness. Scenario-based training, where officers are put through simulations of real-life situations, can be particularly effective in building mental toughness. This type of training not only improves decision-making skills under pressure but also boosts confidence and reduces the fear of the unknown. **Practice Self-Care** Finally, self-care is an essential component in building resilience. The demanding nature of police work can sometimes lead to neglect of one's mental and physical health. Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and mindfulness practices like meditation can help maintain a healthy body and mind. Self-care also involves recognizing when to seek professional help. There's strength in acknowledging the need for assistance, and mental health professionals can provide the support and tools necessary to cope with the complexities of the job. In conclusion, the job of a police officer is undeniably challenging, but it's also immensely rewarding. By embracing a growth mindset, building emotional resilience, cultivating a support system, prioritizing training, and practicing self-care, officers can develop the mental toughness and resilience that are essential for success and well-being in the force. As we forge our mental armor, let's remember that it's not just about protecting ourselves; it's about strengthening our ability to serve and protect our communities with honor, courage, and integrity."},{"instruction":"Use 500-1000 words to complete the next section of the book.

Law enforcement officers are trained to respond decisively to crises, to take action when seconds count. And yet, it is within these very moments of high stress that the practice of stillness – a calm, focused state of mind – becomes invaluable. Integrating stillness into the chaos is not about physical inactivity but cultivating a mental clarity and presence that enhances decision-making and performance under pressure. **Cultivating Mental Presence** The practice of stillness begins with developing a heightened state of mental presence, an awareness that allows an officer to remain cognizant of their thoughts, emotions, and surrounding environment, even amidst turmoil. This presence is what enables an officer to discern the sound of a cry for help in a cacophony of noises or notice the subtle tension in a suspect's posture that preludes an escape attempt. Techniques such as mindfulness meditation have been shown to enhance this kind of situational awareness. By regularly engaging in mindfulness exercises, officers can train their minds to focus on the present moment without distraction. This mental discipline translates directly to the field, where full awareness of the immediate situation can mean the difference between life and death. **The Power of the Pause** In the high-speed realm of police work, the idea of pausing might seem antithetical to effective action. However, the power of the pause cannot be understated. A brief, intentional pause allows an officer to assess a situation fully, to realize the difference between a perceived threat and a real one, and to choose the most appropriate course of action. Pausing is not hesitating; it is a strategic moment of stillness that facilitates clearer thinking and better decision-making. This can be particularly crucial in situations that rapidly escalate, where the natural impulse might be to match aggression with aggression. By taking a moment to pause, officers can break this cycle, momentarily stepping back to evaluate alternative strategies that could deescalate the situation. **Breath Control Techniques** Breath control is another critical facet of integrating stillness into action. In high-stress situations, the body's natural fight-or-flight response can lead to rapid, shallow breathing, which only heightens anxiety and reduces cognitive function. Training in breath control allows officers to manage their physiological responses, slowing down their heart rate and calming their mind even as they prepare to act. This controlled breathing not only quells the body's stress response but also fosters a state of mental clarity and calm. Techniques such as the 'box breathing' method, where one inhales, holds, exhales, and holds again, all for equal counts, can be quickly employed even in the midst of action to regain composure and focus. **Embodying Stillness in Communication** Integrating stillness into high-stress moments is not only about internal management but also influences how officers interact with others in these situations. A calm, composed demeanor can have a significant calming effect on civilians and suspects alike. When an officer embodies stillness, they project an aura of control and confidence that can defuse volatile situations. This stillness in communication involves listening actively, speaking calmly, and maintaining an open, non-threatening body posture. It's about being present with the people involved, giving them your full attention, and showing empathy. This approach can often lead to more cooperative behavior from those involved in the incident, facilitating a peaceful resolution. **Conclusion** For police officers, the integration of stillness into the chaos of their workday is not just a beneficial skill; it's essential for effective, compassionate law enforcement. It allows for clear-headed decision-making in high-stakes situations, supports emotional regulation in the face of adversity, and fosters a strength that is not born of action, but of the profound power of calm. As officers across the globe continue to navigate the complexities of their roles, the practice of stillness in action stands out as a beacon, guiding the way toward not only safer communities but also toward personal well-being and fulfillment in their crucial work. Through the cultivation of mental presence, the strategic use of pauses, mastery over one’s breath, and calm communication, law enforcement professionals can achieve a level of performance and service that honors their commitment to protect and serve with integrity, compassion, and courage."},{"instruction":"Use 500-1000 words to complete the next section of the book.

This chapter delves into various case studies that exemplify how law enforcement officers have successfully integrated these principles into their work, leading to outcomes that underscore the power and effectiveness of calm, composed action in the face of adversity. **Case Study 1: The Standoff Negotiation** In a suburban neighborhood, a potentially violent standoff unfolded as a distressed veteran barricaded himself in his home, threatening harm to himself and others. Detective Maria Rodriguez was on the scene, her heart racing as the potential for tragedy loomed large. Drawing upon her training in mindfulness and emotional regulation, Rodriguez took a moment to ground herself, focusing on her breath to maintain calm. As the lead negotiator, Rodriguez's voice was steady and soothing as she communicated with the distressed individual. Despite provocations and aggressive retorts, she remained composed, her tone unwaveringly calm and empathetic. This stillness in her voice and demeanor eventually mirrored back to the individual. After hours of negotiation, the veteran surrendered peacefully, no one harmed. Rodriguez's ability to maintain emotional composure under extreme stress was instrumental in preventing a possible tragedy. **Case Study 2: Rapid Assessment Under Fire** Officer Jameson found himself in the middle of a chaotic scene at a bank robbery gone wrong. With hostages inside and the robbers increasingly erratic, every second counted. Jameson's heart pounded in his chest, the situation seemingly spiraling out of control. However, Jameson had trained extensively in using stillness techniques under pressure, and he took a strategic breath to steady his thoughts and slow his racing heart. In that moment of inner calm amidst outer chaos, Officer Jameson observed a pattern in the robbers' movements and identified a critical vulnerability. By communicating this insight to his team with clarity and confidence, they executed a precision maneuver that neutralized the threat without harm to hostages. Jameson's quick, yet calm assessment and decision-making under fire saved lives that day. **Case Study 3: De-escalating a Domestic Crisis** Responding to a call about a domestic disturbance, Officer Liu arrived to find a highly volatile situation. A couple was in the midst of a fierce argument, their emotions heightened, voices raised, and a frightened child crying nearby. Remembering his training on embodying stillness in communication, Officer Liu approached with open body language, making no sudden movements, and spoke in a calm, steady voice. Despite the initial hostility directed towards him, Liu's calm presence slowly diffused the tension. He listened intently, allowing each party to express their grievances, validating their feelings without taking sides. Through his tranquil demeanor and skilled negotiation, Officer Liu de-escalated the situation, providing a moment of peace for the family to reconsider their actions before taking a step they might regret. **Case Study 4: Mindfulness in the Midst of Mayhem** During a particularly violent public protest, amidst the cacophony of shouting, and the confusion of bodies pushing and shoving, Sergeant Green found herself overwhelmed. The line between friend and foe blurred as panic began to set in. Drawing upon her mindfulness training, Green took a moment to close her eyes, focusing intently on her breath. This brief respite allowed her to regain her center, approaching the chaos with newfound clarity. With a clear mind and a calm demeanor, Sergeant Green was able to identify agitators who were escalating the violence and strategically deploy her team to isolate and remove these elements without inciting further chaos. Her ability to maintain mental clarity in the eye of the storm helped restore order and prevent what could have escalated into a severe confrontation. **Conclusion** These case studies highlight that the utilization of stillness, a seemingly counterintuitive approach in the dynamic and often violent world of law enforcement, can lead to extraordinary outcomes. Whether it's negotiating a peaceful surrender, making split-second decisions under fire, de-escalating volatile situations, or maintaining order in the face of chaos, the principles of stillness in action have proven their worth. They not only enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement professionals in performing their duties but also protect lives and preserve the peace in our communities. Transitioning from traditional, reactive methods to this more reflective, calm approach marks a progressive shift in modern policing, one that holds promise for the safety and well-being of both officers and the public they serve."},{"instruction":"Use 500-1000 words to complete the next section of the book.

Yet, historically, the culture within many police departments has prioritized physical strength and resilience, often at the expense of mental health. Recognizing the critical need for a shift towards a holistic understanding of wellness, this chapter outlines key steps law enforcement agencies can take to support the mental well-being of their officers, ultimately leading to a healthier, more effective force. **Step 1: Leadership Buy-in and Role Modeling** The journey towards creating a culture of wellness begins at the top. Agency leaders must not only endorse wellness initiatives but also actively participate in and model behavior that underscores their commitment to mental health. This means openly discussing the importance of mental wellness, sharing personal experiences with seeking mental health support, and embedding mental health practices into the daily operations of the force. When leadership leads by example, it sends a powerful message that mental health is not just a priority but a fundamental aspect of being a well-rounded officer. **Step 2: Integrating Wellness into Training and Development** Training academies are where the foundations of a police officer’s career are laid. Incorporating wellness education, including mental health awareness, stress management, communication skills, and resilience building, into the curriculum prepares recruits to manage the psychological demands of the job from day one. Continuing education on these topics should also be part of professional development for all ranks, ensuring that officers have access to evolving strategies and support resources throughout their careers. **Step 3: Providing Accessible, Confidential Support Services** Access to mental health support that is both confidential and easily accessible is crucial. Agencies should establish a range of support options to meet diverse needs, including counseling services, peer support programs, and crisis intervention teams. These services must be confidential to encourage their utilization without fear of stigma or professional repercussions. Furthermore, partnerships with external mental health professionals who specialize in law enforcement challenges can offer additional layers of support. **Step 4: Promoting Work-Life Balance** The demands of police work often extend beyond regular hours, encroaching into personal and family time and contributing to burnout and stress. Agencies can support work-life balance by offering flexible scheduling options, promoting the use of vacation and personal time, and setting clear expectations about off-duty communications. Such policies acknowledge the officer as a whole person, whose health and well-being outside of work directly impact their performance on the job. **Step 5: Building a Supportive Community** Creating a culture of wellness extends beyond the walls of the police department. Engaging families, loved ones, and the wider community in wellness initiatives reinforces the support network available to officers. Family wellness programs, community policing initiatives that emphasize positive interactions, and public education campaigns about the challenges of police work can strengthen community ties and reduce isolation. **Step 6: Regularly Measuring and Adjusting Wellness Initiatives** As with any organizational change effort, establishing metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of wellness initiatives is key. Surveys, focus groups, and other feedback mechanisms can provide insight into how well these initiatives are meeting the needs of officers. This data should be used to adjust programs accordingly, ensuring they remain relevant and effective. Celebrating successes and recognizing individuals and teams that exemplify a commitment to wellness can further embed these values within the agency's culture. **Conclusion** By embracing these steps, law enforcement agencies can move towards a culture that values mental health as much as physical fitness and tactical acumen. In doing so, they not only enhance the well-being of their officers but also improve their ability to serve and protect their communities. Creating a culture of wellness is not a one-time initiative but an ongoing commitment to the people behind the badge, ensuring they have the support they need to face the challenges of their profession with strength, resilience, and compassion. This shift requires effort, commitment, and time but the outcomes—healthier officers, stronger communities, and a more positive public perception of law enforcement—affirm the value of prioritizing mental wellness in policing."},{"instruction":"Use 500-1000 words to complete the next section of the book.

Recognizing and addressing this critical issue, many progressive police departments are now implementing robust peer support and wellness programs as an integral part of their organizational framework. These programs aim to create a supportive environment where officers feel valued and understood, fostering a sense of camaraderie and mutual support that is essential for their well-being. This chapter provides a comprehensive guide to developing these vital programs within law enforcement agencies. **Laying the Foundation for a Peer Support Program** A well-structured peer support program is characterized by its accessibility, confidentiality, and acceptance within the police culture. The foundation of such a program relies on carefully selecting officers who exhibit empathy, strong communication skills, and a genuine desire to help their colleagues. These individuals undergo specialized training that equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to offer support, guidance, and resources to fellow officers experiencing personal or professional challenges. Training for peer supporters should encompass a wide range of topics, including active listening, basic counseling techniques, understanding the signs of stress and mental health issues, and familiarity with the resources available for more severe cases. Moreover, it’s crucial that peer supporters understand the limits of their role – they are not therapists but rather a bridge to professional help when necessary. To promote the acceptance and utilization of the peer support program, agency leadership must actively advocate for its benefits and ensure that participation does not negatively impact an officer’s career. This endorsement helps to mitigate the stigma often associated with seeking support for mental health issues within the law enforcement community. **Implementing Comprehensive Wellness Programs** Beyond peer support, comprehensive wellness programs address the multifaceted aspects of an officer’s health, including physical fitness, nutrition, stress management, and mental health. Developing these programs requires a holistic approach that acknowledges the interconnection between physical and psychological well-being. Components of a successful wellness program might include: - **Physical Fitness Initiatives:** Providing access to fitness facilities, organizing fitness challenges, and offering education on healthy exercise habits encourage officers to maintain their physical health, which in turn supports their mental well-being. - **Nutrition Counseling:** Educating officers on nutrition and offering healthy eating options at work can help improve their overall health and energy levels, critical for demanding police work. - **Stress Management Workshops:** Offering workshops on techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, and breathing exercises teaches officers practical skills for managing stress in both their personal and professional lives. - **Mental Health Resources:** Making mental health resources readily available, including counseling services, stress debriefings, and workshops on mental health awareness, ensures officers have access to professional support when needed. **Building a Supportive Culture** For peer support and wellness programs to thrive, they must be part of a broader organizational culture that prioritizes officer well-being. This culture is characterized by open communication, mutual respect, and an acknowledgment of the challenges inherent to policing. Leaders within the department play a critical role in shaping this culture by demonstrating vulnerability, sharing their own experiences with stress and mental health, and actively participating in wellness initiatives. Creating spaces where officers can openly discuss their experiences, share coping strategies, and offer support to one another is essential. Whether through formal support groups, informal gatherings, or team-building activities, these interactions foster a sense of belonging and support that can be lifesaving. **Conclusion** The development and implementation of peer support and wellness programs represent a significant step forward in how law enforcement agencies address the mental health and well-being of their officers. By providing avenues for support, education, and resources, these programs not only enhance the resilience and effectiveness of individual officers but also contribute to a more compassionate, understanding, and unified law enforcement community. Officers equipped with the tools and support to manage the stresses of their profession are better prepared to serve their communities, uphold their duties, and return home safely to their families. As such, the investment in peer support and wellness programs is not just a commitment to the health of officers but a foundation for the health of the community at large. It's an essential armor against adversity, a beacon of hope in the demanding world of law enforcement."},{"instruction":"Use 500-1000 words to complete the next section of the book. When appropriate, reference the job of a police officer; How command and leadership can promote healthy stress management","output":"Title: Guiding Shields: Command and Leadership in Promoting Healthy Stress Management Chapter 10: Leading by Example In the crucible of law enforcement, stress is an omnipresent companion. The unyielding pressures of the job can take a significant toll on the physical and mental health of officers, making stress management not just a personal responsibility but a critical command imperative. Effective leadership in law enforcement extends beyond operational success; it involves cultivating an environment where healthy stress management is not only encouraged but exemplified at every level of command. This chapter explores how leadership within police departments can foster a culture that promotes positive coping mechanisms and resilience among officers. **Cultivating an Open Environment** The first step in promoting healthy stress management is breaking down the barriers of silence. For too long, the stigma associated with stress and mental health issues has deterred officers from seeking the help they need. Command staff and leadership must spearhead the shift towards an open, supportive environment where officers feel comfortable sharing their struggles without fear of judgement or professional reprisal. Leaders can foster such an environment by openly discussing their own experiences with stress and the strategies they have used to manage it. By sharing their stories, they humanize themselves, bridge the gap between ranks, and signal that it is okay to not be okay. This level of vulnerability from command can be profoundly impactful, cultivating a culture where seeking support is viewed as a strength rather than a weakness. **Implementing Regular Stress Management Training** Knowledge is power, and in the context of stress management, it can be the difference between burnout and resilience. Command leaders should ensure that stress management training is an integral part of both initial academy training and ongoing professional development programs. Such training should cover a wide range of topics, from the physiological impacts of stress to practical coping strategies and resources available within and outside the department. Bringing in experts in psychology, mindfulness, and physical wellness to conduct workshops and seminars can provide officers with a toolbox of techniques to manage stress effectively. Additionally, incorporating scenario-based training that includes stress coping mechanisms can prepare officers for the psychological dimensions of their responsibilities in the field. **Setting Policies that Encourage Work-Life Balance** One of the most direct ways command can support healthy stress management is by establishing policies that promote a balanced work-life dynamic. This involves critical examination and adjustment of work schedules, off-duty commitments, and vacation policies to ensure officers have ample opportunity to decompress and recharge. For instance, limiting mandatory overtime, encouraging the use of vacation days, and adopting flexible scheduling options can help officers maintain a healthy balance between their professional and personal lives. Command leadership should also advocate for and facilitate access to family support services, recognizing that the well-being of an officer’s family is intrinsically linked to their own mental health. **Modeling Healthy Behaviors** Leaders in law enforcement command not only lead operations but set the tone for the behaviors and attitudes of their officers. By embodying the principles of healthy stress management in their daily actions, command staff serve as living examples of how to navigate the pressures of the job. This can range from demonstrating mindfulness and meditation techniques, sharing stories of attending counseling or therapy, to simply prioritizing physical health through exercise and proper nutrition. The visibility of leaders engaging in these behaviors legitimizes them in the eyes of their officers, reinforcing the message that taking care of one’s mental and physical health is a priority for everyone, regardless of rank. **Encouraging Peer Support and Mentorship** Finally, command and leadership can strengthen the network of support within the department by encouraging peer support and mentorship programs. By assigning mentors to new recruits and fostering peer-led support groups, departments can create a support ecosystem that facilitates open dialogue and shared coping strategies. Leadership should actively participate in and advocate for these peer support initiatives, emphasizing their value not just for individual officers but for the cohesion and morale of the force as a whole. By doing so, they amplify the message that officers are not alone in their struggles and that the department is committed to their well-being. **Conclusion** Command and leadership within law enforcement play a pivotal role in promoting healthy stress management among officers. Through their actions, policies, and the culture they cultivate, leaders have the power to mitigate the impact of stress on their forces. By championing openness, providing resources and training, promoting work-life balance, modeling healthy behaviors, and encouraging peer support, they can build a resilient force capable of facing the demands of the job with strength and equanimity. Ultimately, the leadership’s commitment to prioritizing the well-being of their officers elevates the entire department, enhancing its effectiveness, morale, and the quality of service to the community."},{"instruction":"respond: Watching a show with my family, so a great end to my week of vacation.

The fabric of such an environment is woven by the hands of its leaders, who understand that the mantle of command is much more than a rank—it's a profound responsibility to serve as the guiding light for others. This chapter delves into the core strategies that law enforcement leaders can employ to foster a respectful and supportive work environment, leading by example every step of the way. **The Pillar of Respect** At the cornerstone of a thriving agency is the principle of respect, which must permeate every aspect of operations, from the precinct floor to the community streets. Respect in law enforcement is dual-faceted; it encompasses both the respect shown to officers by their leaders and the respect those officers, in turn, extend to the public. Leaders must actively demonstrate respect in their interactions, showing that it is not merely an expectation but a lived value. This means listening with the intent to understand, acknowledging the contributions and struggles of their officers, and offering constructive feedback that empowers rather than diminishes. In doing so, they set a powerful precedent for how officers are to engage with one another and with the community they serve. **Creating a Supportive Environment** A supportive work environment in law enforcement is not only about having each other’s backs in the line of duty but also in providing emotional and professional support. Leaders can cultivate such an atmosphere by fostering open communication channels where officers feel comfortable voicing their concerns and sharing their experiences without fear of retribution. Mentorship programs are a tangible way to institutionalize support, pairing experienced officers with newcomers to guide them through the complexities of the job and the emotional toll it can exact. Similarly, establishing peer support groups can offer a space for officers to discuss shared challenges and coping strategies, reinforcing that they are not alone in their struggles. Leaders themselves should participate in these initiatives, not just as overseers but as active members. By sharing their own challenges and coping strategies, they humanize themselves, bridging the gap between ranks and reinforcing the message that seeking help is both acceptable and encouraged. **Promoting Professional Development and Well-being** A respectful, supportive work environment is also one that values and invests in the growth and well-being of its officers. Leaders should encourage continued education and professional development, providing resources and opportunities for officers to advance their skills and careers. Simultaneously, they must prioritize their officers' well-being, promoting work-life balance, and ensuring access to mental health resources. Leaders can lead by example by pursuing their own professional development and openly discussing the importance of mental health, self-care, and work-life balance. By doing so, they not only enhance their effectiveness but also normalize these crucial aspects of personal and professional life in the eyes of their officers. **Building Trust Through Transparency and Integrity** Trust is the linchpin of a respectful, supportive work environment, and it is earned through consistent actions, transparency, and integrity. Leaders in law enforcement must make decisions based not only on the letter of the law but on the principles of fairness and justice. They must be transparent about the rationale behind their decisions, especially in matters that significantly affect their officers. Moreover, admitting mistakes and taking accountability is a powerful way to demonstrate integrity. When leaders own their errors and take corrective action, they send a clear message that accountability applies to everyone, regardless of rank. This fosters a culture of trust and mutual respect, where officers feel valued and empowered to perform their duties to the best of their abilities. **Conclusion** Fostering a respectful, supportive work environment is an ongoing journey, one that requires constant effort, reflection, and adaptation from law enforcement leaders. By leading by example—demonstrating respect, providing support, promoting growth and well-being, and building trust through transparency and integrity—leaders can cultivate a culture that not only uplifts its officers but also enhances their ability to serve and protect with honor and compassion. In this endeavor, every gesture, every decision, and every interaction matters. It is through the accumulation of these daily acts of leadership that a truly respectful and supportive work environment is built—one that stands resilient in the face of challenges and steadfast in its commitment to justice and community service."},{"instruction":"Use 500-1000 words to complete the next section of the book.

As we peer into the future, we imagine a law enforcement culture where mental health is not only actively promoted but is also regarded as inseparable from an officer’s readiness and competence. This chapter outlines a vision for such a future, highlighting the transformative shifts required and the potential impacts on officers, agencies, and communities alike. **A Culture Shift: Mental Wellness as a Priority** The cornerstone of this envisioned future is a culture shift within law enforcement agencies that positions mental wellness as a critical component of officer readiness. In this culture, mental health initiatives are not add-ons or afterthoughts but are embedded in the very ethos of the department. From recruitment and training to retirement, mental wellness is prioritized, creating an environment where officers are as diligent about their mental health as they are about their physical fitness and tactical skills. This cultural shift is championed by leadership at all levels, who not only advocate for mental wellness initiatives but also actively participate in them, setting a powerful example for all officers. Mental wellness becomes a shared value, a communal responsibility that every member of the department embraces and supports. **Innovative Training and Support Systems** In the future of law enforcement, training programs are reimagined to include comprehensive mental health education, equipping officers with the tools they need to manage stress, recognize signs of mental health crises in themselves and others, and navigate the complex emotional landscapes of their jobs. These training programs are evidence-based, continuously updated, and mandatory for all, ensuring that mental wellness education is not just a one-time event but a career-long commitment. Peer support programs are expanded and strengthened, offering officers a robust network of support within their departments. These programs are complemented by partnerships with mental health professionals who specialize in law enforcement challenges, providing a bridge to external support when needed. **Integrated Wellness Policies and Practices** In this future vision, department policies and practices reflect a deep commitment to mental wellness. Shift schedules, workload management, and incident debriefings are all designed with mental health in mind, ensuring that officers have the time and space they need to recover from the stresses of their work. Departments also offer a wide range of mental health resources, from in-house counseling services to apps and online platforms that offer mental health tools and information. Access to these resources is straightforward and stigma-free, with confidentiality rigorously protected. **A Renewed Relationship with the Community** As law enforcement agencies embrace mental wellness, their relationship with the communities they serve also transforms. Officers equipped with a deeper understanding of mental health are better able to respond to incidents involving mental health crises, leading to safer, more compassionate outcomes. The community sees these efforts, recognizing the commitment of their law enforcement officers to not only manage their mental health but also to serve with empathy and understanding. Trust is rebuilt, and a sense of mutual respect and cooperation starts to define the interactions between officers and the communities they protect. **Measuring Impact and Sustaining Progress** This envisioned future is not without its challenges, but law enforcement agencies are committed to measuring the impact of their mental wellness initiatives and using the data to drive continuous improvement. Success is measured not just in reduced stress levels among officers but also in enhanced job satisfaction, decreased turnover, and positive community interactions. Sustaining progress requires ongoing investment, innovation, and commitment at every level of the department. It requires a willingness to learn, adapt, and grow, always with the goal of supporting the mental wellness of officers and enhancing their ability to serve and protect. **Conclusion** Envisioning a future where law enforcement fully embraces mental wellness offers a beacon of hope in a demanding profession. It provides a path forward that values the mental and emotional well-being of officers as much as their physical safety. This future is not only possible; it is essential. As departments across the globe begin to chart this course, they lay the foundation for a new era of law enforcement—one marked by resilience, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to the mental health of those who serve and protect."},{"instruction":"Use 500-1000 words to complete the next section of the book.

Yet, as we navigate through the tempest of societal expectations and personal challenges, the cultivation of inner stillness emerges not merely as a refuge but as a vital tool for resilience and effectiveness. This chapter explores the personal commitment of individual officers in fostering this quiet strength and outlines a path for integrating stillness into the tapestry of law enforcement work. **Understanding Stillness** Stillness, in the context of law enforcement, transcends the absence of motion. It represents a state of mental clarity, emotional stability, and deliberate, mindful action amidst chaos. For an officer, it manifests as the ability to face high-pressure situations with composure, make judicious decisions under duress, and maintain a harmonious balance between professional responsibilities and personal well-being. **The Journey Begins Within** The journey toward cultivating stillness begins with self-awareness. Officers must embark on a reflective path, recognizing their stress triggers, emotional responses, and coping mechanisms. This introspective process requires honesty and vulnerability, acknowledging one’s limitations and the imperfections inherent in the human condition. Mindfulness meditation emerges as a powerful tool in this journey, enabling officers to anchor themselves in the present, observe their thoughts without judgment, and foster a state of calm awareness. Regular practice strengthens the mind's focus, equips officers to better manage stress, and instills a sense of peace amidst turmoil. **Cultivating Emotional Resilience** Emotional resilience, the capacity to navigate through adversity without being overwhelmed, is a cornerstone of stillness. For officers, developing this resilience involves embracing a growth mindset, viewing challenges as opportunities for learning and personal growth. It necessitates a proactive approach to mental health, seeking support when needed, and employing coping strategies such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or engaging in physical activity to diffuse stress. **Integrating Stillness into Daily Duties** The ethos of stillness can permeate every facet of an officer's duties, transforming how they interact with the community, colleagues, and themselves. In the crucible of conflict, an officer grounded in stillness can de-escalate tensions, approach situations with empathy and understanding, and serve as a calming force for others. Officers can also promote stillness through their interactions with colleagues, offering support, lending an empathetic ear, and fostering an environment where open discussions about stress and mental health are not just accepted but encouraged. Mentorship roles provide a unique opportunity to instill the principles of stillness in the next generation of officers, highlighting its importance not just for personal well-being but as a critical aspect of professional excellence. **The Ripple Effect** The personal commitment of individual officers to cultivate and promote stillness has the potential to create a ripple effect, influencing departmental culture and the broader law enforcement community. As officers embody the principles of stillness, they inspire others to embark on their journey, gradually fostering a culture where mental wellness, reflection, and mindful action are valued and nurtured. **Challenges and Sustaining Progress** Institutionalizing stillness within law enforcement is not without its challenges. Obstacles such as cultural stigma around mental health, the relentless pace of policing demands, and external societal pressures can impede progress. Overcoming these challenges requires perseverance, support from leadership, and a collective effort to shift perceptions and practices within the field. Sustaining progress in cultivating stillness demands ongoing commitment, reflection, and adaptation. Officers must continually seek out resources, engage in self-care practices, and reinforce the importance of mental wellness within their circles of influence. Departments can support these efforts by providing access to training, resources, and platforms that facilitate discussions around stillness and mental health. **Conclusion** The role of the individual officer in promoting stillness is pivotal, not just for their well-being but for the resilience and effectiveness of the law enforcement profession at large. By committing to this path, officers not only enhance their capacity to serve and protect but also contribute to a cultural transformation within law enforcement—a shift toward a future where stillness is recognized as a source of strength, wisdom, and inner peace. In embracing this quiet strength, officers pave the way for a more compassionate, mindful, and resilient law enforcement community."},{"instruction":"Use 500-1000 words to complete the next section of the book.

The badge each officer wears symbolizes not only the duty to protect and serve but also the inherent challenges, pressures, and stresses that come with this noble calling. Embracing the journey of managing and mastering these stressors is crucial for the well-being of the officers and the health of the communities they pledge to keep safe. **An Ever-evolving Landscape** Law enforcement officers operate in an ever-evolving landscape where unpredictability is the only constant. The nature of this work ensures that stress, in its many forms, is an ever-present companion. From the high-stakes demands of critical incidents to the cumulative weight of daily responsibilities, the specter of stress looms large. However, within this enduring challenge lies the opportunity for growth, resilience, and a deeper understanding of oneself and the profound impact one can have on others. **The Personal Commitment to Wellness** The personal commitment to wellness, both mental and physical, is a linchpin in the quest to master stress. This commitment demands a mindful acknowledgment of the challenges faced and the proactive pursuit of strategies, tools, and practices that foster resilience. It is a commitment that requires courage—the courage to confront one's vulnerabilities, to seek help when needed, and to prioritize self-care amidst the relentless demands of the job. Officers who embark on this journey of self-care not only fortify their well-being but also model the importance of wellness for their peers, their families, and their communities. **The Role of Leadership in Cultivating Resilience** Leadership plays a pivotal role in shaping the culture within law enforcement, one where the pursuit of wellness and the mastering of stress are valued and encouraged. Commanding officers and department leaders are tasked with creating an environment where officers feel supported in their wellness journey—an environment where seeking help is viewed as a strength and where resources for stress management are readily accessible. By leading with empathy, understanding, and transparency, leaders can dismantle the stigmas associated with stress and mental health, paving the way for a more resilient and effective force. **Building a Supportive Community** The journey of mastering stress extends beyond the individual officer and the confines of the police department. It encompasses the wider community, including families, support networks, and the society at large. Fostering a supportive community where the challenges of law enforcement work are recognized, and the efforts towards wellness are supported, is essential. Such a community provides a robust foundation of support, understanding, and appreciation for officers, enabling them to navigate the stresses of their profession with confidence and resilience. **A Continuous, Collective Journey** Ultimately, the journey of mastering stress in law enforcement is a continuous, collective endeavor. It is a path marked by challenges and triumphs, setbacks, and advances. As the field of law enforcement evolves, so too must the strategies and approaches to managing stress. This requires ongoing education, dialogue, and innovation, ensuring that as new stresses emerge, new solutions are sought. It calls for a shared commitment—among officers, leadership, and the community—to support one another in this journey, recognizing that the well-being of those who protect and serve is integral to the well-being of the society they guard. **Closing Reflection** As we reflect on the journey of mastering stress within law enforcement, it becomes clear that it is more than just a professional imperative; it is a deeply personal, human pursuit. It is about nurturing the mental, emotional, and physical well-being of those who stand on the front lines, ensuring that in their charge to protect and serve, they are not lost to the very challenges they face. In fostering resilience, prioritizing wellness, and building a culture of support, the field of law enforcement can continue to evolve, not just as a profession but as a community of steadfast guardians, resilient in the face of stress and unwavering in their commitment to the safety and well-being of all.

Standard trim sizes for books can vary widely, with common sizes including 5\\"x8\\", 5.5\\"x8.5\\", and 6\\"x9\\" for novels, while non-fiction and academic books may opt for larger sizes. For a manuscript that's 92 pages on standard 8 1/2\\" by 11\\" paper, and assuming a move to a smaller, more common book size like 6\\"x9\\", with a typical typesetting layout (including a standard font like Times New Roman or Garamond, a font size around 10 to 12 points, and standard margins), you can expect the page count to increase when formatted for book printing. A rough estimate, without considering additional elements, would be that each page of your 8 1/2\\" by 11\\" manuscript might equate to approximately 1.5 to 2 pages in a 6\\"x9\\" book format. This is a very rough average and can change based on the specific choices made in typesetting. Using this estimate: - If each original manuscript page equals approximately 1.5 book pages, the 92-page manuscript could be around 138 book pages. - If each original manuscript page translates to roughly 2 book pages, the manuscript might extend to about 184 book pages. These estimations are general and can vary significantly in real publishing contexts. To get a precise page count, you would need to decide on the specifics of your book's design and lay it out accordingly, or consult with a professional book designer or publisher."},{"instruction":"give me 10 guided imagerty themes for children that they can use for distraction, dreaming, emotional regulation","output":"1. **Magical Garden Adventure** - Guide the child through imagining themselves in a vibrant, magical garden filled with flowers that sing, friendly talking animals, and a clear, sparkling stream.

Close your eyes gently and take a deep breath in... and let it out slowly. Feel yourself becoming more relaxed with each breath. Now, imagine you’re walking through a lush, green meadow filled with the most beautiful flowers you’ve ever seen. The sun is shining warmly on your face, and a gentle breeze is blowing, carrying with it the sweet scent of the flowers. You feel peaceful and happy here. As you walk, you notice something incredible in the distance – a rainbow! But this isn’t just any rainbow. It’s glowing more brightly than any you’ve ever seen, shining with vibrant colors that seem to invite you closer. Feeling curious, you walk toward the rainbow, noticing how the grass feels soft under your feet. As you get closer, you see that the rainbow is touching the ground right in front of you. But there's something even more amazing: part of the rainbow has transformed into a giant slide! It’s glistening in the sunlight, with all the colors of the rainbow swirling together. You can't help but feel excited as you approach the rainbow slide. You take a deep breath, feeling the magic in the air, and then you step onto the slide. Ready for an adventure, you sit down, take another deep breath, and then… whoosh! You're sliding down the rainbow slide! As you slide, you feel the rush of the wind in your hair and the gentle mist of the rainbow colors touching your skin. The colors are so bright and vivid, wrapping around you like a cozy blanket made of light. You slide through shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, feeling each color's warmth and joy. Then, the slide gently carries you into a world above the clouds. You land softly on a fluffy, white cloud that feels like the softest pillow. Here, in this world above the sky, everything is peaceful and calm. You can jump from cloud to cloud, feeling as light as a feather. Each cloud you touch feels soft and bouncy, making you laugh with joy. You see other children here, too, sliding down their own rainbow slides, landing on clouds, and playing games. Everyone is smiling and laughing, enjoying this magical place where happiness fills the air like sunshine. After a while, you find a cloud that’s shaped like a giant slide. You decide to go down this cloud slide, and as you do, you slide through a mist that tickles your nose and makes you giggle. At the bottom of the cloud slide, you land gently back on the soft, green meadow where your journey began. You stand up and look around, feeling refreshed and filled with joy. The rainbow is still in the sky, more beautiful than ever, reminding you that you can visit the world above the clouds anytime you need happiness and peace. Now, take a deep breath in... and let it out slowly. Feel the happiness from your adventure lingering in your heart. When you’re ready, gently open your eyes, bringing back a piece of the rainbow’s joy with you.

Majoritatea oamenilor confundă calculele pentru suprafață (care sunt măsurate în metri pătrați) cu lungimea (care este măsurată în metri liniari). Metrii liniari se referă la lungime, nu la suprafață sau volum. Dacă ai o suprafață de 1600 de metri pătrați și vrei să afli câți metri liniari reprezintă, trebuie să știi lățimea zonei sau obiectului pe care îl consideri. Spre exemplu, dacă ai o rolă de material care are lățimea constantă de 1 metru, acel 1600 de metri pătrați ar reprezenta 1600 de metri liniari de material dacă materialul este desfășurat pe o singură linie dreaptă. Dar, dacă lățimea materialului este diferită, folosești formula: metri liniari = suprafață (metri pătrați) / lățimea materialului (metri) De exemplu, dacă lățimea materialului este de 2 metri, calculul ar fi: metri liniari = 1600 m² / 2 m metri liniari = 800 m E important să reții că informația despre greutatea de 1000 kg nu este direct relevantă pentru calculul metrilor liniari, decât dacă ai nevoie să calculezi densitatea materialului sau alte caracteristici asociate cu masa sau greutatea.

Sospiri tra le labbra, destini intrecciati, su panchine dimenticate, sogni disegnati. I ragazzi che si amano non hanno età né tempo, per loro ogni istante è un perfetto momento. Sfidano tempeste, abbracciando l'infinito, in un abbraccio, ogni dolore è guarito. Tra mille folle, loro soli si vedono, in un universo parallelo si perdono. Ridono, piangono, vivono l'amore vero, un sentimento puro, un viaggio senza aero. Le stelle li guidano in notti senza fine, confidano i segreti alla luce del mattine. Mano nella mano, affrontano ogni sfida, in un mondo che spesso d'amore si dimentica. I ragazzi che si amano sono poesia vivente, una melodia dolce, eternamente presente.

selected row DataGridView1","output":"To demonstrate how to update the values in \`DataGridView2\` based on the selected row in \`DataGridView1\`, I'll guide you through a simple example. In this scenario, let's assume that \`DataGridView1\` contains a list of categories, and \`DataGridView2\` will display items belonging to the selected category in \`DataGridView1\`. For the purposes of this example, let's assume the following: - \`DataGridView1\` has two columns: \`CategoryId\` and \`CategoryName\`. - \`DataGridView2\` has three columns: \`ItemId\`, \`ItemName\`, and \`CategoryId\`. Please follow these steps to implement the solution: 1. **Prepare Your Form**: - Add two \`DataGridView\` controls to your form, named \`dataGridView1\` and \`dataGridView2\`. - For simplicity, we will manually populate \`dataGridView1\` with dummy data to simulate categories. 2. **Populate \`DataGridView1\`**: Add some dummy data to \`DataGridView1\` to simulate categories. You can do this in the form's load event handler or somewhere suitable according to your application's structure. 3. **Handle Selection Change on \`DataGridView1\`**: We'll update the contents of \`DataGridView2\` based on the selection in \`DataGridView1\`. Here's how you can wire it all up: \`\`\`csharp public partial class Form1 : Form { public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); PopulateDataGridView1(); dataGridView1.SelectionChanged += dataGridView1_SelectionChanged; } private void PopulateDataGridView1() { // Simulating category data dataGridView1.Columns.Add(\\"CategoryId\\", \\"Category ID\\"); dataGridView1.Columns.Add(\\"CategoryName\\", \\"Category Name\\"); dataGridView1.Rows.Add(\\"1\\", \\"Category A\\"); dataGridView1.Rows.Add(\\"2\\", \\"Category B\\"); // Feel free to add more categories } private void dataGridView1_SelectionChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Assuming that we are fetching items based on CategoryId PopulateDataGridView2BasedOnCategory(); } private void PopulateDataGridView2BasedOnCategory() { if (dataGridView1.CurrentRow == null) return; string selectedCategoryId = dataGridView1.CurrentRow.Cells[\\"CategoryId\\"].Value.ToString(); // Clear existing rows in DataGridView2 dataGridView2.Rows.Clear(); // Ideally, you would fetch these details from a database based on the selected category ID // Here we'll just simulate this with some dummy data dataGridView2.Columns.Clear(); // Clear existing columns for demonstration purposes dataGridView2.Columns.Add(\\"ItemId\\", \\"Item ID\\"); dataGridView2.Columns.Add(\\"ItemName\\", \\"Item Name\\"); dataGridView2.Columns.Add(\\"CategoryId\\", \\"Category ID\\"); // Example items - in a real scenario, you would query these from your data source based on the category ID if (selectedCategoryId == \\"1\\") { dataGridView2.Rows.Add(\\"1\\", \\"Item 1 of Category A\\", \\"1\\"); dataGridView2.Rows.Add(\\"2\\", \\"Item 2 of Category A\\", \\"1\\"); // Add more items as needed } else if (selectedCategoryId == \\"2\\") { dataGridView2.Rows.Add(\\"3\\", \\"Item 1 of Category B\\", \\"2\\"); dataGridView2.Rows.Add(\\"4\\", \\"Item 2 of Category B\\", \\"2\\"); // Add more items as needed } // Continue for other categories... } } \`\`\` **Notes**: - This example uses hardcoded data to simulate the dynamic updating of \`DataGridView2\` based on selection in \`DataGridView1\`. In a real-world scenario, you would likely fetch the data from a back-end database or other data sources based on the selected category. - For clarity, error checking is minimal in this example. When implementing, you should add necessary null checks and error handling as needed. - Adjust the column names and IDs according to your actual data structure."},{"instruction":"blip算法是什么时候发表的","output":"截至我的知识更新日期在2023年4月，BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) 算法是在2022年首次公开提出的。其相关的研究论文通常在专业会议或者预印本平台（如arXiv）上发布。BLIP算法是一种先进的多模态人工智能模型，旨在改善机器对图像和文本信息的理解和预测能力，通过引入自举式学习机制（bootstrapping）增强语言-图像预训练模型。请注意，有关BLIP或类似技术的最新信息，建议直接查阅最新的研究论文或技术博客。"},{"instruction":"python如何创建set对象","output":"在Python中，\`set\`是一个无序且不包含重复元素的集合。创建\`set\`对象可以使用下面的几种方法： # 使用花括号 \`{}\`（推荐方法） 你可以通过将元素放在花括号中来创建一个\`set\`。例如： \`\`\`python my_set = {1, 2, 3} print(my_set) \`\`\` 需要注意的是，创建空集合不能使用空的花括号（这样创建的是一个空字典），而应该使用\`set()\`。 # 使用\`set()\`构造函数 这种方法可以从任何可迭代对象创建\`set\`。如果你想创建一个空集合，或者从一个列表、元组等可迭代对象中创建集合，可以使用\`set()\`。例如： \`\`\`python # 创建空集合 empty_set = set() # 从列表创建集合 my_set_from_list = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set_from_list) # 从字符串创建集合 my_set_from_string = set(\\"hello\\") print(my_set_from_string) \`\`\` # 字符串中的字符到集合 当从字符串创建集合时，字符串中的每个字符将成为集合中的一个元素，且集合中不会包含重复字符。 # 注意事项 - 集合中的元素必须是不可变类型，因此你不能将列表或另一个集合作为集合中的元素。 - 集合本身是可变的，你可以添加或删除集合中的元素。 - 由于集合是无序的，因此在访问时不能依赖元素的顺序。 使用这些方法，你可以根据需要在Python中创建和操作集合对象。"},{"instruction":"python两个list如何相加合并","output":"在Python中，有几种方法可以合并两个列表（list）。下面介绍两个最常见的方法： # 使用 \`+\` 运算符 最直接的方法是使用 \`+\` 运算符将两个列表相加，这会返回两个列表的内容合并后的新列表。 \`\`\`python list1 = [1, 2, 3] list2 = [4, 5, 6] combined_list = list1 + list2 print(combined_list) # 输出: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \`\`\` 这种方法简单直观，适合于只需要偶尔进行列表合并的情况。 # 使用 \`extend()\` 方法 如果你想要在原地修改列表（即直接在第一个列表的基础上添加第二个列表的内容），可以使用\`extend()\`方法。这不会创建一个新列表，而是直接修改第一个列表。 \`\`\`python list1 = [1, 2, 3] list2 = [4, 5, 6] list1.extend(list2) print(list1) # 输出: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \`\`\` 这种方法更适用于需要在原有列表基础上添加元素的场景。 # 注意 虽然使用 \`+\` 运算符和 \`extend()\` 都可以合并列表，但它们的效率有所不同。使用 \`+\` 运算符会创建一个新列表并返回，这意味着如果合并的列表很大或者需要频繁合并列表，可能会影响程序性能。相比之下，\`extend()\`直接在原列表的基础上添加元素，通常性能更好。 选择哪种方法取决于你的具体需求——是否需要创建一个新列表，以及对性能的考虑。"},{"instruction":"python中的zip用法","output":"在Python中，\`zip()\`函数是一个内置函数，用于将可迭代的对象作为参数，将对象中对应的元素打包成一个个元组，然后返回由这些元组组成的列表（在Python 3中返回的是一个迭代器）。\`zip()\`函数可以处理任意数量的迭代器，但返回列表的长度由最短的输入迭代器决定。 # 基本用法 假设有两个列表，你想将它们对应位置的元素配对： \`\`\`python list1 = [1, 2, 3] list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c'] zipped = zip(list1, list2) print(list(zipped)) # 输出: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')] \`\`\` 在这个例子中，\`zip()\`函数将\`list1\`和\`list2\`的对应元素打包成一个元组，并返回一个迭代器。将这个迭代器转换成列表以查看其内容。 # 处理不等长的迭代器 如果迭代器的长度不相同，\`zip()\`函数会停止在最短的迭代器耗尽时： \`\`\`python list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4] list2 = ['a', 'b'] zipped = zip(list1, list2) print(list(zipped)) # 输出: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')] \`\`\` # 解压 \`zip()\`函数也可以用来解压（也就是解包）一个列表中的元素。这可以通过使用\`*\`运算符实现： \`\`\`python pairs = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')] numbers, letters = zip(*pairs) print(list(numbers)) # 输出: [1, 2, 3] print(list(letters)) # 输出: ['a', 'b', 'c'] \`\`\` 在这个例子中，\`*pairs\`表示“解包”，将\`pairs\`中的元素作为单独的参数传递给\`zip()\`函数。然后，\`zip()\`函数将这些元组的第一项组合成一个元组，第二项组合成另一个元组。 # 使用场景 \`zip()\`函数的使用场景非常广泛，比如： - 同时遍历多个序列。 - 将两个列表转换成一个字典。 - 解压序列。 \`zip()\`因其简洁和灵活性而在数据处理和迭代中非常实用。 # 注意事项 - 在Python 3中，\`zip()\`返回的是一个迭代器，而非列表。这是为了提高内存效率（因为迭代器不会像列表那样立即分配内存存储所有元素）。要查看\`zip()\`返回的内容，可以用\`list()\`或\`tuple()\`函数将其转换成列表或元组。 - 如果你处理的迭代器非常大，而且你仅仅需要一次性迭代访问它们，那么保持使用\`zip()\`返回的迭代器是更高效的遍历方式。"},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short 1970s Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the opening with the villains and the random characters that are in FROM THE FIRST PARAGRAPH SENTENCE (With funny dialogue) moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt:(but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, The Mystery Machine is always parked in the most oddest places, beginning to end.

Here's an example of how you can test a function that returns a value in a unit test: Assuming you have a function called \`myFunction()\` that you want to test: \`\`\`cpp int myFunction(){ return 42; } \`\`\` You can write a unit test for this function as follows: \`\`\`cpp #include <gtest/gtest.h> // Include the header file where myFunction is declared // #include \\"myFunction.h\\" // Test case to expect a specific return value from myFunction TEST(MyFunctionTest, ReturnValue){ int result = myFunction(); // Expect the return value of myFunction to be 42 EXPECT_EQ(result, 42); } int main(int argc, char **argv){ ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv); return RUN_ALL_TESTS(); } \`\`\` In this test case, \`EXPECT_EQ(result, 42)\` verifies that the return value of \`myFunction()\` is equal to 42. If you are expecting a boolean return value, you can use \`EXPECT_TRUE\` to check if the function returns \`true\`: \`\`\`cpp TEST(MyFunctionTest, BooleanReturnValue){ bool result = myBooleanFunction(); // Expect the return value of myBooleanFunction to be true EXPECT_TRUE(result); } \`\`\` Ensure that you include the necessary header files and set up your test environment correctly to run the unit tests. Compile your test code with GTest and run it to verify that the function returns the expected values in the unit tests."},{"instruction":"how we can integrate gcov in my UT","output":"To integrate \`gcov\` (GNU Code Coverage tool) in your unit tests using Google Test (GTest), you can follow these steps: 1. Compile your code with the \`--coverage\` flag to generate the necessary profiling information for code coverage analysis. For example, if you are using \`g++\` to compile your code, you can add the \`--coverage\` flag to enable code coverage instrumentation: \`\`\`bash g++ -o myUnitTest myUnitTest.cpp -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread --coverage \`\`\` 2. Run your unit tests to generate coverage data. Execute your unit tests as you normally would. \`\`\`bash ./myUnitTest \`\`\` 3. After running the tests, \`gcov\` will generate \`.gcda\` and \`.gcno\` files containing coverage data. These files provide information on which lines of code were executed during the tests. 4. Run \`gcov\` on your source files to generate a coverage report. \`\`\`bash gcov mySourceFile.cpp \`\`\` This command will generate a \`mySourceFile.cpp.gcov\` file containing detailed coverage information. 5. Analyze the coverage report to identify which lines of code are covered by your unit tests and which lines remain untested. By following these steps, you can integrate \`gcov\` for code coverage analysis in your unit tests with Google Test. This can help you identify areas of your codebase that may need additional testing coverage."},{"instruction":"how this can be add in my cmakelist","output":"To integrate \`gcov\` for code coverage analysis into your CMakeLists.txt file for a project that uses Google Test (GTest), you can add the necessary options to enable coverage instrumentation. Here's an example of how you can modify your CMakeLists.txt file to include \`gcov\` support: \`\`\`cmake cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10) project(MyProject) # Add Google Test library add_subdirectory(googletest) include_directories(googletest/include) # Set compiler flags for coverage analysis set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \\"--coverage\\") set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS \\"--coverage\\") # Add your test executable add_executable(MyTests test/myUnitTest.cpp) # Link with Google Test libraries target_link_libraries(MyTests gtest gtest_main pthread) # Optionally, configure the test to run with code coverage add_custom_target(coverage COMMAND ./MyTests COMMAND gcov -r mySourceFile.cpp WORKING_DIRECTORY {CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} ) \`\`\` In this CMakeLists.txt file: 1. The \`set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \\"--coverage\\")\` and \`set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS \\"--coverage\\")\` lines set the compiler and linker flags to enable code coverage instrumentation. 2. The \`add_custom_target(coverage ...)\` block adds a custom target named \\"coverage\\" that runs your unit tests and generates the code coverage report using \`gcov\`. 3. Replace \`MyTests\` with the name of your test executable and \`mySourceFile.cpp\` with the relevant source file for which you want to generate the coverage report. After adding these lines to your CMakeLists.txt file, you can run \`make coverage\` from the build directory to build and run your unit tests with coverage instrumentation. The coverage report will be generated using \`gcov\`. Remember to replace the placeholder names with the actual names of your test executable and source files.

After making these changes to your CMakeLists.txt file, you can run \`make coverage\` command from the build directory to build the executable and generate the code coverage report."},{"instruction":"What would have happened if Kids WB never became the CW4Kids","output":"If Kids WB had never transitioned into the CW4Kids, the landscape of children's programming and animation syndication in the United States would have been notably different. Kids WB was a vital programming block that aired on the Warner Bros. Television Network and was known for showcasing a mix of original shows and popular Japanese anime, significantly influencing young viewers and the popularity of certain franchises in the US. The transition to the CW4Kids in 2008 marked the end of an era and the beginning of changes in how children's programming was distributed and viewed. Here are several impacts and developments we might have seen if Kids WB had continued instead of morphing into the CW4Kids: 1. **Continued Influence of Anime**: Kids WB was instrumental in introducing and popularizing anime in the United States, with shows like \\"Pokémon\\" and \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" If it had continued, it's likely that it would have kept bringing over popular anime series, further influencing American tastes and possibly accelerating the anime boom even more than what was seen in reality. 2. **Original Programming Direction**: Kids WB was known for its unique and innovative original programming, such as \\"Animaniacs,\\" \\"Batman: The Animated Series,\\" and \\"Static Shock.\\" Without the transition, we might have seen more original, possibly groundbreaking series that could have shaped the tastes and viewing habits of a generation. 3. **Broadcast Television's Role in Kid's Content**: The transition to the CW4Kids, and later to other forms like the Vortexx, reflected broader industry shifts towards cable and streaming platforms for children's content distribution. If Kids WB had remained a significant player, broadcast television might have retained a larger share of the children's programming market for a longer time, delaying the pivot to streaming and cable. 4. **Competition and Market Diversity**: The presence of a strong, competitive programming block like Kids WB would have meant continued fierce competition among networks and channels for children's viewership. This could have led to more diversity in programming options and perhaps a different approach by other networks in terms of content acquisition and development, including a stronger emphasis on quality and innovation to compete. 5. **Branding and Franchise Development**: Kids WB was effective at brand-building and franchise development for Warner Bros. Without transitioning away from it, Warner Bros. may have had a more direct outlet for promoting and leveraging their franchises among younger audiences, impacting how properties like DC Comics characters were marketed and evolved in terms of media presence. Ultimately, the continuity of Kids WB without becoming the CW4Kids would have had broad implications not just for the content available to viewers but also for the strategies of content creators, the television market's evolution, and the cultural integration of various forms of animation and storytelling in the US."},{"instruction":"What would have became of World of Quest (which was pulled weeks after KWB changed its name), and what would have happened to 4Kids's new GoGoRiki (which debuted at the end of the transitional period), and would Kids WB have taken BTBATB, TLTS, TTG and SDMI?","output":"Given the hypothetical scenario where Kids WB never transitioned into the CW4Kids, we can speculate on several potential outcomes for the mentioned shows and their place within the Kids WB lineup based on the network's past behaviors and strategic content positioning. # World of Quest \\"World of Quest\\" was an animated series based on the graphic novel series by Jason T. Kruse. Its pull from the schedule weeks after the transformation from Kids WB to the CW4Kids could imply that under Kids WB's original branding and management, the show might have had a different fate. Kids WB had a reputation for supporting a diverse array of animated content, including adventurous, action-oriented series that appealed to a broad audience. If Kids WB had continued, it's conceivable that \\"World of Quest\\" would have been given more time to find its audience or at least complete its initial run more smoothly. Its continuation would have depended on factors like viewer reception, merchandise sales (if applicable), and overall fit within the network's strategic vision. # GoGoRiki (Kikoriki) \\"GoGoRiki,\\" known internationally as \\"Kikoriki,\\" was quite different in tone and style from the typical action-adventure or superhero-themed programming that Kids WB was known for. Its debut at the end of the transitional period to CW4Kids marked a shift towards more diverse offerings. If Kids WB had continued as the primary brand, it's uncertain if \\"GoGoRiki\\" would have found a long-term slot within its programming lineup, given its distinct style and narrative approach compared to other Kids WB hits. However, the network's commitment to animation and reaching a broad audience might have allowed for experimentation and inclusion of such a series, at least in a marginal time slot. # Batman: The Brave and the Bold (BTBATB) Given Kids WB's history with DC Comics characters, including the successful runs of \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" and \\"Justice League,\\" it's highly likely that \\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\\" (BTBATB) would have found a home on Kids WB. The series, with its lighter tone and homage to the Silver Age of comic books, could have been an attractive addition to the network, aligning with its tradition of showcasing animated superhero content. # The Looney Tunes Show (TLTS) The Looney Tunes have long been part of the Warner Bros. family, and \\"The Looney Tunes Show\\" (TLTS) could have been a natural fit for Kids WB, offering a modern take on the classic characters. Given the network's prior success with \\"Looney Tunes\\" related programming, TLTS could have served as both a nod to its roots and a way to engage newer audiences with timeless characters. # Teen Titans Go! (TTG) Considering the original \\"Teen Titans\\" series' success on Kids WB, \\"Teen Titans Go!\\" (TTG) might have been eagerly adopted by the network. TTG's comedic, lighter approach to the characters could have appealed to both fans of the original series and younger viewers, making it a strategic choice for the network seeking to balance legacy content with fresh takes. # Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated (SDMI) Kids WB had a history of airing various iterations of the Scooby-Doo franchise. \\"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\\" (SDMI) could have seamlessly integrated into its lineup, appealing to the network's demographic with its blend of mystery, comedy, and supernatural elements. Given the brand's enduring popularity, SDMI might have been a strong performer on the network. In summary, under the continued banner of Kids WB, these series might have benefited from the network's established brand, affinity for adventure and superhero themes, and capacity to experiment with different animation styles. The programming decisions would have ultimately hinged on strategic goals, audience reception, and the evolving television landscape, including the rising influence of digital platforms and changing viewing habits."},{"instruction":"What about shows culled in previous years (e.g Ozzy & Drix, Monster Allergy, Xiaolin Showdown)","output":"If Kids WB had continued without transitioning into the CW4Kids, the fate of shows that had been culled in previous years, such as \\"Ozzy & Drix,\\" \\"Monster Allergy,\\" and \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" could have played out differently, depending on various factors such as viewership, production costs, and strategic direction of the network. Here's a speculative look at each show within this alternate scenario: # Ozzy & Drix \\"Ozzy & Drix\\" is an animated series based on the film \\"Osmosis Jones.\\" It focuses on the adventures of a white blood cell and a cold pill as they protect the body of a teenager. Given the educational and entertainment value embedded within its premise, if Kids WB had continued, there might have been potential for revisiting or even rebooting the series, especially during a time when educational content was becoming increasingly valuable on children's programming blocks. An emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in later years could have provided a new context for \\"Ozzy & Drix\\" to be reintroduced to a new audience. # Monster Allergy \\"Monster Allergy\\" is an animated series based on the Italian comic book series of the same name. It features a young boy with allergies that give him the ability to see and battle monsters. The unique European aesthetic and storyline of \\"Monster Allergy\\" offered something different from the typically American-centric shows. Had Kids WB continued, and with a growing interest in diverse content and international animation, \\"Monster Allergy\\" might have found a renewed lease of life, particularly as platforms like Netflix began to invest in global children’s programming, proving there's an audience for such content. # Xiaolin Showdown \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" was notable for its unique blend of martial arts action, comedy, and fantasy, centered around a group of young warriors in training. This show had a successful run and a strong fan base, which could have made it a candidate for continuation or revival under the Kids WB banner, similar to how other networks have revisited classic properties to capitalize on nostalgia and introduce them to new audiences. With the later emergence of streaming platforms and the reboot culture, \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" might have seen new life either as a continuation, a reboot, or through additional related content such as movies or mini-series. # General Impact on Revived or Continued Series The continuation of Kids WB without the transition to the CW4Kids would imply a more stable and potentially creative-friendly environment for the shows that had been previously popular on the network. One potential strategy might have been the revival of select series that had built loyal fanbases or that were deemed ahead of their time, especially as digital platforms began to emerge as viable alternatives to traditional broadcast methods, offering new ways to distribute and monetize content. Moreover, the evolving media landscape, characterized by the rise of online streaming and on-demand viewing options, could have influenced Kids WB to adapt its content strategy, possibly leading to the development of digital-first content, spin-offs, or reboots of these beloved series. This strategy could have leveraged nostalgia while appealing to new generations of viewers. In conclusion, while it's speculative to imagine what could have happened to these shows under a sustained Kids WB banner, it's reasonable to assume that the evolving preferences of audiences and the changing dynamics of content distribution could have offered new opportunities for these properties to be revisited or continued in some form."},{"instruction":"здесь в result возвращается json {\\"OrderId\\":2065188,\\"ExtId\\":\\"14297RVS\\"} и передается далее в метод, как мне в этом json оставить только extId? @Override public PayResult releaseHold(PayInfo paymentInfo) { try { Hold3Ds2 holdRequest = new Hold3Ds2(); holdRequest.setAmountRub(paymentInfo.getAmount()); holdRequest.setAmount(null); holdRequest.setExtId(paymentInfo.getOrderId().toString()); RestResult result = tkbGateway.holdReversal(holdRequest,paymentInfo); if (result.getResultCode() >= BAD_REQUEST_CODE) { return error(\\"[releaseHold] Сбой сервиса TKB (releaseHold) Код ответа = \\" + result.getResultCode(), null); } LOGGER.info(\\"[releaseHold] (releaseHold) result = \\" + (result.getResult() != null ? result.getResult().replaceAll(REMOVE_NEW_LINE_PATTERN, \\" \\") : \\"\\")); if (isEmpty(result.getResult())) { return error(\\"Сбой сервиса TKB (releaseHold) пустой ответ\\", null); } // Если ордер финализировался успешно, то запишем результат в очередь для опроса статуса и сразу вернем успешный результат // В монолит он у нас не уедет createTkbStatusRequest(ACQUIRER_CALLBACK_RELEASE_HOLD, result.getResult(), paymentInfo); return PayResult.ok(null); } catch (Exception e) { return error(\\"Сбой сервиса TKB (releaseHold)\\", e); } }","output":"Для извлечения только значения ExtId из JSON, вам нужно сначала преобразовать JSON-строку в объект JSON, затем получить значение ExtId и вернуть его.

Make sure that the compile options for the target are set appropriately: \`\`\`cmake target_compile_options(opengl_cluster_sample_app PRIVATE -w -fpermissive -g --coverage) \`\`\` 3. Ensure that the coverage flags are set before the target is created: \`\`\`cmake add_executable(opengl_cluster_sample_app {SOURCES}) if(ARCH STREQUAL \\"x86_64\\") # Link the required libraries set(link_lib m EGL GLESv2 freetype pthread {GL_LIBRARY} {GLFW_LIBRARY} {GLEW_LIBRARY} {GLU_LIBRARY} {LINUX_X86_LOCAL_LIB} ) # ... endif() \`\`\` By including the \`--coverage\` flag in the compile and linking options, the \`gcov\` tool will generate code coverage reports when the application is executed. 4. After building and running your test application, you can generate the coverage report using the \`gcov\` tool on the generated object files. By following these steps, you should be able to apply code coverage analysis using \`gcov\` in your CMakeLists.txt file.

However, we can venture a guess based on the type of programming that was popular on Kids' WB in its final years, trends in children's television at the time, and shows that started airing around the changeover period. Kids' WB was well-known for its mix of animated series, including original shows, anime, and American adaptations of foreign material. In its later years, the programming block featured a variety of shows, from superhero cartoons to anime favorites. Here's a speculative look at what might have been included, blending the legacy of Kids' WB with the direction children's programming was heading at the time: 1. **Pokémon**: A staple of the Kids' WB lineup for many years, it's very likely Pokémon would have remained on the schedule, continuing with new episodes from whatever season was current in 2008. 2. **Yu-Gi-Oh!**: Another long-standing series on Kids' WB, it's possible a Yu-Gi-Oh! series would have been part of the lineup, possibly \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's,\\" which began airing in the U.S. around that time. 3. **The Spectacular Spider-Man**: This series debuted in 2008 and was well-received. It's conceivable that it would have continued to air had Kids' WB remained in operation. 4. **Batman: The Brave and the Bold**: Premiering in late 2008, this Batman series might have been a strong candidate for the Kids' WB fall lineup, given the success of previous Batman series on the block. 5. **Legion of Super Heroes**: If the series had been renewed for a third season, it could have possibly remained on the fall lineup. 6. **Scooby-Doo!**: A new iteration of Scooby-Doo, such as \\"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated,\\" which premiered in 2010, might have been pushed forward or another Scooby-Doo series could have been developed for the slot. 7. **Original programming**: Kids’ WB had a history of creating original content. It’s plausible they would have introduced one or two new animated series aimed at their demographic. 8. **Imported/Adapted Anime**: Following the trend of including popular anime, Kids' WB might have looked for the next big anime hit after Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!, possibly something like \\"Beyblade: Metal Fusion\\" which began airing in Japan in 2008, or continuing with “Blue Dragon,” which was airing during the transition period. This hypothetical lineup combines continuing popular series with new shows that began airing around the 2008/2009 television season. However, the exact details of such a lineup are speculative and ultimately depend on various factors, including production schedules, licensing agreements, and broader strategic decisions by the network."},{"instruction":"Write a lineup, running from 7am to 12pm, (Will and Dewitt still at 7am) Johnny Test is still here, and also Spider Riders and one other show is back","output":"Creating a hypothetical Kids' WB lineup for Fall 2008 with the constraints and requests provided, and assuming this lineup is for Saturday mornings, which was a traditional stronghold for Kids' WB, I'll incorporate a mix of returning favorites and shows that might have been continued or introduced based on the trends and available programming of that time. Let's assume a typical 5-hour block running from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM, with each slot being approximately 30 minutes. I'll start with \\"Will and Dewitt\\" as requested, keep \\"Johnny Test\\" in the lineup, reintroduce \\"Spider Riders,\\" and consider the inclusion of another returning or ongoing show. # Kids' WB Fall 2008 Hypothetical Lineup **7:00 AM - Will and Dewitt** Kicking off the morning with friendly faces, \\"Will and Dewitt\\" is a show about a young boy named Will and his talking frog Dewitt going on adventures and overcoming challenges, encouraging problem-solving and creativity. **7:30 AM - Skunk Fu!** This animated series focuses on a young skunk, Skunk, learning Kung Fu in order to defend his valley from the evil Dragon and his minions. This could serve as a light-hearted yet action-packed follow-up to the opener. **8:00 AM - Johnny Test** A staple of Kids' WB, \\"Johnny Test\\" follows the adventures of an 11-year-old boy, his super-genius twin sisters, and their genetically engineered talking dog. The show matches well with the block's adventurous and humorous tone. **8:30 AM - Spider Riders** Returning by popular demand, \\"Spider Riders\\" is an anime-inspired series about a boy who finds himself in the Inner World, where he and his battle spider fight the Invectids to save the inhabitants. **9:00 AM - The Spectacular Spider-Man** Continuing the action-adventure theme of the morning, this critically acclaimed series focuses on the web-slinging hero during his high school years, battling classic villains and navigating adolescent challenges. **9:30 AM - Legion of Super Heroes** In this animated series, a group of young superheroes in the 31st century recruit Superman in their fight against evil. Its inclusion maintains the superhero action theme prominent in this hypothetical block. **10:00 AM - Batman: The Brave and the Bold** Featuring the Dark Knight teaming up with other heroes from the DC Universe to face villains and solve crimes, it offers a lighter take on Batman that blends well with the adventurous tone of the lineup. **10:30 AM - Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl Series** Continuing a long tradition of Pokémon on Kids' WB, this iteration follows Ash, Dawn, and Brock in the Sinnoh region, aiming for Pokémon mastery, Pokémon contests, and more. **11:00 AM - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's** The new generation of Yu-Gi-Oh! focusing on Yusei Fudo and his friends battling with Duel Monsters in the futuristic setting of New Domino City keeps the excitement high with strategic battles and compelling storytelling. **11:30 AM - Magi-Nation** This show follows Tony Jones, an average boy from Earth who finds himself in the magical land of Magi-Nation. He and his friends battle evil Shadow Magi and their creatures while searching for a way home. It's a great way to round off the morning with fantasy and adventure. This lineup maintains a balance between action, adventure, comedy, and fantasy, appealing to a broad spectrum of viewers and fitting well with the themes and shows Kids' WB was known for."},{"instruction":"already i have a Cmakelist for the Test application How can i Integrate the gcov UT coverage","output":"To integrate gcov code coverage with your CMake project, you will need to add the necessary flags and options to your CMakeLists.txt file.

Weakness and tingling in your hands and feet are usually the first symptoms. These sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body. In its most severe form Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition must be hospitalized to receive treatment. Symptoms: Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in your feet and legs and spreading to your upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis. Signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include: • A pins and needles sensation in your fingers, toes, ankles or wrists • Weakness in your legs that spreads to your upper body • Unsteady walking or inability to walk or climb stairs • Difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing • Double vision or inability to move the eyes • Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night • Difficulty with bladder control or bowel function • Rapid heart rate • Low or high blood pressure • Difficulty breathing People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin. Risk factors: Guillain-Barre syndrome can affect all age groups, but your risk increases as you age. It's also slightly more common in males than females. Guillain-Barre syndrome may be triggered by: • Most commonly, infection with campylobacter, a type of bacteria often found in undercooked poultry • Influenza virus • Cytomegalovirus • Epstein-Barr virus • Zika virus • Hepatitis A, B, C and E • HIV, the virus that causes AIDS • Mycoplasma pneumonia • Surgery • Trauma • Hodgkin's lymphoma • Rarely, influenza vaccinations or childhood vaccinations • COVID-19 virus • COVID-19 Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccine. Complications: Guillain-Barre syndrome affects your nerves. Because nerves control your movements and body functions, people with Guillain-Barre may experience: Breathing difficulties: The weakness or paralysis can spread to the muscles that control your breathing, a potentially fatal complication. Up to 22% of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome need temporary help from a machine to breathe within the first week when they're hospitalized for treatment. Residual numbness or other sensations: Most people with Guillain-Barre syndrome recover completely or have only minor, residual weakness, numbness or tingling. Heart and blood pressure problems: Blood pressure fluctuations and irregular heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias) are common side effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Pain: One-third of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome experience severe nerve pain, which may be eased with medication. Bowel and bladder function problems: Sluggish bowel function and urine retention may result from Guillain-Barre syndrome. Blood clots: People who are immobile due to Guillain-Barre syndrome are at risk of developing blood clots. Until you're able to walk independently, taking blood thinners and wearing support stockings may be recommended. Pressure sores: Being immobile also puts you at risk of developing bedsores (pressure sores). Frequent repositioning may help avoid this problem. Relapse: A small percentage of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome have a relapse, experiencing muscle weakness even years after the symptoms ended. Local (normal) Treatment: There's no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce the severity of the illness: Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis): The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which manufactures more plasma to make up for what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves. Immunoglobulin therapy: Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein (intravenously). High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome. These treatments are equally effective. Mixing them or administering one after the other is no more effective than using either method alone. You are also likely to be given medication to: Relieve pain, which can be severe Prevent blood clots, which can develop while you're immobile People with Guillain-Barre syndrome need physical help and therapy before and during recovery. Your care may include: Movement of your arms and legs by caregivers before recovery, to help keep your muscles flexible and strong. Physical therapy during recovery to help you cope with fatigue and regain strength and proper movement. Training with adaptive devices, such as a wheelchair or braces, to give you mobility and self-care skills. Background: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) can be described as a collection of clinical syndromes that manifests as an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy with resultant weakness and diminished reflexes. With poliomyelitis under control in developed countries, GBS is now the most important cause of acute flaccid paralysis. (See Clinical Presentation.) Although the classic description of GBS is that of a demyelinating neuropathy with ascending weakness, many clinical variants have been well documented in the medical literature, and variants involving the cranial nerves or pure motor involvement and axonal injury are not uncommon. (See Pathophysiology.) Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is the most widely recognized form of GBS in Western countries, but the variants known as acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), and Miller-Fisher syndrome also are well recognized. Based on a clinical spectrum of symptoms and findings, it is widely believed that strictly defined subgroups of GBS exist. However, these subgroups are not easily distinguished. GBS remains a diagnosis made primarily through the assessment of clinical history and findings (see Clinical Presentation). Serum autoantibodies are not measured routinely in the workup of GBS, but results may be helpful in patients with a questionable diagnosis or a variant of GBS (see Workup). Approximately one third of patients require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), primarily because of respiratory failure. After medical stabilization, patients can be treated on a general medical/neurologic floor, but continued vigilance remains important in preventing respiratory, cardiovascular, and other medical complications. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange may hasten recovery. After discharge, outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy may be beneficial in helping patients with GBS to regain their baseline functional status. Historical background: In 1859, Landry published a report on 10 patients with an ascending paralysis. Subsequently, in 1916, 3 French physicians (Guillain, Barré, and Strohl) described 2 French soldiers with motor weakness, areflexia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albuminocytologic dissociation, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. The identified syndrome was later named Guillain-Barré syndrome. Historically, GBS was a single disorder; however, current practice acknowledges several variant forms. Pathophysiology: GBS is a postinfectious, immune-mediated disease. Cellular and humoral immune mechanisms probably play a role in its development. Most patients report an infectious illness in the weeks prior to the onset of GBS. Many of the identified infectious agents are thought to induce production of antibodies that cross-react with specific gangliosides and glycolipids, such as GM1 and GD1b, that are distributed throughout the myelin in the peripheral nervous system. The pathophysiologic mechanism of an antecedent illness and of GBS can be typified by Campylobacter jejuni infections. The virulence of C jejuni is thought to be based on the presence of specific antigens in its capsule that are shared with nerves. Immune responses directed against lipopolysaccharide antigens in the capsule of C jejuni result in antibodies that cross-react with ganglioside GM1 in myelin, resulting in immunologic damage to the peripheral nervous system. This process has been termed molecular mimicry. Pathologic findings in GBS include lymphocytic infiltration of spinal roots and peripheral nerves (cranial nerves may be involved as well), followed by macrophage-mediated, multifocal stripping of myelin. This phenomenon results in defects in the propagation of electrical nerve impulses, with eventual absence or profound delay in conduction, causing flaccid paralysis. Recovery is typically associated with remyelination. In some patients with severe disease, a secondary consequence of the severe inflammation is axonal disruption and loss. A subgroup of patients may have a primary immune attack directly against nerve axons, with sparing of myelin. The clinical presentation in these patients is similar to that of the principal type. Subtypes of Guillain-Barré syndrome: Several variants of GBS are recognized. These disorders share similar patterns of evolution, symptom overlap, and probable immune-mediated pathogenesis. Recovery from them varies. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy The acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) subtype is the most commonly identified form in the United States. It is generally preceded by a bacterial or viral infection. Nearly 40% of patients with AIDP are seropositive for C jejuni. Lymphocytic infiltration and macrophage-mediated peripheral nerve demyelination is present. Symptoms generally resolve with remyelination. Acute motor axonal neuropathy The acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) subtype is a purely motor disorder that is more prevalent in pediatric age groups.] AMAN is generally characterized by rapidly progressive symmetrical weakness and ensuing respiratory failure. Nearly 70-75% of patients with AMAN are seropositive for Campylobacter, with the majority of cases of AMAN being associated with preceding C jejuni diarrhea. Patients typically have high titers of antibodies to gangliosides (ie, GM1, GD1a, GD1b). Inflammation of the spinal anterior roots may lead to disruption of the blood-CNS barrier. Biopsies show wallerianlike degeneration without significant lymphocytic inflammation. Many cases have been reported in rural areas of China, especially in children and young adults during the summer months. Pure axonal cases may occur more frequently outside of Europe and North America. AMAN cases may also be different from cases of axonal GBS described in the West. Prognosis is often quite favorable. Although recovery for many is rapid, severely disabled patients with AMAN may show improvement over a period of years. One third of patients with AMAN may actually be hyperreflexic. Although the mechanism for this hyperreflexia is unclear, dysfunction of the inhibitory system via spinal interneurons may increase motor neuron excitability. Hyperreflexia is significantly associated with the presence of anti-GM1 antibodies. Acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy Acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) is a severe acute illness differing from AMAN in that it also affects sensory nerves and roots. [17] Patients are typically adults. AMSAN often presents as rapid and severe motor and sensory dysfunction. Marked muscle wasting is characteristic, and recovery is poorer than it is from electrophysiologically similar cases of AMAN. As with AMAN, AMSAN is often associated with preceding C jejuni diarrhea. Pathologic findings show severe axonal degeneration of motor and sensory nerve fibers with little demyelination. Miller-Fisher syndrome Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), which is observed in about 5% of all cases of GBS, classically presents as a triad of ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia. Acute onset of external ophthalmoplegia is a cardinal feature. Ataxia tends to be out of proportion to the degree of sensory loss. Patients may also have mild limb weakness, ptosis, facial palsy, or bulbar palsy. Patients have reduced or absent sensory nerve action potentials and absent tibial H reflex. Anti-GQ1b antibodies are prominent in MFS, and have a relatively high specificity and sensitivity for the disease.Dense concentrations of GQ1b ganglioside are found in the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which may explain the relationship between anti-GQ1b antibodies and ophthalmoplegia. Patients with acute oropharyngeal palsy carry anti-GQ1b/GT1a IgG antibodies.Recovery generally occurs within 1-3 months. Acute panautonomic neuropathy Acute panautonomic neuropathy, the rarest GBS variant, involves the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Patients have severe postural hypotension, bowel and bladder retention, anhidrosis, decreased salivation and lacrimation, and pupillary abnormalities. Cardiovascular involvement is common, and dysrhythmias are a significant source of mortality. Significant motor or sensory involvement is lacking. Recovery is gradual and often incomplete. Pure sensory GBS A pure sensory variant of GBS has been described in the literature. It is typified by a rapid onset of sensory loss, sensory ataxia, and areflexia in a symmetrical and widespread pattern. Lumbar puncture studies show albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF, and results from electromyography (EMG) show characteristic signs of a demyelinating process in the peripheral nerves. The prognosis in pure GBS is generally good. Immunotherapies, such as plasma exchange and the administration of IVIGs, can be tried in patients with severe disease or slow recovery. Other variants The pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant of GBS is distinguished by isolated facial, oropharyngeal, cervical, and upper limb weakness without lower limb involvement. There can be combinations of any of the above subtypes, and virtually any combination of nerve injury. There are likely mild cases that cause temporary symptoms, improve spontaneously, and never get definitively diagnosed. Other unusual clinical variants with restricted patterns of weakness are observed only in rare cases. Etiology: GBS is considered to be a postinfectious, immune-mediated disease targeting peripheral nerves. Up to two thirds of patients report an antecedent bacterial or viral illness prior to the onset of neurologic symptoms.Respiratory infections are most frequently reported, followed by gastrointestinal infections. Administration of certain vaccinations and other systemic illnesses have also been associated with GBS. Case reports exist regarding numerous medications and procedures; however, whether any causal link exists is unclear. C jejuni: In several studies, C jejuni was the most commonly isolated pathogen in GBS. Serology studies in a Dutch GBS trial identified 32% of patients as having had a recent C jejuni infection, while studies in northern China documented infection rates as high as 60%. Gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract symptoms can be observed with C jejuni infections. C jejuni infections can also have a subclinical course, resulting in patients with no reported infectious symptoms prior to the development of GBS. Patients who develop GBS following an antecedent C jejuni infection often have a more severe course, with rapid progression and a prolonged, incomplete recovery. A strong clinical association has been noted between C jejuni infections and the pure motor and axonal forms of GBS. The virulence of C jejuni is thought to result from the presence of specific antigens in its capsule that are shared with nerves. Immune responses directed against capsular lipopolysaccharides produce antibodies that cross-react with myelin to cause demyelination. C jejuni infections also generate anti-ganglioside antibodies—including to the gangliosides GM1, GD1a, GalNac-GD1a, and GD1b—that are commonly found in patients with AMAN and AMSAN, the axonal subtypes of GBS. (Patients with C. jejuni enteritis not complicated by GBS, however, do not produce the specific anti-ganglioside antibodies.) Even in the subgroup of patients with GM1 antibodies, however, the clinical manifestations vary. Host susceptibility is probably one determinant in the development of GBS after infectious illness. Although GM1 antibodies can also be found in patients with demyelinating GBS, they are much less common in these cases. C. jejuni infection can also generate antibodies to the ganglioside GQ1b, a component of oculomotor nerve myelin; these are associated with MFS. COVID-19: Evidence exists that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is linked to the development of neurologic complications, including GBS. By April 20, 2020, one case of GBS in a patient with COVID-19 had been reported out of China and five such cases had been reported out of Italy. A report on the Italian cases said that GBS developed 5-10 days after COVID-19 had been diagnosed, with three of the patients having the demyelinating form of GBS, and the other two appearing to have an axonal variant. In June 2020, the first US case report of a patient with GBS associated with COVID-19 was published. The syndrome developed soon after the individual became infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, with test results indicating that he had the demyelinating form of GBS. Epidemiology: GBS is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.81–1.89 (median 1.11) per 100,000 person–years, and is more common in men than in women (ratio 3:2).1,16 Worldwide, the incidence is variable; for example, a low rate of 0.40 per 100,000 person–years was reported in Brazil, in contrast to a high rate of 2.5 per 100,000 person–years in Curaçao and Bangladesh.16–20 GBS seems to occur less frequently in children (0.34–1.34 per 100,000 person-years) than in adults, 18 and its incidence increases with age 16.18. Figure 1 | The course of GBS. The majority of patients with GBS report an infection before the onset of weakness. Antiganglioside antibodies are often detected; their levels decrease over time. Different types of antibodies are related to the preceding infection and the GBS subtype. Progressive weakness reaches its maximum within 4 weeks (often within 2 weeks). The recovery phase may last many weeks, months or even years. Abbreviation: GBS, Guillain–Barré syndrome. Reprinted from Lancet Neurology 7, van Doorn, P. A., Ruts, L. & Jacobs, B. C.

The background incidence of GBS in most studies remains constant over time, although seasonal fluctuations have occasionally been found in studies from Curaçao, Bangladesh and China. The proportions of patients with GBS who have AIDP and AMAN vary greatly around the world. AIDP is the predominant subtype (60–80% of patients) in North America and Europe. By contrast, the frequency of AMAN ranges from 6–7% in the UK and Spain to 30–65% in Asia, Central America and South America. The geographical diversity is probably attributable to differences in exposure to certain types of infection, possibly in combination with different genetic susceptibilities due to varying genetic polymorphisms between individuals or groups of people living in different areas of the world. These differences may be related not only to the development of a specific GBS subtype, but also to the course and severity of disease. Genetic studies with a high number of patients are required to investigate these relationships.

These differences may be related not only to the development of a specific GBS subtype, but also to the course and severity of disease. Genetic studies with a high number of patients are required to investigate these relationships. Pathogenesis: As indicated above, GBS is a postinfectious disorder. Two-thirds of patients report symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection before the onset of GBS. In about half of patients with GBS, a specific type of preceding infection can be identified, and C. jejuni is responsible for at least one-third of these infections. Other pathogens that cause antecedent infections related to GBS are cytomegalovirus, Epstein– Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, and influenza A virus. Notably, a case–control study conducted in the Netherlands showed that 5% of patients with GBS had a hepatitis E virus infection before onset of GBS, compared with 0.5% of matched healthy controls. Similarly, 10% of patients with GBS from Bangladesh had an antecedent hepatitis E virus infection, indicating that hepatitis E virus is a worldwide trigger of GBS.30 However, despite the strong association between specific acute infections and GBS, the overall risk of developing this severe postinfectious complication is very small. Only one in 1,000–5,000 patients with Campylobacter enteritis will develop GBS in the subsequent 2 months.This fact explains why GBS is a sporadic disorder, although outbreaks of GBS after C. jejuni infection have occasionally been reported. One of the critical steps in GBS pathogenesis after C. jejuni infection is the generation of antibodies that crossreact with specific gangliosides (Figure 2), which are not produced during uncomplicated C. jejuni gastroenteritis. However, the production of crossreactive antibodies is only induced in susceptible individuals. Antibodies that crossreact with various gangliosides have been described in patients with GBS. However, only a subset of C. jejuni strains contain lipo-oligosaccharides that mimic the carbohydrate moiety of gangliosides that are present in human peripheral nerves (Figure 2). The synthesis of these ganglioside-mimicking carbohydrate structures depends on a set of polymorphic genes and enzymes that vary greatly between different C. jejuni strains. The Thr51 variant of the C. jejunicstII gene is associated with the occurrence of GBS, while the Asn51 variant is associated with MFS. Some antibody specificities are associated with particular GBS subtypes and related neurological deficits, reflecting the distribution of different gangliosides in human peripheral nerves (Table 1). C. jejuni infections are predominantly, but not exclusively, related to the AMAN or pure motor subtype of GBS. Patients with AMAN frequently have serum antibodies against GM1a, GM1b, GD1a and GalNAc-GD1a gangliosides. Patients with MFS or MFS–GBS overlap syndrome (see below) frequently have antibodies against GD1b, GD3, GT1a and GQ1b gangliosides, which are related to ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. In a study from the Netherlands, 20% of patients with AIDP related to cytomegalovirus infection had anti-GM2 antibodies, although these antibodies are also found in patients with uncomplicated cytomegalovirus infections. Interestingly, as well as antibodies against single ganglio sides, patients can also have antibodies against combinations of epitopes from ganglioside complexes. Such complexes are located in specialized microdomains, or ‘lipid rafts’, in the cell membrane. Antibodies that target ganglioside complexes also crossreact with C. jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides, and are probably induced by a preceding infection with C. jejuni. Antibodies against various combinations or complexes of glycolipids have also been reported in patients with AIDP, although the role of these antibodies in its pathogenesis remains to be determined. Figure 2 | Immunopathogenesis of GBS: molecular mimicry and antiganglioside antibodies. Infections with pathogens, such as Campylobacter jejuni, can trigger humoral immune and autoimmune responses that result in nerve dysfunction and the symptoms of GBS. Lipo-oligosaccharides on the C. jejuni outer membrane may elicit the production of antibodies that crossreact with gangliosides, such as GM1 and GD1a on peripheral nerves. The antigens targeted in AMAN are located at or near the node of Ranvier. The anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies bind to the nodal axolemma, leading to complement activation followed by MAC formation and disappearance of voltage-gated sodium channels. This damage can lead to detachment of paranodal myelin, and nerve conduction failure. Macrophages then invade from the nodes into the periaxonal space, scavenging the injured axons. The antigens targeted in AIDP are, presumably, located on the myelin sheath. The antibodies can activate complement, which leads to formation of the MAC on the outer surface of Schwann cells, initiation of vesicular degeneration, and invasion of myelin by macrophages. Abbreviations: AIDP, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; AMAN, acute motor axonal neuropathy; APC, antigen-presenting cell; GBS, Guillain–Barré syndrome; MAC, membrane attack complex. In conjunction with the presence of antiganglioside antibodies, complement activation seems to contribute to nerve degeneration in GBS—a phenomenon that has been studied at the nodes of Ranvier and at the motor nerve terminal in a mouse model of AMAN. Sodium channel clusters, as well as paranodal axoglial junctions, the nodal cytoskeleton, and Schwann cell microvilli, all of which stabilize the sodium channel clusters, were disrupted by complement activation in a GBS disease model. Additional studies in a GBS mouse model provided evidence that blockade of complement activation prevents emergence of the clinical signs of antiganglioside-mediated neuropathy.61 The development of GBS after a C. jejuni infection may also depend on patient-related factors that influence the susceptibility to produce crossreactive, carbohydratetargeted antibodies. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that GBS has a relapse rate of 5%, which is clearly higher than would be expected by chance. The initial pathogen–host interaction has a key role in the development of GBS. C. jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides bind to siglec-7 (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 7) and activate dendritic cells via Toll-like receptor 4 and CD14. These dendritic cells produce type 1 interferon and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which induce proliferation of B cells. This immune activation could be influenced by genetic polymorphisms but, to date, genetic factors have only been studied in small cohorts of patients. Interestingly, a meta-analysis identified a moderate association between GBS and a particular TNF polymorphism. In addition, an association between polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene (encoding mannose-binding protein C) and the severity and outcome of GBS has been confirmed. Future genome wide association studies in large, well-described and adequately controlled cohorts are required to establish the role of host factors in the pathogenesis of GBS. The potential role of vaccination: A few patients develop GBS shortly after receiving a vaccination. Despite their rarity, such events cause con siderable public concern. In the vaccination campaign against influenza A (H1N1) in the USA in 1976, the estimated attributable risk of vaccine-related GBS was about one in 100,000.66 A similar association was suggested for the vaccination campaign against influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, but extensive national and international studies found that vaccination was associated with only a small attributable risk of GBS: 1.6 excess cases of GBS per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients, a frequency similar to that for all seasonal vaccinations. In fact, vaccination might even reduce the risk of acquiring GBS, as this condition can be caused by infections such as influenza. The risk of developing GBS after influenza infection is estimated to be 4–7 times higher than after influenza vaccination. No relapses of GBS in patients with a history of this disease have been observed after influenza vaccination. For these reasons, the following practical guideline regarding vaccination of patients with a history of GBS is currently used in the Netherlands: GBS as such is not an indication for influenza vaccination, and vaccination seems to be safe in patients who developed GBS >3 months ago and when onset of GBS was not shortly after vaccination. Diagnosis: Diagnostic criteria: In 1978, the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) developed case definitions for GBS in the course of investigating the suspected association between GBS and the swine flu vaccination campaign of 1976–1977. The initial diagnostic criteria published in 1981 were modified in 1990. Though primarily developed for research purposes, they are probably still the most widely used criteria in clinical practice.4 The criteria consist of features that are required for or strongly support the diagnosis of GBS, and features that cast doubt on the diagnosis (Box 1). In 2011, the Brighton Collaboration published new case definitions for GBS while studying a possible association between GBS and the H1N1 swine flu vaccination campaign of 2009–2010. These criteria were specifically developed for retrospective epidemiological and vaccine safety studies and, consequently, are likely to combine high specificity with limited sensitivity. The Brighton criteria identify GBS with four levels of diagnostic certainty, from level 1 (highest) to level 4 (lowest). Use of the Brighton criteria to classify patients with suspected GBS is highly dependent on completeness of the diagnostic data. A study from the Netherlands in 335 patients with GBS with complete sets of diagnostic data—which are required for level 1 certainty according to the Brighton criteria—classified 61% as level 1, 33% as level 2, none as level 3 and 6% as level 4. However, patients diagnosed at different levels of diagnostic certainty did not differ in disease severity or outcome. In studies from Korea and India in patients who had GBS, 24% and 14% of patients, respectively, were classified as level 4. The Brighton criteria are not, however, intended to be used for diagnostic purposes in clinical practice. Further research is needed to develop criteria that can be used to diagnose GBS and its less-frequent variants in the acute phase of the disease. However, in practice, the criteria published in 1990 still provide a good basis for clinicians worldwide to make a diagnosis of GBS. Treatment: Treatment of GBS usually combines multidisciplinary supportive medical care and immunotherapy. Proven effective treatments for GBS are IVIg and plasma exchange. Immunotherapy is usually started if patients are not able to walk 10 m unaided (GBS Disability Scale score ≥3). Plasma exchange and IVIg have pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects, but we have yet to establish which effects explain their therapeutic efficacy in GBS, and whether the same effects are involved in all patients and all subtypes of GBS. IVIg treatment may inhibit Fc-mediated activation of immune cells, binding of antiganglioside antibodies to their neural targets or local complement activation. Serum IgG Fc glycosylation in patients with GBS seems to be associated with disease severity and could influence the immunomodulatory effects of IVIg. Plasma exchange is thought to remove neurotoxic antibodies, complement factors and other humoral mediators of inflammation. Plasma exchange is beneficial when performed within the first 4 weeks after onset of weakness in patients who are unable to walk unaided (GBS Disability Scale score ≥3), but the largest effect is seen when treatment is started within the first 2 weeks. The usual plasma exchange regimen consists of five treatments administered over 2 weeks, involving a total of about five plasma volumes. In mildly affected patients (still able to walk), however, two plasma exchange sessions induced more-rapid onset of motor recovery than did no plasma exchange. IVIg is effective in patients who are unable to walk 10 m unaided (GBS Disability Scale score ≥3) and when started within 2 weeks of onset of weakness. Randomized controlled trials showed that IVIg at a dose of 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 consecutive days (or 1 g/kg daily for 2 days) was as effective as a full course of five plasma exchange sessions applied over 2 weeks. Whether rapid IVIg treatment over 2 days is superior to treatment with the same total dose (2 g/kg) administered over 5 days has not been fully evaluated. However, one trial demonstrated that children receiving treatment over 2 days more frequently had treatment-related fluctuations than did children receiving treatment over 5 days. As IVIg therapy is widely available, does not require special equipment, and generally has only minor adverse effects, it has replaced plasma exchange as the preferred treatment for GBS in many hospitals. Immunoabsorption, as an alternative to plasma exchange, is occasionally used as a treatment for patients with GBS, and may be equally effective. However, no large-scale randomized controlled trials have shown that treatments other than IVIg or plasma exchange are effective. The choice of treatment depends on both patientrelated and socioeconomic factors. For instance, plasma exchange requires special equipment and is not always available in all hospitals. In addition, plasma exchange can be difficult to perform in young children, and care should be taken in patients with autonomic cardiovascular instability because of the large volume shifts involved in the plasma exchange procedure. However, the direct costs of IVIg treatment can be more than twice those of plasma exchange, making this treatment less attractive in low-income countries. In this respect, it is important to remember that most clinical trials of these treatments were conducted in Western Europe or North America and, therefore, predominantly involved patients who fulfilled the most commonly used GBS diagnostic criteria.4 The results of these trials might be less applicable in other parts of the world, especially where AMAN is highly prevalent. Whether patients with AMAN should receive the same treatment as those with AIDP remains uncertain. Results from a small study, which unfortunately had some methodological flaws, suggested that patients with AMAN might have better outcomes after treatment with plasma exchange than after IVIg therapy, and that plasma exchange was also the most cost-effective option. However, in countries where plasma exchange machines are not widely available or patients cannot afford this expensive procedure, small-volume plasma exchange or exchange transfusion can be a low-cost therapeutic option. Controlled studies of these procedures are currently lacking. The combination of plasma exchange followed by IVIg is not significantly better than either plasma exchange or IVIg alone. Oral steroids and intravenous methylprednisolone are not beneficial in patients with GBS. The combination of IVIg and methylprednisolone is no more effective than IVIg alone, although this combined treatment might have some additional short-term benefits when known prognostic factors are taken into account. Small randomized placebo-controlled trials of IFN-β1a and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and one trial studying a 6 week course of mycophenolate mofetil combined with standard IVIg versus IVIg alone, did not indicate beneficial effects of these treatments. No randomized controlled trials have been performed in patients with MFS.126 A retrospective analysis showed that recovery starts slightly earlier in patients with MFS treated with IVIg than in those who were treated with plasma exchange or received no immunotherapy. However, final outcomes were the same in all three groups. Indeed, almost all patients with MFS recover fully, irrespective of whether they receive immunotherapy. Owing to the lack of evidence of a beneficial effect of IVIg or plasma exchange in patients with MFS, combined with the good natural recovery seen in these patients, withholding of immunotherapy in patients with MFS seems currently justified. However, patients with MFS–GBS overlap syndrome can be severely affected, and treatment with IVIg or plasma exchange remains an option for these patients. Notably, no large-scale randomized controlled trials have been performed to determine the optimal treatment strategy in children with GBS and they are, therefore, usually treated in the same manner as adults with GBS. Ongoing research: Nearly a century after it was first described, GBS is still a life-threatening disorder that results in a poor outcome in at least 20% of patients and has persistent residual effects in the majority. Further research is urgently required to improve this situation. From a clinical perspective, the following are the most challenging needs: to develop improved diagnostic criteria for use in daily clinical practice, trials and vaccine safety studies; to determine the burden of disease caused by GBS worldwide; to develop new and better GBS outcome measures; to establish the precipitating events and patient-related factors that lead to GBS; to define biological and clinical predictors of the clinical course and outcome in individual patients; and, most importantly, to develop moreeffective and specific treatments, as well as protocols for supportive care. These aims can probably only be achieved by largescale international and multidisciplinary collaborations, such as the International GBS Outcome Study (IGOS), which was launched in 2012. Tissue samples and detailed, standardized clinical data are being collected during a follow-up period of 1–3 years with the intention of including at least 1,000 patients with GBS from all over the world. At present, centres from 17 countries— Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Spain, South Africa, Taiwan, UK and the USA—are recruiting patients. In addition, a randomized controlled trial, the SID-GBS study, is being conducted in the Netherlands. This trial is investigating the effect of a second course of IVIg given shortly after the first course in patients with GBS who have a poor prognosis (defined as a mEGOS score of 6–12 at 1 week after initiation of a standard 5 day course of IVIg). A related international study with an observational prospective design (I-SID-GBS) is investigating the same approach. This study is part of IGOS and is being performed by the Inflammatory Neuropathy Consortium. In addition, a new randomized placebo-controlled trial of eculizumab in patients with early GBS who are unable to walk is about to start. This study is partly based on findings in an animal model of GBS, in which antiganglioside antibodies induce complementdependent damage at the nodes of Ranvier, nerve terminals, and perisynaptic Schwann cells (Figure 2). Notably, these deleterious effects of complement on nerve terminals in mice can be blocked by the administration of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement factor C5 and prevents its cleavage to C5a and the proinflammatory, cytolytic C5b-9 complex.61 Many other studies, such as those investigating pain treatment, nerve regeneration, and other factors that may improve the outcomes of patients with GBS, are eagerly awaited. Litrature Review: The understanding of the disease mechanism of Guillain–Barré syndrome has evolved in recent years. Development of new treatments has been limited since immunotherapy was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s. An animal model (experimental autoimmune neuritis in rats) is often used for studies, and some agents have shown promise: glatiramer acetate, quinupramine, fasudil (an inhibitor of the Rhokinase enzyme) and the heart drug flecainide. An antibody targeted against the anti-GD3 antiganglioside antibody has shown benefit in laboratory research. Given the role of the complement system in GBS, it has been suggested that complement inhibitors (such as the drug eculizumab) may be effective Sara Morsy et.al (2020) : The study suggests that NCAM may play a significant role in the immunopathogenesis of GBS. NCAM antibodies can be used as a marker for Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, more experimental studies are needed to prove these results. This study aimed at identifying human neural proteins that can be attacked by cross-reacting SARS-COV-2 antibodies causing Guillain-Barré syndrome. These markers can be used for the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). To achieve this goal, proteins implicated in the development of GBS were retrieved from literature. These human proteins were compared to SARS-COV-2 surface proteins to identify homologous sequences using Blastp. Then, MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes were determined in the homologous sequences and used for further analysis. Similar human and SARS-COV-2 epitopes were docked to the corresponding MHC molecule to compare the binding pattern of human and SARS-COV-2 proteins to the MHC molecule. Badshah et al (2019) : The Zika virus (ZIKV) has gained attention for the last few years due to the congenital microcephaly and Guillain–Barre Syndrome that resulted in humans. The non-structural protein (NS3) helicase of ZIKV play an important role in viral RNA replication. In this article, the researchers performed hundred nanosecond molecular dynamics simulation and molecular docking of the NS3 helicase of ZIKV with 1,4-benzothiazine derivatives. Pier Paolo Sainaghi et al (2010) : Patients and methods: CSF samples were collected during a diagnostic lumbar puncture and stored at 30 C.Weanalyzed the CSF of nine subjects with GBS; eight with CIDP; eight with diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) and seven with headache (controls). Fifty inflammatory mediators were simultaneously measured with a multiplex bead-based ELISA on a Suspension Array System. After Bonferroni’s correction for repeated measures, non-parametric variance and post hoc test were calculated. Results: Thirty-two inflammatory mediators were expressed. The median concentration of IL-6, IL-9, IL15, IL-18, CCL4, CXCL1, LIF, MIF, PDGFbb, IFN-c2, IL-2ra, IL-12(p40), IL-16, SCGF-b, TRAIL, FGF, G-CSF, GMCSF, and M-CSF was not different among groups (variance: n.s.). The median concentration of CCL2, CCL7, CCL27, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12, ICAM1, VCAM1 and VEGF was higher in CIDP and GBS compared with controls (p < 0.002). The median concentration of IL-8 and IL-1ra was higher in GBS than CIDP or DP or controls, whereas stem cell factor (SCF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were higher in CIDP than GBS or DP or controls (p < 0.002). Michiaki Koga et al (2023) Objective : To investigate the frequency of serum autoantibodies targeting contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) and its complexes with other paranode antigens, contactin-1 (CNTN1) and neurofascin 155 (NF155), in Japanese patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Results :Anti-Caspr1 antibodies were present in one participant (case 1, 3.8%) of CIDP, and negative in all Guillain–Barré syndrome patients and healthy participant. The detected anti-Caspr1 antibodies predominantly belonged to the immunoglobulin G4 subclass, and the addition of CNTN1 to Caspr1 as an antigen increased antibody reactivity, although the increase was just 20–30% at most. The presence of autoantibodies against paranode protein complexes, including Caspr1/CNTN1, Caspr1/NF155 and Caspr1/CNTN1/NF155, was confirmed in several CIDP patients, although they also had anti-Caspr1 or anti-NF155 antibodies; thus, in our cohort, there were no patients with autoantibodies that specifically recognized paranode protein complexes. J´ er ˆome J. Devaux , Masaaki Odaka , and Nobuhiro Yuki (2012) Neurofascin-186 (NF186), neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM), and gliomedin are adhesion molecules playing a central role in the formation of nodes of Ranvier. In Guillain-Barr´ e syndrome (GBS), immune attack toward the nodes may participate in the disabilities. Autoantibodies to NF186 and gliomedin have been detected in a rat model of GBS. Here, researcher investigated the prevalence of antibodies against nodal adhesion molecules in patients with GBS or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Mingyun Shen et al (2013) : Rho kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) belong to serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase family, and play the central roles in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, Rho kinases have become attractive targets for the treatments of many diseases, such as cancer, renal disease, hypertension, ischemia, and stroke. In order to develop small-molecule inhibitors of ROCK1, molecular docking was utilized to virtually screen two chemical databases and identify molecules that interact with ROCK1. Marc’s Jacobs et.al (2005): The ROCK protein consists of several domains: an N-terminal region, a kinase catalytic domain, a coiled-coil domain containing a RhoA binding site, and a pleckstrin homology domain. The Cterminal region of ROCK binds to and inhibits the kinase catalytic domains, and this inhibition is reversed by binding RhoA, a small GTPase. This report present the structure of the N-terminal region and the kinase domain. In given protein two N-terminal regions interact to form a dimerization domain linking two kinase domains together. This spatial arrangement presents the kinase active sites and regulatory sequences on a common face affording the possibility of both kinases simultaneously interacting with a dimeric inhibitory domain or with a dimeric substrate. The kinase domain adopts a catalytically competent conformation; however, no phosphorylation of active site residues is observed in the structure. They also determined the structures of ROCK bound to four different ATP competitive small molecule inhibitors (Y-27632, fasudil , hydroxyfasudil, and H-1152P) Molecular Docking: Molecular Docking is performed in four important steps – 1) Protein preparation 2) Ligand preparation 3) Receptor grid generation 4) Molecular docking (Ligand docking) Protein Preparation: Preparing a protein for molecular docking, especially for rho kinase (ROCK), involves a meticulous series of steps aimed at ensuring its structural integrity and suitability for computational analysis. Firstly, the crystal structure of rho kinase is retrieved from a reliable protein structure database like the Protein Data Bank (PDB), ensuring high resolution and relevant ligands or co-factors if needed. Subsequently, the protein structure undergoes thorough preparation, which includes removing water molecules, heteroatoms, and any extraneous entities not pertinent to the docking study. Any structural irregularities or missing residues are corrected, and any hydrogen atoms missing from the structure are added. Energy minimization is then performed to alleviate steric clashes and optimize the protein's conformation for docking, utilizing molecular modeling software such as GROMACS, CHARMM, or Schrödinger suite, along with an appropriate force field. Ligands intended for docking undergo a similar preparation process, including removal of water molecules and energy minimization to attain stable conformations. The next step involves defining a docking grid around the active site of rho kinase, crucial for guiding the docking software in predicting accurate ligand binding poses. Molecular docking is then executed using specialized software such as AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, or GOLD, docking the prepared ligands into the active site and assessing the binding affinities of resultant complexes. Following docking, thorough analysis and visualization of results are conducted to identify potential ligand-protein interactions and select promising ligand poses, facilitated by molecular visualization tools like PyMOL or VMD. Validation of docking results through experimental assays, such as enzyme inhibition assays or biochemical assays, is imperative to confirm predicted binding interactions. Further optimization may be pursued based on docking results and experimental validation, including refining ligands or conducting additional rounds of docking with modified ligands to enhance binding affinities and selectivity. Finally, meticulous documentation of all steps undertaken during protein preparation and docking is essential for reproducibility and dissemination of findings to the scientific community through publications or presentations. Fig: Rho Kinase Ligand Preparation: In the realm of molecular docking studies, the preparation of ligands stands as a pivotal phase, ensuring their readiness for accurate binding within the protein's active site. A comprehensive approach to ligand preparation entails several systematic steps. Initially, the 2D or 3D structure of the ligand of interest is acquired from reputable chemical databases like PubChem, ChEMBL, or ZINC, with utmost attention to ensuring compatibility with molecular modeling software. Following this, the ligand structure undergoes rigorous standardization, where potential errors such as missing atoms or bonds, incorrect valence, or inconsistent bond orders are meticulously addressed using sophisticated chemical structure editing tools such as Open Babel or RDKit. Subsequently, the determination of the ligand's protonation state at physiological pH, often around pH 7.4, is crucial. This task is accomplished using tools like MarvinSketch, Epik (Schrödinger suite), or online platforms like PROPKA. Energy minimization then ensues, aiming to optimize the ligand's geometry and eliminate steric clashes through the employment of molecular modeling software such as RDKit, Avogadro, or Schrödinger suite. The exploration of potential bioactive conformations involves the generation of tautomers and stereoisomers of the ligand, facilitated by advanced software tools like OpenEye Omega or Schrödinger's LigPrep. Additionally, the ligand's flexibility and binding modes are further scrutinized through the generation of multiple conformations using techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations or conformational sampling algorithms available in software tools like RDKit or OMEGA. The consideration of solvation effects is pivotal in accurate docking calculations, prompting the removal of explicit water molecules from the ligand's structure. Subsequent to the preparation steps, the ligand structure undergoes conversion into formats compatible with molecular docking software such as PDBQT, MOL2, or SDF. Validation of the prepared ligands is then conducted by comparing them with known bioactive conformations or experimental data, where available, to ensure reliability. Finally, meticulous documentation of all ligand preparation steps, inclusive of software tools used and parameters applied, is imperative for fostering reproducibility and facilitating the dissemination of findings within the scientific community. By adhering to this comprehensive approach, ligands are meticulously primed for molecular docking studies, thereby augmenting the accuracy and reliability of ensuing docking results.

Its pharmacological mechanism involves inhibiting Rho kinase, an enzyme pivotal in smooth muscle contraction and cellular motility regulation. By impeding Rho kinase activity, fasudil facilitates vasodilation, which enhances blood flow and mitigates vasospasm. Although fasudil itself is not found in nature, the physiological pathways it influences are intrinsic to human biology. Fasudil Receptor grid generation: Receptor grid generation stands as a pivotal stage in molecular docking studies, delineating the search space within the protein where ligands will engage in binding interactions. This critical process encompasses several meticulous steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of subsequent docking calculations. Initially, the active site or binding pocket within the protein is meticulously identified, drawing upon experimental data from crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes or employing computational methods like binding site prediction algorithms. Subsequently, the dimensions of the grid box enclosing the active site are precisely defined, striking a balance between accommodating potential ligand binding orientations and maintaining computational efficiency. Determining the spacing between grid points within the grid box follows suit, ensuring adequate sampling of space for ligand binding without unduly prolonging computational time. Utilizing dedicated molecular docking software, such as AutoDockTools for AutoDock or Schrödinger's Glide for Glide, facilitates the generation of the receptor grid, incorporating tools specifically designed for this purpose. Centering the grid box coordinates around the active site ensures that ligands are docked within the pertinent region of the protein, optimizing docking accuracy. Visualizing the receptor grid using sophisticated visualization tools like PyMOL, VMD, or UCSF Chimera ensures its adequate coverage of the active site and the space where ligands are anticipated to bind. Validation of the generated receptor grid is imperative, necessitating comparison with experimental data or known binding poses of ligands to ascertain its fidelity in representing the binding site and facilitating accurate docking calculations. Comprehensive documentation of the parameters employed for receptor grid generation, encompassing grid dimensions, spacing, and center coordinates, underpins reproducibility and facilitates the dissemination of findings within the scientific community. By meticulously adhering to these steps, a receptor grid conducive to molecular docking studies is generated, enabling the precise prediction of ligand binding poses and affinities within the protein's active site.

GBS, characterized by the immune system's attack on peripheral nerves, leads to symptoms ranging from weakness and tingling to severe paralysis. Treatment modalities such as plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) and immunoglobulin therapy remain the cornerstone of managing acute GBS cases, underlining the critical need for hospitalization and multidisciplinary care. **Molecular Data Insights and Therapeutic Implications:** Among the investigated natural compounds through molecular docking studies - Fasudil, Quercetin, Kaempferol, Berberine, Pseudocoptisine, and Centaurein - certain patterns and potential therapeutic avenues emerge: 1. **Fasudil**, exhibiting the highest binding affinity to Rho kinase (ROCK), validates its role in treating cerebral vasospasm, an associated complication of GBS in severe cases. Its potent binding efficacy suggests it might also aid in alleviating symptoms of GBS by modulating similar pathways, emphasizing its value in further GBS-related therapeutic research. 2. **Quercetin and Kaempferol** demonstrated notable binding affinities, reinforcing their roles as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Given the inflammatory nature of GBS, these compounds could potentially offer adjunct therapeutic benefits, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in GBS patients. 3. **Berberine and Pseudocoptisine**, despite showing relatively weaker binding affinities, still possess pharmacological interests due to their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and possibly neuroprotective effects. Their roles in modulating immune responses and protecting nerve cells could offer new dimensions in GBS management, warranting further experimental validations. 4. **Centaurein**, although showing the weakest binding potential among the tested compounds, might possess undiscovered mechanisms beneficial for neuroprotection or immunomodulation. Its potential in GBS treatment, despite being speculative, emphasizes the need for broader research perspectives on naturally occurring compounds. **Broader Implications:** The molecular docking data underscores the potential of natural compounds in modulating pathways relevant to GBS, suggesting a promising avenue for discovering novel therapeutics or adjunct treatments. It highlights the intricate interplay between immune responses and neural health and the potential of targeted molecular interventions in managing conditions like GBS. **Future Directions:** This study suggests several critical directions for future research: - Experimental validation of molecular docking data through in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the therapeutic efficacy of highlighted compounds in GBS models. - Investigation into the synergistic effects of these compounds with current GBS treatments to enhance patient recovery outcomes. - Exploration of other natural compounds with potential neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects, expanding the arsenal against GBS and similar autoimmune/neurological conditions. - Development of precise molecular techniques to target specific pathways involved in GBS, leveraging advanced drug design and delivery systems to improve treatment specificity and reduce side effects. **Conclusion:** The amalgamation of detailed GBS information with molecular docking data of natural compounds offers a promising vista into understanding GBS's pathophysiology and exploring novel therapeutic strategies. While current treatments focus on symptom management and preventing complications, the potential of natural compounds in modulating immune and neural pathways opens new doors for treatment innovations in GBS and related autoimmune neurologic disorders. Continued research in this direction is essential to translate these molecular insights into clinical therapies, aiming for more effective, targeted, and less invasive treatment modalities for Guillain Barré Syndrome."},{"instruction":"need lisin poist totle 5 wrds - Caption: \\"AI is changing the way we live every day, transforming how we use technology, make choices, and find information.

Today, we're diving into an effective and powerful exercise: the Dumbbell Incline Hammer Press. This isn't just any chest workout; it's a game-changer that targets your upper chest, giving it a fuller and more defined look. So, grab your workout gear, and let's get started on mastering this incredible exercise. # Understanding the Dumbbell Incline Hammer Press The Dumbbell Incline Hammer Press is a variation of the traditional chest press but performed on an incline bench. What sets it apart is the grip you use – like holding a hammer. This grip and the incline position of your body work together to put more focus on the upper part of your chest muscles. It's a fantastic way to add variety to your workout and target muscles from different angles. # Why You Should Incorporate It Into Your Routine Adding this exercise to your routine boosts your upper chest's size and strength. It's not just about looking good; it's about improving your performance in other exercises and sports by providing a balanced upper body strength. Plus, it helps in preventing muscle imbalances and injuries, making your fitness journey smoother and safer. # The Workout: Sets and Reps To truly benefit from the Dumbbell Incline Hammer Press, incorporating it into a balanced workout routine is essential. Here's a suggestion for integrating it into your chest day: 1. **Dumbbell Incline Hammer Press:** - Sets: 4 - Reps: 8-12 2. **Flat Bench Dumbbell Press:** - Sets: 4 - Reps: 8-12 3. **Incline Dumbbell Flyes:** - Sets: 3 - Reps: 10-15 4. **Push-ups:** - Sets: 3 - As many reps as possible This routine balances pushing movements with isolation work, targeting your whole chest. Aim to do this workout once or twice a week, depending largely on your overall routine and recovery. # Weekly Frequency For the best results, incorporate this workout into your chest regime once or twice a week. However, it's crucial not to overdo it. Your muscles need time to recover and grow. Always listen to your body and give it the rest it needs. # Step-by-Step Instructions Performing the Dumbbell Incline Hammer Press with proper form is key to getting the most out of the exercise and avoiding injuries. Here’s how to do it: 1. **Setting Up:** - Start by adjusting your bench to an incline position, usually between 30 to 45 degrees. - Sit on the bench with a dumbbell in each hand, resting them on your thighs. Make sure you're gripping the dumbbells like you would a hammer. 2. **Getting Into Position:** - Kick your knees upward one at a time to bring the dumbbells up, positioning them at chest level. - Keep your palms facing each other, and the dumbbells should be close but not touching. 3. **The Movement:** - Push the dumbbells up and slightly towards each other in an arc motion until your arms are extended above you. Be careful not to lock your elbows. - Pause for a second at the top and then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. 4. **Breathing:** - Inhale as you lower the dumbbells, and exhale as you push them up. Proper breathing ensures better performance and safety during the exercise. # Tips for Success - **Focus on Form:** Before adding more weight, ensure you're performing the exercise with correct form. Quality over quantity always leads to better results and fewer injuries. - **Progress Slowly:** Gradually increase the weight you're lifting. It's tempting to jump ahead, but slow and steady wins the race. - **Mind-Muscle Connection:** Pay attention to your chest muscles as you perform the exercise. Imagine them working and growing with each repetition. - **Warm-Up:** Always start your workout with a good warm-up to prepare your muscles and reduce the risk of injury. # Closing Thoughts The Dumbbell Incline Hammer Press is a powerful addition to your workout regimen, perfect for shaping and strengthening your upper chest. Remember, patience and consistency are your best friends on this journey. Combining this exercise with a well-rounded fitness routine and a healthy diet will set you on the path to achieving the chest goals you’ve always wanted.

Mystery at the beach! I couldn't resist. Also, has anyone seen my sanity around here?\\" [The gang, while exasperated, assists Fred in setting a trap. Instead of the shark, they end up catching the local lifeguard, who's been practicing for a mascot competition.] **Lifeguard Larry**: \\"Dude, I'm just trying to win the mascot marathon!

If yes, how many and in which chapter(s)?","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, \\"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale\\" is a seminal paper published by researchers at Google. The paper introduces the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, an approach that applies the transformer model, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, directly to sequences of image patches for image recognition tasks. The paper marked a significant shift in how the research community approaches image recognition problems, showing that transformers can achieve excellent results even in domains outside of NLP. Regarding your question about whether this publication has been integrated and in which chapters or how many publications: 1. **Integration in Academic and Research Publications**: The paper has had a significant impact on the field of computer vision and has been cited by numerous subsequent studies. These citations span various domains, including but not limited to, improvements to the Vision Transformer architecture, adaptations to different tasks beyond image recognition (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation), and theoretical analyses of why transformers work well for image data. These citations can be found in articles and reports across a broad array of scientific journals and conference proceedings. 2. **Integration in Books or Comprehensive Surveys**: For comprehensive, thematic, or textbook-style works, this paper's contributions might be discussed in chapters covering deep learning approaches to computer vision, particularly those focusing on the evolution and application of transformer models in image recognition and beyond. Given the innovative application of transformers to image data by this work, it could be featured in sections detailing the history and development of image recognition technologies, discussions on transformer architectures, or examinations of cutting-edge machine learning trends. 3. **Exact Numbers and Chapters**: Providing an exact number of publications integrating this work or specifying chapters without knowing a specific book or review article context is challenging. The integration and discussion of the ViT paper would vary widely depending on the publication's focus, whether it's a broad overview of machine learning or a deep dive into transformers or computer vision. If you're looking for how this paper has been integrated into a specific book, journal, or course material, it would be helpful to access academic databases or the syllabus/course outlines of relevant computer science or AI programs. Such sources might provide detailed bibliographies or citations pointing to how and where this influential paper has been discussed or integrated."},{"instruction":"DateTimeField отображается как строчное поле","output":", которое позволяет пользователю выбрать дату и время.

Im Kuhstall gefunden, in der Nacht verloren, haben wir uns an diesen Ort, für immer geschworen. (Chorus) Im Kuhstall, da drehen wir alle durch, zwischen Beats und Glühwein, finden wir die Flucht. St. Jakob leuchtet, zeigt uns wie es geht, Apres Ski, hier wo das Herz höherschlägt. Wir lassen los, die Hütte bebt, das ist unser Revier, im Kuhstall in St. Jakob feiern wir. (Outro) St. Jakob, unsere Winterliebe, so rein und klar, wir kommen wieder, nächstes Jahr. Denn nur hier, lässt sich so ausflippen, ohne Sorgen, St. Jakob, du bist unser Morgen."},{"instruction":"Schreibe ihn moderner","output":"(Strophe 1) Da wo die Peaks in St. Jakob den Himmel berühr'n, finden wir unseren Beat, lass die Sorgen hinter der Tür. Auf den Boards gleiten, Freiheit im Gesicht, diese Vibes, diese Views, brauchen kein Gedicht. Scroll durch deinen Feed, doch hier lebt die Story, St. Jakob die Basis, für den echten Party-Glory. Wenn die Pisten schließen, fängt ein neues Spiel an, Kuhstall-Party, wo jeder flippt, Mann für Mann. (Pre-Chorus) Gib dir das Feeling, Eis und Feuer in der Vein, St. Jakob, wo die Nächte nie sind allein. Boost dein Herz, lass die Beats nie sterben, hier, wo wir die Sterne noch als Zeugen werben. (Chorus) Im Kuhstall blinken die Neonlights so bright, Zwischen Insta-Poses fühlen wir die Mitternachts-Euphorie so light. St. Jakob vibriert, oh, wir dreh'n auf, Apres Ski, hier treiben wir's auf die Spitze, nehmen den Lauf. Die Crowd geht ab, hier ist unser Beat das Tier, Kuhstall in St. Jakob, wir feiern, wir und unser Bier. (Strophe 2) Fernab von Standard, leben wir die Nacht, St. Jakob gibt uns Kraft, hat uns hierhergebracht. Von den Pisten in den Beat, keine Regeln, keine Limit, nur wir, die Musik, in diesem perfekten Klima-Transit. Snap das Glück, halt es fest, in deinem Digital-Frame, in St. Jakob, jeder Tag, eine Story, nicht lame. Mit jedem Beatdrop fühlen wir die Essenz, St. Jakob's Nächte, unsere Apres-Ski-Präsenz. (Pre-Chorus) Jetzt geh ab, lass den Moment nicht entweichen, wir sind die Könige, die Queens, in unseren Apres-Reichen. Fühl die Bassline, tief in deinem Herz, St. Jakob hält uns zusammen, vertreibt jeden Schmerz. (Chorus) Im Kuhstall blinken die Neonlights so bright, Zwischen Insta-Poses fühlen wir die Mitternachts-Euphorie so light. St. Jakob vibriert, oh, wir dreh'n auf, Apres Ski, hier treiben wir's auf die Spitze, nehmen den Lauf. Die Crowd geht ab, hier ist unser Beat das Tier, Kuhstall in St. Jakob, wir feiern, wir und unser Bier. (Bridge) Wo die Nacht uns umarmt, und der Tag nur ein Echo, da finden wir Glück, in St. Jakob, oh so perfekto. Im Kuhstall tanzen, bis die Sonne wieder lacht, hier in St. Jakob, haben wir die beste Nacht. (Chorus) Im Kuhstall blinken die Neonlights so bright, Zwischen Insta-Poses fühlen wir die Mitternachts-Euphorie so light. St. Jakob vibriert, oh, wir dreh'n auf, Apres Ski, hier treiben wir's auf die Spitze, nehmen den Lauf. Die Crowd geht ab, hier ist unser Beat das Tier, Kuhstall in St. Jakob, wir feiern, wir und unser Bier. (Outro) Also pack deinen Mut, bring dein Lächeln mit, in St. Jakob, da treffen sich Beats und der perfekte Tritt. Wir lassen uns treiben, durch die Nacht, ganz sorglos, Kuhstall in St. Jakob, unser Winter-Chaos."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
