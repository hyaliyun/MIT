You don't need to fill it all the way up, just enough to cover the bottom of the pot. 3. Put the pot on the stove: With the help of an adult, place the pot filled with water on the stove. 4. Turn the stove on: Ask the adult to turn on one of the stove's round circles, called burners, under the pot. It should start getting hot. 5. Wait for the water to boil: Watch the pot with the adult. You'll see small bubbles at the bottom of the pot first, and then bigger bubbles will start rushing to the top. When the water is bubbling a lot and making steam, it's boiling! 6. Turn off the stove: Once the water is boiling, ask the adult to turn off the stove for you. Be careful, because the pot and water will be very hot. And that's how you boil water!

However, Mr Spitzer's spokesman, Lisa Linden, has denied the accounts, adding: 'These assertions are totally untrue.' Friends of the pair also said claims were outrageous and wrong.

A cycling backpack can help improve your posture..  + Another type of cardiovascular exercise is jumping on your bike to increase your bdnf level. Try running for an hour every day for a week.. The answer is:","output":"+ Make sure to incorporate 10 to 20 minutes of fast-paced biking to increase your heart rate further. Bike around your neighborhood or local park. Explanation of other options: - Biking will improve your cardiovascular muscle abilities, including improved strength. Walk on a treadmill for 30 to 60 minutes with the solar psi machine: This option is unrelated to biking and BDNF, and the \\"solar psi machine\\" has no known connection to increasing BDNF levels. - If your conditions are serious or there is discomfort in your joints, wear loose-fitting, fashionable clothing such as long sleeves and underwear. A cycling backpack can help improve your posture: While adjusting clothing and using a cycling backpack may improve comfort during biking, they do not directly contribute to increasing BDNF levels. - Another type of cardiovascular exercise is jumping on your bike to increase your bdnf level. Try running for an hour every day for a week: This option is partly correct, as running is another form of cardiovascular exercise that can increase BDNF levels, but the focus of the question is on biking, making the first option more relevant."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Definition: In this task, we ask you to write a question that asks about \\"event duration\\", based on a given sentence. The question will likely start with \\"How long\\". Your question should be answerable based on the common knowledge of how long certain events usually last. Don't create questions which have explicit mentions of answers in the text. Instead, it has to be implied from what is given. In other words, we want you to use \\"instinct\\" or \\"common sense\\".

Output:","output":"Part #1: Write a question that asks about \\"event duration\\". Usage: How long does a typical story time last at the library? This question meets the criteria because it asks about the duration of an event, specifically story time at a library. Part #2: The question should be based on a given sentence. Usage: How long do children usually spend at the library during story time on Tuesdays? This example meets the criteria because it is based on the input sentence, which mentions the library, story time, and Tuesdays. Part #3: Questions will likely start with \\"How long\\". Usage: How long does it take for children to finish story time at the library? This meets the criteria because it starts with \\"How long\\" and asks about the duration of the event. Part #4: The question should be answerable based on the common knowledge of how long certain events usually last. Usage: How long do story time sessions at the library typically last for children? This meets the criteria because the answer can be guessed using common knowledge – i.e., that story time sessions at the library usually last for a short period, such as 30 minutes or an hour. Part #5: Don't create questions which have explicit mentions of answers in the text. Usage: How long do children generally spend at the library on Tuesdays for story time? This example meets the criteria because it doesn't ask for explicit information from the input sentence, but rather requires the use of common sense or instinct to guess the duration. Part #6: The written questions are not required to have a single correct answer. Usage: Approximately how long do children's story time sessions at the library last? This example meets the criteria because there isn't a single correct answer; instead, the answer could vary depending on the library and the specific story time event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Wrestling with feelings of guilt and regret, Larry must confront the dark secrets of his past, uncover the truth about Michael's untimely death, and reconnect with the family he left behind. Plot Summary: The film begins with Larry Montgomery (late 40s), living a prosperous but isolated life, immersed in his high-profile job as an architect in Manhattan. One night, he receives a phone call from his cousin Emma, explaining that his younger brother, Michael, has died in a car accident, and that his parents have requested him to return home for the funeral. Hesitant at first, Larry ultimately decides to confront his past and heads back to his hometown. Upon his arrival, he's met with mixed reactions. His parents, George and Edith, both harbor resentment towards him for leaving the family when they needed him the most. Larry accidentally abandoned them when his father's business went bankrupt. As Larry starts spending more time with his family, he begins to learn about the struggles that Michael faced in life - addiction, gambling debts, and the consequences of his troubled decisions. Though Larry feels responsible for not being there to help his brother, he learns from Emma, who now works as a nurse at the local hospital, that Michael was working hard to turn his life around before his death. Determined to uncover the truth about Michael's death, Larry delves deeper into the world his brother inhabited, discovering that the circumstances of the car accident may not be so cut and dry. With the help of Emma and their old friend, Tom, who is now a detective, they begin to investigate the accident and the people Michael was associated with before he died. Through his journey, Larry reconnects with the family and the town he abandoned two decades ago, and he begins to understand the value of human connections and forgiveness. As Larry unravels the mystery surrounding Michael's death, he also comes to terms with his own guilt, realizing that he can't change the past, but he can help rebuild the future for his family. Ultimately, Larry learns that Michael's death involved people he owed money to, and in an attempt to bring them to justice, he risks his own life to protect his family and seek redemption that he thinks will heal the wounds of the past. In the end, Larry decides to stay in the town, working alongside his father to revive the family business, and contributing his expertise to restore historic buildings in the community. He mends his relationship with his parents and becomes the supportive son and brother he always wished to be. \\"A Road Back Home\\" is a poignant, emotional journey that explores themes of family, forgiveness, redemption, and rediscovering the bonds that once were lost but never truly broken."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What does elm fight against when wet?\\" is in \\"Wood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters, houses and boats. Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction. Elm in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Elm wood fights against decay when it is wet. In the given text, it is mentioned that elm wood was particularly used for the construction of boats and as water pipes because of its natural resistance to decay as long as it remained wet. This characteristic made it an ideal material for these purposes, as it could withstand the constant exposure to water and moisture. The durability and strength of elm wood in wet conditions allowed it to maintain its structural integrity and prevented rotting, making it a valuable resource in the construction of watercraft and early plumbing systems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(2) The orbital data are consistent with the secondary component either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially mean the same thing, although there are subtle differences in their grammatical structure. Both sentences convey that the orbital data supports the idea that the secondary component in the system is either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star. Let's break down each sentence to explain the similarities and differences more clearly. 1. The orbital data is consistent with the secondary component being either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star. In this sentence, the subject is \\"the orbital data,\\" and \\"is\\" acts as the main verb. The phrase \\"consistent with\\" serves as a preposition, and the rest of the sentence functions as the object of that preposition. The object essentially describes the possible nature of the secondary component, stating that it could be either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star. 2. The orbital data are consistent with the secondary component either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star. In this sentence, the subject is once again \\"the orbital data,\\" but the main verb is \\"are\\" instead of \\"is.\\" This subtle change shifts the agreement between the subject and the verb, which could be attributed to different conventions in British and American English. British English tends to treat collective nouns (like \\"data\\") as plural, while American English typically considers them as singular. Additionally, the word \\"being\\" is omitted in this sentence, making a slight structural difference. However, the meaning remains the same - the secondary component could be a red dwarf or a white dwarf star, according to the orbital data. Overall, the meaning conveyed by both sentences is the same, despite minor differences in their grammatical structure. They both express the idea that the orbital data is in line with the secondary component being either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan dropped more bombs during the first quarter of 2018 than it has in the same period in any of the last 15 years, according to Pentagon data. The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources. But there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. \\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \\"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\\" Even high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate.

Jump off your board by placing your back foot onto the ground in front of the skateboard, and following with your front foot. Begin running in the direction that you were traveling in and only stop the board once you have slowed down and regained control. Practice your running technique from a stationary skateboard first. Once you have got the hang of this, try running from a moving board, in a quiet space. Only try this at the skate park after lots of practice. Bailing is when you opt out of a trick before you get hurt. If you know that you're about to fall hard, you can try and stop the trick before it's too late, and jump off your board. Rather a bruised ego, than a bruised leg!   It is important to kick your board away when bailing, as you don't want to land back on your board and slip over. If you kick forward there is a greater chance that you will land back on the board, so always kick the board behind you by kicking your legs back. Bailing isn't good for your board deck, and it will cause scratches and chips. However, it is better to bail and chip your board, than to not bail and hurt yourself. If a fall is inevitable, you need to use all your limbs to soften the impact. It is important to keep your arms and legs loose so that they can absorb the shock of the fall.   If you stiffen your body, there is a greater chance of you breaking bones. Keep those limbs loose! Don't break falls by using only your outstretched arms. Wrist injuries are rife in skateboarders, and this is going to hurt or cause you to break your wrists. It's a good idea to wear knee-pads and if you are going to fall whilst on a ramp, always fall on your knees. This will cause you to slide down the ramp, and avoid serious injury. Rolling distributes the impact of a fall and prevents serious injury. Remember to shield your face with your arms and aim to land on your back or shoulders. Practice falling correctly on a soft surface before you hit the skate park. This way you'll be prepared for future falls and falling safely will become second nature to you. Summary:","output":"1. Practice getting off the skateboard and running in a controlled manner to prevent falls. 2. Learn to bail and kick the board away from you if a fall is imminent. 3. Keep your limbs loose to absorb shock during a fall. 4. Avoid breaking falls with outstretched arms, as this can lead to wrist injuries. 5. Wear knee-pads and aim to fall on your knees when on a ramp. 6. Learn to roll during a fall to distribute impact and prevent serious injury. 7.

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Sponsoring from German, 5 years\\" correctly answer the question \\"What took Atta to Germany and how long was he there?\\"? Pick your answer from: (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"(a). no. The response \\"Sponsoring from German, 5 years\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What took Atta to Germany and how long was he there?\\" The passage states that Atta went to Germany after asking a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. This family suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there. Atta initially went to Germany in July 1992 and was still registered as a student until the fall of 1999, which is more than 5 years. Therefore, the correct answer should be that Atta went to Germany to continue his education and was there for more than 7 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: -  When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space - As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it - The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack - Clay expends when wet like ice does - This causes rock to break apart - Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock  What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process involves the combined action of physical, chemical, and biological weathering, which leads to the gradual breakdown and disintegration of rocks, ultimately contributing to the formation of soil. Upon the breaking apart of rocks due to the expansion of water upon freezing and the swelling of clay, as well as the growth of plants like mosses and lichens on bare rock, the surface area of the rock is further exposed to various weathering agents. As a result, physical weathering, such as freeze-thaw cycles, continues to weaken and expand existing cracks in the rock, further disintegrating it over time. Additionally, various other weathering processes contribute to the breakdown of rocks. Chemical weathering takes place when minerals within the rocks chemically react with elements in the environment, such as water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. This may lead to the dissolution of minerals, oxidation, or the formation of new, weaker minerals, such as clay, that are more susceptible to erosion. Biological weathering plays a significant role, too. The initial growth of mosses and lichens on bare rock creates a more favorable environment for other plant species to take root. As these plants grow and expand, their roots penetrate deeper into the cracks and crevices of the rock, exerting pressure that further weakens the rock structure. Additionally, microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, contribute to the chemical weathering by producing acids that react with the minerals in the rock. As these physical, chemical, and biological weathering processes continue, rock particles are gradually broken down into smaller fragments. Over time, these fragments accumulate and mix with decaying organic matter, such as dead leaves, plant roots, and microorganisms. This mixture eventually develops into soil, providing a nutrient-rich medium for plant growth and supporting a diverse ecosystem. In conclusion, the last step in this process involves the continuous weathering of rocks through the combined action of physical, chemical, and biological processes, eventually leading to the formation of soil and supporting the growth of various plant species, thus contributing to the overall development and sustenance of ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: what distance the canyon is set? Movie plot title: One-Eyed Jacks Movie plot: Rio (Marlon Brando) (also called \\"The Kid\\"), his mentor Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), and a third man called Doc rob a bank of two saddlebags of gold in Sonora, Mexico. The robbery is successful, but Mexican Rurales track them and catch them celebrating in a cantina, killing Doc. Dad and Rio manage to escape. After getting cornered on a high ridge, with Rio's horse dead, Rio figures the Rurales will be \\"swarming all over us inside an hour.\\" Deciding that one partner might take the remaining pony, ride to a jacalito down the canyon about five miles and return with fresh mounts, they gamble for it, with Rio fixing the deal so his pal Dad can be the one to go. Dad gets to a corral, strapping the swag bag onto a fresh pony, but he gets second thoughts. He casts one eye towards a point on the ridge sure to be taken by the Rurales, and with the other he gazes off in the opposite direction out past a low-lying treeline towards the border and safety. One way leads to danger and a poor chance at surviving with half the booty, the other towards a virtual certainty with all of it. After a decidedly short moment of reflection, he leaves his friend to be taken by Rurales. Rio is arrested and transported to prison by way of the jacalito, where he learns firsthand of Dad's betrayal from the owner. Rio spends five hard years in a Sonora prison, giving him ample time to mull over Dad's betrayal before escaping with new partner Chico Modesto (Larry Duran) and going hunting for him. When he locates him, Longworth has used his wealth to become the sheriff of Monterey, California. Instead of ambushing Dad, Rio gives him a chance to explain why he left him back in Mexico, pretending he had never been captured to put him off-guard. Longworth's awkward self-serving story is easily seen through. All along Rio planned not only to kill Dad, but to pull off a bank robbery in Monterey with his new partners Chico and \\"scum-suckin' pig\\" Bob Emory (Ben Johnson) (who used his knowledge of Dad's whereabouts to force their partnership). Plans...

The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

Matthew Macklin was sore, obviously heartbroken, but gracious in defeat. A thunderous right hook from Jorge Sebastien Heiland of Argentina had knocked him out in the 10th round of their WBC world middleweight title eliminator at the 3 Arena on Saturday night. He is now left with the unappealing and likely decision to retire without winning a world title. A student of boxing, he pointed out fighters who had numerous title shots before reaching the summit but also name-checked legends of the sport who fought because they were fighters. He deserves access to that club. ‘Look at the [Jake] LaMottas and all them — they lost many, many times and still went on and won a world title,’ said Macklin in his dressing-room after the fight. ‘How many footballers have bad games? It’s just in boxing you’re as good as your last fight. Matthew Macklin could be nearing retirement after suffering a devastating defeat in Dublin. ‘It’s a shame because now the world title looks further away and maybe it’s just not to be for me. Maybe that fight in Germany will haunt me forever.’ That fight in Germany was a reference to his 2011 points loss to Felix Sturm in Cologne in a WBA world-title fight. He was awarded the decision by German TV pundits that night, but the judges, bafflingly, awarded the win to Sturm. In hindsight, it was his best opportunity to win a world title, despite the fact that he went on to headline at Madison Square Garden against Sergio Martinez and later challenged pound-for-pound monster Gennady Golovkin.

Macklin was stopped by Jorge Sebastien Heiland in the 10th round of their WBC world title eliminator. Heiland and Macklin went toe to toe for 10 rounds. After a clean left hand landed on Macklin’s chin, that right hook from Heiland left the home fighter on the canvas 42 seconds into the round. In truth, the Birmingham-born Tipperary man looked every inch of his 32 years from the third round on and the aggregate damage of a pro career which started in his teens made him look, for the first time, a very tired fighter. ‘He was decent and I knew he was good,’ said Macklin of Heiland afterwards. ‘No one wants to admit they’re getting older but the pace of the fight… it probably suited him more than me.’ A constantly busy 27-year-old Heiland was too much to deal with. Argentine Heiland celebrates victory over Macklin in Dublin on Saturday night. ‘I’ve got the sort of face where I show every emotion anyway, so I looked tired after a round!” laughed Macklin afterwards, but the 32-year-old is now, undoubtedly, considering retirement. ‘I’ve had tough fights, tough spars and lived in f***ing hotel rooms all over the world! It’s a tough-ish life, but I’ve had more highs than lows, definitely.... I’ll just have to see.’ The unusual predicament Macklin finds will finds himself in is whether to fight on considering there is a possibility that he could yet book an All-Ireland showdown with Limerick’s Lee or a date with England’s Martin Murray. Promoter Eddie Hearn pinpointed Dublin middleweight Luke Keeler as a star in the making after the 27-year-old demolished Gary Boulden in one round, while he hinted that Cork’s Gary ‘Spike’ O’Sullivan could yet become a major player in the 160lb division after he battered Anthony Fitzgerald inside two minutes. Former amateur stars John Joe Nevin and Tommy McCarthy both recorded early stoppage wins. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

What is the answer: Santorini is part of which country?","output":"Santorini is a beautiful and picturesque island that belongs to the country of Greece. Greece, officially known as the Hellenic Republic, is a southeastern European nation comprised of a mainland and a vast number of islands. Santorini, which is often considered one of Greece's most popular and iconic destinations, is part of the Cyclades group of islands that can be found in the Aegean Sea. Santorini, also known as Thira, is renowned for its stunning sunsets, volcanic caldera, whitewashed buildings, blue-domed churches, and breathtaking views. The island has a unique crescent shape, which was formed due to a massive volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 3,600 years ago. This eruption resulted in the creation of the island's famous caldera, a depression encircling the archipelago. Tourism is a significant contributor to Santorini's economy, and the island offers a variety of activities and points of interest for visitors. Some of the highlights include the picturesque villages of Fira and Oia, the ancient city of Akrotiri, wine tours, and exploring the island's volcanic beaches, such as the Red Beach and the Black Beach. Visitors can also take a boat tour to the volcanic islands of Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni, where they can hike and even swim in natural hot springs. Santorini's cuisine is influenced by the island's unique geography and long history. Local dishes showcase the flavors and ingredients of the Mediterranean, and visitors can savor delicacies such as fava beans, cherry tomatoes, and white eggplants, all of which are grown on the island. Additionally, Santorini is celebrated for producing exceptional wines, particularly the much-loved Assyrtiko, a white grape variety that thrives in the island's volcanic soil. In Greek mythology, Santorini is associated with Atlantis, the legendary sunken city. The catastrophic eruption that shaped the island's geography is believed by some to have been the source of Plato’s account of the doomed civilization. While the association between Santorini and Atlantis remains speculative, the island undoubtedly possesses a captivating charm and history that attract visitors from all around the world. In conclusion, Santorini is a beautiful, volcanic island located in the southeastern European nation of Greece. As part of the Cyclades group of islands in the Aegean Sea, it offers an array of activities, attractions, and rich history that make it a popular tourist destination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is easy to sing hosannas for Max Verstappen, the boy who will make his Formula One debut for Toro Rosso next year at 17 years of age, becoming the youngest driver in the sport’s history. He is a talented driver by all accounts and appeared precociously assured before the assembled media in the paddock in Spa this weekend. Many fellow racers here have given him a generous welcome to the most exclusive drivers’ club in the world. Here is Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, speaking self-deprecatingly about Verstappen, son of Jos, the Dutch driver of the 1990s and early 2000s. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Who is 16 year old F1 driver Max Verstappen? Ready for the challenge? Max Verstappen, 16, will become the youngest driver in the history of Formula One at 17 years old when he joins the Scuderia Toro Rosso team next season. Centre of attention: Verstappen was composed during his first press conference at Spa in Belgium this week after being announced as Toro Rosso's new driver. ‘I don’t know Max at all,’ said Button. ‘I knew his father because I raced against him, as did Fernando (Alonso) and Kimi (Raikkonen), I think. Somebody obviously thinks he’s ready for Formula One because they have given him the opportunity. ‘I got my drive with Williams when I was 19 years old. I wasn’t ready for Formula One. I was ready when I was 23. But I took the opportunity because it might not come again. Frank (Williams) phoned me up – I was in the pub with my mates having a pint of beer – and said, “Do you think you are ready for Formula One?” I said: “Definitely not”. He said: “OK, right, thank you.” ‘I put the phone down and phoned my dad and he said, “You’re kidding me!” He said: “phone him back and tell him you are.” So I called him back and said I was ready. Frank invited me to the factory and that’s how it all started – I got the test and got the drive. 'For anyone who comes into the sport and is given the opportunity, as a driver, a dad or a manager, you have to take it. Whether Max is ready, nobody knows.’ Ready or not: Jenson Button admitted he wasn't ready for the challenges of Formula One until the age of 23. Pedigree: Verstappen on the podium during an FIA Formula 3 European Championship race at Silverstone. Button was being very fair. He raised doubts about the suitability of a 17-year-old – which will make him two years younger than the youngest previous driver, Jaime Alguersuari – but cautioned us against judging Verstappen by his own standards between the age of 19 and 23. Jacques Villeneuve, a former team-mate of the young Button at BAR Honda, was less sympathetic towards the experiment. The 1997 world champion, who made his F1 debut aged 24, said: ‘Basically, it’s like getting all the presents without deserving anything. But there is this thing of “the younger, the better”. What's the next step? A team who will sign someone at 15 just to get the image out of it? ‘It is the wrong way round. Caesar and Napoleon were good from the beginning but it takes time before you become an emperor. You build it. ‘He is still a boy so it is very risky. You don’t take a 16-year-old, who hasn’t even been to university, into the best hospital as a doctor, even if he is very good and very intelligent. Sceptical: Former world champion Jacques Villeneuve (left), seen here with Verstappen (right) and his father Jos, said Toro Rosso's appointment represented a big risk. Number one: Verstappen celebrates after winning the Zandvoort Masters of Formula 3 race last month. ‘You need to pay dues. You need to deserve it because that is only how you will become a man.’ Speaking to Autosport, Villeneuve added: ‘Getting a Super Licence (a prerequisite for Formula One) should be meaningful – not just doing three hundred kilometres and it being fine.’ I tend to agree with many of Villeneuve’s observations. Formula One should be the pinnacle; the final logical step in a career through various formulas. That a boy who only started racing cars this year, in Formula Three, can be deemed able to drive in Formula One may reveal how easy it is – in comparison to years gone by – to drive these cars. When Susie Wolff, of Williams, stepped in to test earlier this season, she was alarmingly close to the team’s regular race driver Felipe Massa on the timesheets, and, by all accounts, she is hardly Stirling Moss. But more than anything I hope Max is not burned in the exercise. Being a former Formula One racer while still in his teens would be an unwelcome conclusion to an astonishingly youthful beginning. Bernie Charles Ecclestone, 83 years old, is back in command behind the opaque glass – from the outside that is – of his portable HQ. I suspect the underground movement that pressed for change in their longed-for post-Bernie era will fall silent again now that he is not going to jail for bribery. It was always thus in Formula One. Back in charge: Bernie Ecclestone talks to reporters at Spa in advance of the Belgian Grand Prix. He is once again able to concentrate his energies fully on Formula One following the end of his bribery trial in Germany. One senior paddock figure told me that he would like to excise the whole current crop of drivers. They are, he thought, too highly trained in the dark, spin-doctoring wiles of saying nothing interesting. This view is not entirely misplaced. Nico Rosberg, for example, was coy despite being angry with Lewis Hamilton for not moving over as instructed during the last race in Hungary. Perhaps he was being smart, but some former drivers would have given vent to their feelings. Or, to put it another way, told it how it was. Ditto with Marussia’s Max Chilton and the curious issue of whether he would race this weekend in Belgium. He provided no explanation for his reinstatement a day after announcing he would sit out the grand prix. However, we journalists are not entirely blame-free in all this obfuscation. We criticise people for small slips of the tongue. They clam up more. The relationship between press and participant worsens. It is a vicious circle. Guarded: Nico Rosberg had little to say on Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes team orders in his press conference ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses Max Verstappen's debut in Formula One at the age of 17, making him the youngest driver in the sport's history. Many fellow racers and world champions, such as Jenson Button and Jacques Villeneuve, have shared their opinions on whether Verstappen is ready for the challenges of F1. Button was fair in his assessment, saying that he himself wasn't ready for F1 until the age of 23, while Villeneuve expressed concern about the risk involved in hiring such a young driver.

The disorder may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of dying early, according to new research presented today at an annual meeting of the American Heart Association. The study included about 286,000 mostly male veterans between the ages of 45 and 81 who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and conflicts dating back to the Korean War. The vets with PTSD -- who accounted for roughly 10 percent of the study participants -- had more than double the risk of dying during the 10-year study compared to their peers who didn't have disorder, the researchers found. Health.com: Depression, PTSD common among Iraq vets. Twenty-nine percent of the vets with PTSD died during the study, compared to 8 percent of the vets without PTSD. (The overall death rate in the study was 13 percent.) The increased risk of death associated with PTSD held even after the researchers controlled for factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. A separate analysis involving heart scans from 637 of the veterans found that men and women with PTSD had more calcium buildup in their arteries than vets without post-traumatic stress. Calcium buildup is a hallmark of atherosclerosis (also known as hardening of the arteries), which can lead to heart attacks. Health.com: Surprising heart attack risks. Among veterans with similar degrees of calcium buildup, those who had PTSD were 48 percent more likely to die of any cause during the study and 41 percent more likely to die from heart disease compared to those without PTSD, according to the study, which was led by Naser Ahmadi, MD, a cardiologist at the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center. \\"If a vet has PTSD, they need to be under surveillance for cardiovascular disease as they age,\\" says Joseph Boscarino, PhD, a senior investigator at Geisinger Center for Health Research, in Danville, Pennsylvania., and an expert on the link between post-traumatic stress and physical illness. Boscarino did not participate in the new study. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after exposure to a traumatic event, including sexual abuse and military combat. People with the condition experience recurring, intrusive memories about the event, and may also experience emotional numbness and detachment. Health.com: Traumatized? Playing Tetris may reduce flashbacks. Previous studies have linked PTSD to a greater risk of death and heart disease, but the new study is the first to explore what's behind the relationship. The explanation is likely complicated, says Laura Kubzansky, PhD, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston. Inflammation stemming from constant stress may be involved, she says, but other factors or unhealthy behaviors -- such as not getting enough exercise -- may be partly responsible as well. \\"People with PTSD are trying to make themselves feel better in lots of different ways,\\" says Kubzansky, who didn't take part in Dr. Ahmadi's study. Behaviors such as smoking \\"clearly contribute, but there's something else going on.\\" It's not clear from the study whether treating PTSD can lower a person's risk of atherosclerosis or heart disease. Still, Dr. Ahmadi says that PTSD should be treated using effective techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, preferably as soon as possible after the traumatic event. \\"If you don't treat PTSD, it's like a vicious cycle,\\" he says. Health.com: Can Ecstasy help ease post-traumatic stress? Boscarino says that thousands of veterans have contacted him to ask whether they can make disability claims for heart disease and post-traumatic stress to the Veterans Administration. \\"The veteran community is very frustrated right now because they can't get a ruling on this [from the VA],\\" he says. \\"They have to fight each case over and over again, which is not the case for Agent Orange...or other military disability exposures.\\" Dr. Ahmadi presented his findings at the American Heart Association's annual Scientific Sessions meeting, which highlights the latest heart-related research and treatment advances. Unlike studies published in medical journals, the research presented at the meeting has not been vetted by independent experts in the field. Copyright Health Magazine 2011.

OPTIONS: A. no; B. yes;","output":"A. no The two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question asks for information about the most educated Indian politician ever. In contrast, the second question inquiries about why most Indian politicians are uneducated. Therefore, the correct answer is A. no. To answer the first question, there is no definitive \\"most educated Indian politician\\" as there are several politicians in India who have impressive educational backgrounds. However, some notable examples of highly educated Indian politicians include: 1. Dr. Manmohan Singh - Dr. Singh served as the Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He has degrees in Economics from three universities: Panjab University, Cambridge University, and Oxford University. Additionally, he has served in various prominent international organizations, such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. 2. Shashi Tharoor - Tharoor is an accomplished author, diplomat, and politician. He has held various positions within the Indian National Congress and in the Parliament, representing Thiruvananthapuram. He holds a Bachelor's degree in History from St. Stephen's College, Delhi University, and two Master's degrees and a Ph.D. from Tufts University, the United States. 3. Dr. Subramanian Swamy - A prominent leader from the Bharatiya Janata Party, Dr. Swamy has a Bachelor's degree from the University of Delhi, a Master's degree from the Indian Statistical Institute, and a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University. Now, to answer the second question, it is important to recognize that not all Indian politicians are uneducated. Nevertheless, there are several factors contributing to the perception that many Indian politicians are uneducated, including: 1. The political environment - Political systems in India often prioritize loyalty, dynastic politics, and other factors unrelated to educational qualifications as criteria for political success. 2. Education and politics - Many politicians come from a variety of backgrounds and, as they may have entered politics at a young age, they might not have had the opportunity to pursue higher education. As such, politics becomes a viable career option for those without formal educational qualifications. 3. Lack of regulations - There is no minimum educational requirement to be elected into Indian political offices. As a result, many politicians may have little formal education. 4. Representation - In a diverse democracy like India, it is essential that the political representatives come from various backgrounds, including those with limited formal education. This allows for a broader range of perspectives and better representation in the decision-making process. In conclusion, it is crucial to note that while there are cases of highly educated Indian politicians, several factors contribute to the perception of \\"uneducated\\" politicians in India. However, both questions are not the same in meaning as they inquire about different aspects of Indian politicians and their education."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Finally, late on the night before the match, he could hold himself back no longer. \\"Dad, I haven't got any proper football boots ...\\" he said. \\"Ah,\\" said Dad, \\"I might be able to help you there.\\" At the words, Joe was excited. New boots! He thought. \\"He's got me some new boots! He must have got me them for Christmas,\\" thought Joe, \\"But now that I'm in an important match, he's giving them to me early. Wonderful!\\" Dad went upstairs. Joe excitedly tried to watch the football preview on TV. He wasn't playing for Manchester United or Liverpool, of course, but he was part of it all now; part of the thrill. His legs twitched with every kick on the screen. His head shook with every centre. And all the time, his mind was racing ahead to his own great game the next morning, in his super new boots. It was ages before his dad came downstairs again. He put a large pair of shiny black boots in front of Joe. As he stared at them, the boy felt as if someone had poured ice into his brain. The boots were awful! \\"Good, eh?\\" said his dad. Joe found it hard to speak. He had never seen anything like them before. They weren't low-cut, soft or.... They had big, hard square toes, great big long studs and they were high at the ankle. They were his dad's old rugby boots, polished up. Joe was filled with disappointment. They had been good boots, quality boots. And they were his size. Joe's feet were enormous for his age.

It is named after the River Exe, the source of which is situated in the centre of the area, two miles north-west of Simonsbath. Exmoor is more precisely defined as the area of the former ancient royal hunting forest, also called Exmoor, which was officially surveyed 18151818 as in extent. The moor has given its name to a National Park, which includes the Brendon Hills, the East Lyn Valley, the Vale of Porlock and of the Bristol Channel coast. The total area of the Exmoor National Park is , of which 71% is in Somerset and 29% in Devon.  - Minehead is a coastal town and civil parish in Somerset, England. It lies on the south bank of the Bristol Channel, north-west of the county town of Taunton, from the border with the county of Devon and in proximity of the Exmoor National Park. The parish of Minehead has a population of approximately 11,981 making it the most populous town in the West Somerset local government district. This figure includes Alcombe and Woodcombe, suburban villages which have been subsumed into Minehead.  - Rolling is a type of motion that combines rotation (commonly, of an axially symmetric object) and translation of that object with respect to a surface (either one or the other moves), such that, if ideal conditions exist, the two are in contact with each other without sliding.  - The Norman conquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later styled as William the Conqueror.  - Gloucestershire (; abbreviated Glos.) is a county in South West England. The county comprises part of the Cotswold Hills, part of the flat fertile valley of the River Severn, and the entire Forest of Dean.  - Dunster is a village, civil parish and former manor within the English county of Somerset, today just within the north-eastern boundary of the Exmoor National Park. It lies on the Bristol Channel coast south-southeast of Minehead and northwest of Taunton. The United Kingdom Census of 2011 recorded a parish population of 817.  - Taunton is the county town of Somerset, England. The built up area of the town had a population of 64,621 in 2011.  - Dorset (or archaically, Dorsetshire) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast. The ceremonial county comprises the non-metropolitan county, which is governed by Dorset County Council, and the unitary authority areas of Poole and Bournemouth. Covering an area of , Dorset borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The county town is Dorchester which is in the south. After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density.  - A hammermill is a mill whose purpose is to shred or crush aggregate material into smaller pieces by the repeated blows of little hammers. These machines have many sorts of applications in many industries, including:  - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - The Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1154, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a succession crisis precipitated by the accidental death of William Adelin, the only legitimate son of Henry I, in 1120. Henry's attempts to install his daughter, the Empress Matilda, as his successor were unsuccessful and on Henry's death in 1135, his nephew Stephen of Blois seized the throne with the help of another nephew, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester. Stephen's early reign was marked by fierce fighting with English barons, rebellious Welsh leaders and Scottish invaders. Following a major rebellion in the south-west of England, Matilda invaded in 1139 with the help of her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester.  - Dunster Working Watermill ( also known as Castle Mill ) is a restored 18th century watermill , situated on the River Avill , close to Gallox Bridge , in the grounds of Dunster Castle in Dunster , Somerset , England . It is a Grade II * listed building . The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book , but the present building was constructed around 1780 . It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour . The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels . It is owned by the National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company .  - Somerset is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales. Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon. Somerset's county town is Taunton.  - A shell keep is a style of medieval fortification, best described as a stone structure circling the top of a motte.  - Dunster Castle is a former motte and bailey castle, now a country house, in the village of Dunster, Somerset, England. The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor, and has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century.  - A textile or cloth is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread). Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, or other material to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting.  - A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber. Prior to the invention of the sawmill, boards were rived (split) and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.  - A hammer is a tool or device that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. Most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes.  - Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.  - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million.  - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England.  - A metal (from Greek  \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable  that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking  as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.  - A paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp, old rags and other ingredients using a Fourdrinier machine or other type of paper machine.  - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy.  - The River Avill is a small river on Exmoor in Somerset, England.  - A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work.  - Wiltshire (or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was Wilton but Wiltshire Council is now based in the new county town of Trowbridge.  - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point.  - A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load.  - A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on.  - Lumber (American English; used only in North America), or timber (used in the rest of the English speaking world) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber may also refer to currently un-needed furniture, as in Lumber room, or an awkward gait, ultimately derived from the look of unfashionable and unwanted furniture.  - A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. The wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel.  - Wire drawing is a metalworking process used to reduce the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, but it may be performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, and a number of industrial and construction processes.

In sociology, emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In anthropology, the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of communication sciences, critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to Arlie Russell Hochschild's concept of emotional labor. The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet, an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The given sentence \\"Ко мне все относились по семейному, как дома.\\" translates into English as \\"Everyone treated me like family, like at home.\\" This sentence is indicative of a warm, hospitable environment where the speaker feels as accepted and comfortable as they would within their own family or home. The phrase \\"Ко мне все относились по семейному\\" directly translates to \\"Everyone treated me like family\\". Here, the verb относились (treated) is used in the context to denote the behaviour or attitude expressed towards the speaker by those around them. \\"По семейному\\" literally translates to \\"like family\\" suggesting a sense of familiarity, warmth, and affection the people showed towards the speaker. The phrase \\"как дома\\", directly translates to \\"like at home\\". This suggests a level of comfort and ease that one would generally associate with their own home. It conveys a sense of belonging and acceptance that the speaker felt in this environment.  When combined, these two phrases suggest the speaker felt thoroughly accepted and was treated with a level of warmth and closeness that they usually associate with their family or home.

Definition: Given a pair of words, generate the relation between them. The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random. Input: Concept: whale, Relatum: food.

Whale: a large marine mammal with a streamlined hairless body, a horizontal tail fin, and a blowhole on top of the head for breathing. Food: any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth. Now let's consider each category: 1. Co-hyponym (coordinate): As whale and food do not belong to the same semantic class, they don't have a coordinate relation. 2. Hypernym: Food is not a category that includes whale as a specific instance, so it's not a hypernym. 3. Meronym: Food is not a part/component/organ/member of a whale, so it's not a meronym relation. 4. Attribute: Since food is not an adjective that describes an attribute of a whale, it's not an attribute relation. 5. Event: Food is not a verb about an action involving a whale, so it's not an event relation. None of the above categories fit the relation between \\"whale\\" and \\"food.\\" Therefore: Output: random"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her. Three years later, Donald Bohana was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, according to People magazine.

The speaker emphasizes their belief that the actions being taken or the plan being discussed will have a positive impact on the citizens of Moldova. This optimistic statement shows confidence in the approach and suggests that living conditions, economic opportunities, or general well-being of the people in the country will see notable improvements. Moldova, a small landlocked country located in Eastern Europe, has faced economic and political challenges since gaining independence in 1991. The country has been making strides in recent years to improve the quality of life for its citizens, such as through reforms, social programs, and infrastructure development. However, it's essential to continue working on viable solutions that will contribute to the country's progress and secure a better future for the Moldovan people. One way to improve the lives of the Moldovan people is to strengthen the nation's economy. Investing in education, promoting entrepreneurship, and supporting local industries can help citizens build sustainable livelihoods, reduce poverty, and contribute to the nation's overall economic growth. Another essential aspect of improving the lives of Moldova's citizens is ensuring access to quality healthcare services. This includes investing in modern facilities, medical equipment, and skilled professionals, which will help to promote healthier lifestyles and improve overall well-being. Improving infrastructure is another critical factor in enhancing the lives of the Moldovan people. This includes updating transportation networks, such as roads, railways, and public transportation, as well as improving access to essential utilities like water, electricity, and sanitation services. Political stability and good governance are also crucial for Moldova's development. Removing corruption, promoting transparency, and ensuring that all citizens have a voice in the decision-making process will help to foster sustainable growth and improvements in living standards.

Why does Trump shape his fingers like a vagina during his speeches? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information, specifically, regarding the gestures made by former President Donald Trump during his speeches. To provide a detailed answer: While it is not accurate to say that former President Donald Trump intentionally shapes his fingers to resemble a specific body part, it is true that he frequently uses particular hand gestures during his speeches. One of the most common gestures he employs is the \\"OK\\" gesture (forming a circle with his thumb and index finger, with the other three fingers extended). This gesture is sometimes interpreted as mimicking the shape of a vagina, though this interpretation is subjective. Understanding why Trump utilizes this gesture requires an examination of his communication style and body language. The use of hand gestures in communication helps individuals emphasize points, convey emotions, and establish a connection with their audience. Trump is widely known for his expressive and animated speaking style, which often includes various gestures that can convey confidence, dominance, and emphasis on critical points. The specific gesture in question, the \\"OK\\" gesture, has been used by speakers throughout history for various reasons. In Trump's case, it appears to be a way for him to stress important concepts and to demonstrate precision, as the circular shape formed by the fingers may symbolize the notion of \\"zeroing\\" in on something. Additionally, the extended three fingers can signify that the speaker is making a point or demonstrating a general sense of assertiveness. It is important to consider that Trump's use of this gesture has likely been influenced by cultural factors and the way he has developed his communication style over the years. People tend to adopt certain habits and behaviors without being consciously aware of them. Therefore, it is unlikely that Trump deliberately shapes his fingers in that specific manner to convey a hidden meaning. Instead, it may simply be an aspect of his natural speaking style and a result of his learned behaviors. In conclusion, the hand gesture made by former President Donald Trump during his speeches – the \\"OK\\" gesture – is not intentionally meant to resemble a specific body part. Instead, it is a means of emphasizing key points and demonstrating assertiveness, precision, and confidence. The interpretation of this gesture varies, but its purpose is rooted in communication and body language rather than any hidden meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

Plot title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has...

The relay was initially supposed to cover 28 km, but it was shortened at the demand of Chinese officials following widespread protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists, who repeatedly attempted to disrupt, hinder or halt the procession. A scheduled ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes.

An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests.

This was later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing the torch.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go.

Question: What does the destruction of the red spire represent Movie plot title: Superman II Movie plot: Prior to the destruction of Krypton, the criminals General Zod, Ursa and Non disable a security guard at a crystalline matrix table. The general removes a red spire from the table and destroys it; the thunderclap as the piece is shattered resonates through the city and sets off a trap that ensnares the three brigands. The red spire's destruction is clearly an act of treason, and for this and other crimes they are sentenced by Jor-El for banishment into the Phantom Zone.Many years after traveling through the galaxy, the Phantom Zone is shattered near Earth by the shockwave from the harmless detonation of a hydrogen bomb launched into space by Superman. The three criminals are freed, finding themselves with super powers granted by the yellow light of Earth's sun. After attacking human astronauts on the moon and the small town of East Houston, Idaho, the three travel to the White House and force the President of the United States to surrender to Zod (on behalf of the entire planet) during an international television broadcast. When the President warns Zod that Superman will stop them, Zod announces his demand for Superman to come and \\"kneel before Zod!\\"Prior to Zod's arrival, Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent on assignment for the Daily Planet to Niagara Falls. Lois becomes suspicious that Clark is Superman and tries to lure him into revealing his identity by throwing herself into the Falls, but Clark manages to save her with subtle use of his powers. That night, Clark accidentally reaches into the room's fireplace to recover his glasses after he trips; when Lois discovers his hand is not even burnt, Clark is forced to admit he is Superman. He takes her to his Fortress of Solitude near the North Pole and shows her the traces of his past stored in the energy crystals of the Fortress, one of which is the green crystal that created the Fortress and opened Superman's contact with his long-deceased parents.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who named their fake child Cyrus?, using the article: Patsy Douglas comes up with an ingenious way to get a seat on the crowded New York subway: she pretends to have a baby, using a doll discarded by the advertising agency where she works. One day, however, her agency's primary client, short-tempered Cyrus Baxter, happens to be seated beside her. (His chauffeur had abruptly quit after Baxter berated him for getting stuck in a traffic jam.) He is delighted when he overhears that she named her \\"child\\" Cyrus after him. He becomes acquainted with her, letting her assume that he works for Baxter as a watchman. Later, when the agency's two bosses, Sam Morley and Barry Holmes see Baxter to try to get him to sign a contract for a new advertising campaign, he insists they keep her happy, to their puzzlement. Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter's mistress. Patsy discovers her new friend's identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea. Meanwhile, Baxter's temper improves under Patsy's influence. When Morley and Holmes finally learn the truth, Patsy wants to confess all to Baxter, but they insist she carry on the masquerade until they get his signature on the contract. She reluctantly agrees, after they point out that they will probably have to close if they do not get Baxter's business, throwing hundreds out of work. When Morley shows Baxter a photograph of the baby (actually a picture of his partner as a child), Baxter notices a resemblance to Holmes and assumes he is the father. To placate him, Morley arranges for Holmes to start dating Patsy. In the process, however, he becomes jealous, having fallen in love without realizing it., what would be the answer ?

Summarize: After Wayne Madsen had hit exactly 100, his sixth Championship ton of the summer, first-innings centurion Harvey Hosein got to 59 to take his total of runs in the match to 167 at New Road. But the visitors lost their last five wickets for 11 runs to collapse to 266. Worcestershire then took 9.4 overs to reach their target on 40-1 - their third Championship win in four matches. After resuming on 15-1, Madsen and Hosein looked to have taken the prospect of victory out of Worcestershire's reach with a fifth-wicket stand of 124, before Hosein's 57-run stand with Tom Milnes (36). But home skipper Daryl Mitchell put himself on and took two wickets in successive overs to get rid of Milnes and debutant Greg Cork. Spinner Brett D'Oliveira then removed Hosein and Will Davis in the space of two deliveries before Miguel Cummins had Tony Palladino leg before. Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester: \\"A lot of the crowd went home because they anticipated the game fizzling out. \\"At tea five wickets sounds a lot to get but we lost five for five at Hove. We reminded the players of that at tea because they were pretty tired after two days out there in the field. \\"You can never predict what happens in cricket but Daryl Mitchell came on, got a couple of wickets and we finished them off. It was nice to end with another win.\\" Derbyshire captain Billy Godleman told BBC Radio Derby: \\"The guys battled very hard. Harvey Hosein and Wayne Madsen played magnificently again but the top order were not able to take enough time out of the game in the second innings. \\"It's obviously been a new-ball wicket. It's been the pattern of the game. Most games of cricket are.

Article: The 30 miles of steep roads that snake through the mountains of Logan Canyon in Utah are enough to make most drivers'hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear River Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Canyon hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine-but the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became. Rounding a sharp U-turn at mile marker473, Andersen saw a truck that had skated off the road and immediately tapped his brakes. In an instant, the car was sliding at 25 miles per hour toward the shoulder of the highway, then rolling down a steep ten-foot dam toward the extremely cold Logan River. As it hit the water, the car tipped toward the passenger side, hesitated, and then rolled onto its roof and sank into the river. There was no time to tell the kids what to do. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the upside-down car was filled with water. \\"It was frightening how fast we were completely underwater,\\"remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken product development manager.\\"You're thinking, is this how it's all going to end?\\" Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids. Mia had been right next to him in the front seat; now, in the blackness, he couldn't find her.\\"I thought, if I don't get out, maybe none of us are going to get out.\\" Andersen got out of his seat belt, swam through a broken window, and, deeply and quickly, breathed air at the surface. That's when he saw a group of men, about ten in all, appear at the top of the dam. One after another, they raced down into the water. Helping onto safety all the three children, they began to shout at the father,\\"Who else is in the car?\\"Andersen says respectfully,\\" _  .\\" Question: Andersen didn't expect any trouble on the road because  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"he was familiar with the road\\"? A:","output":"Yes, Andersen didn't expect any trouble on the road because he was familiar with the road. As mentioned in the article, Andersen has driven through the Logan Canyon hundreds of times over the years, which gave him a sense of confidence and familiarity with the route. The 30 miles of steep roads and mountainous terrain were nothing new to him, and the fine weather on that day further strengthened his confidence in a trouble-free journey. However, unexpected circumstances led to their car sliding off the road and into the Logan River. The fact that he had not anticipated any problems on the journey only highlights the unpredictability of nature and how caution should always be exercised even on familiar routes. The 46-year-old father of four found himself in a dire situation, with his car submerged in the freezing river and his children's lives at stake. Despite being familiar with the road and having driven it many times, accidents can still occur and catching anybody off-guard. In this case, his familiarity with the road may have given him a false sense of security. In conclusion, Andersen's familiarity with the road did not protect him and his passengers from encountering an unexpected and life-threatening event. Overall safety on the road depends on various factors, including weather conditions, attentiveness, and proper vehicle maintenance. Even the most experienced drivers may find themselves facing unforeseen circumstances, emphasizing the importance of always being prepared and cautious."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? rashomon-for-dipsticks","output":"In order to determine the sentiment of the given phrase, \\"rashomon-for-dipsticks,\\" we must first analyze its parts and discern its intended meaning. The phrase combines two separate concepts: \\"Rashomon\\" and \\"dipsticks.\\" \\"Rashomon\\" refers to a 1950 Japanese movie directed by Akira Kurosawa. The film is celebrated for its unique narrative technique where different characters recount their perspectives on the same event. The term \\"Rashomon effect\\" has since been derived to describe situations where people interpret the same event in contrasting ways due to subjective perceptions. Generally, the context of Rashomon indicates an intricate, thought-provoking story that explores the complexities of human nature. On the other hand, \\"dipsticks\\" is a slang term, often used in a derogatory manner, referring to someone who might be considered slow-witted, incompetent, or foolish. This term carries a negative connotation due to its pejorative use. With both parts analyzed, we can now examine the sentiment of the whole phrase. The combination of \\"Rashomon\\" with \\"dipsticks\\" seems to convey a negative sentiment. It suggests a simplified version of \\"Rashomon\\" catered to the perceived unintelligent or incapable audience, or it could be referring to individuals who cannot understand the deep and complex narrative of the original film and require a basic or \\"dumbed-down\\" version. This interpretation assumes a level of condescension or mockery, which ultimately points to a negative sentiment associated with the phrase \\"rashomon-for-dipsticks.\\""},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Check with your insurance company for policy details. If you are in a high-risk area for floods, you should be insured. People in other areas may choose flood insurance to protect against water damage. Sealing your basement makes it more resistant to water. Fill in cracks and spread sealant over the walls. Keep the gutters on your house clean, too. Levees and floodwalls may also be built to help hold back floodwater. Install a sump pump. When the pump senses water on the floor, it pumps it out of your home. Make sure the pump drains properly and maintain its battery-powered backup with fresh batteries. Raise up your furnace, water heater, and electric panels. They should be installed on top of blocks or set higher in the wall than normal. This will better prevent them from getting wet. Before a flood occurs, store all valuables, such as expensive rugs, appliances, and important documents, on a higher floor in your home.  Disconnect your utilities when there’s potential for a flood. Shut off the main valves and breakers. Unplug all electrical appliances unless you are standing in water.  Take care of valuables before flooding begins. You may not have time to do this once the water starts rising.","output":"Flood insurance is a crucial safeguard for homeowners and business owners, especially for those located in high-risk flood areas. It can provide significant protection and financial relief in the event of water damage. Consult with your insurance provider to obtain policy specifics and ensure appropriate coverage based on your location and risk factors. Even those not in high-risk areas may opt for flood insurance to shield against potential damages. To minimize the impact of potential flooding, consider various preventative measures. Start by sealing your basement, filling in any cracks, and applying a sealant to walls to enhance water resistance. Additionally, maintain clean gutters to facilitate proper water drainage. In areas particularly prone to flooding, levees, and floodwalls may be constructed to help contain floodwater and limit property damage. Installing a sump pump can also be beneficial as it actively removes water from your home when it detects moisture on the floor. Ensure that the pump is draining correctly and that its battery-powered backup system is functioning optimally with fresh batteries. Elevate critical appliances and utilities, such as your furnace, water heater, and electric panels, by placing them on blocks or installing them higher within the walls. This reduces the likelihood of water damage during floods. Furthermore, store valuable items like expensive rugs, appliances, and important documents on upper floors or elevated surfaces to mitigate potential losses. In anticipation of a flood, disconnect utilities by shutting off the main valves and breakers and unplugging all electrical appliances, provided you are not standing in water. Address these precautions before flooding occurs, as there may be insufficient time to do so once water levels begin to rise. Ultimately, a combination of flood insurance and these preventive strategies can provide substantial protection for your property and valuable belongings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir.  Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls.  Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.  He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow.  He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.  Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.  Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men. contains an answer for the question: Who searches the plane wreckage?, what is it ?

LE GRAND VOYAGE is a gentle miracle of a film, a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director Ismaël Ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars Nicolas Cazalé and Mohamed Majd to carry the emotional impact of the film. Ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of Katell Djian (a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters) and the musical score by Fowzi Guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys.  Reda (Nicolas Cazalé) lives with his Muslim family in Southern France, a young student with a Western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage. His elderly father (Mohamed Majd) has decided his time has come to make his Hadj to Mecca, and being unable to drive, requests the reluctant Reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation. The two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through France, into Italy, and on through Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, and Turkey to Saudi Arabia. Along the trip Reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights, but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and Reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands. On their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman (Ghina Ognianova) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by Reda, a Turkish man Mustapha (Jacky Nercessian) who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting Reda drunk in a bar and disappearing, and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons. Tensions between father and son mount: Reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps, and the father cannot comprehend Reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs. At last they reach Mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to Reda. The manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning. It has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age, between son and father, and between defiance and acceptance of religious values.  The visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects. Nicolas Cazalé is a superb actor (be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'The Grocer's Son') and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film. Another fine film from The Film Movement, this is a tender story brilliantly told. Highly recommended.  Grady Harp What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive.

Information:  - Sverker I or Sverker the Elder (Old Swedish: \\"Swærkir konongær gambli\\"), murdered 25 December 1156, was King of Sweden from about 1130 till his death.  - Västergötland, also known as West Gothland or the Latinized version Westrogothia in older literature, is one of the 25 traditional non-administrative provinces of Sweden (\\"landskap\\" in Swedish), situated in the southwest of Sweden.  - Östergötland (English exonym: East Gothland) is one of the traditional provinces of Sweden (\\"landskap\\" in Swedish) in the south of Sweden. It borders Småland, Västergötland, Närke, Södermanland and the Baltic Sea. In older English literature, one might also encounter the Latinized version, \\"Ostrogothia\\". The corresponding administrative county, Östergötland County, covers the entire province and parts of neighbouring provinces.  - Småland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in southern Sweden.  Småland borders Blekinge, Scania (Swedish: \\"Skåne\\"), Halland, Västergötland, Östergötland and the island Öland in the Baltic Sea. The name Småland literally means \\"Small Lands\\". The Latinized form \\"Smolandia\\" has been used in other languages. The highest point in Småland is Tomtabacken, at 377 metres (1,237 ft).  - The Peace of Westphalia was a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabrück and Münster, effectively ending the European wars of religion.  These treaties ended the Thirty Years' War (16181648) in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Eighty Years' War (15681648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic, with Spain formally recognizing the independence of the Dutch Republic.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - The Thirty Years' War was a series of wars in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648. It was one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history, as well as the deadliest European religious war, resulting in eight million casualties. Initially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the great powers. These states employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the FranceHabsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence. In the 17th century, religious beliefs and practices were a much larger influence on an average European than they are today. During that era, almost everyone was vested on one side of the dispute or another, which was also closely tied to people's ethnicities and loyalties, as religious beliefs affected ideas of the legitimacy of the political status of rulers.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Martin Luther (10 November 1483  18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Ödeshög Municipality (\\"Ödeshögs kommun\\") is a municipality in Östergötland County, Sweden. The seat is situated in the small town of Ödeshög.  - Old Swedish (Modern Swedish: \\"fornsvenska\\") is the name for two separate versions of the Swedish language that were spoken in the Middle Ages: Early Old Swedish (\\"Klassisk fornsvenska\\"), spoken from around 1225 until 1375, and Late Old Swedish (\\"Yngre fornsvenska\\"), spoken from 1375 until 1526.  - Alvastra Abbey was a Cistercian monastery located at Alvastra in Östergötland , Sweden . It was founded in the first half of the 12th century by a donation of land from King Sverker I of Sweden to the Cistercian Order . It was dissolved and appropriated by the Crown at the time of the Protestant Reformation .  - The Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences are a list of propositions for an academic disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg, Germany. They advance Luther's positions against what he saw as abusive practices by preachers selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers themselves or their loved ones in purgatory. In the \\"Theses\\", Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than the system of sacramental confession of the Catholic Church. He argued that indulgences lead Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they can forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discourage Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the pope, the \\"Theses\\" challenge a fourteenth-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The \\"Theses\\" are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the \\"Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences\\".  - The Baltic Sea (  ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt.  - Östergötland County (\\"Östergötlands län\\") is a county or \\"län\\" in southeastern Sweden. It has land borders with the counties of Kalmar to the southeast, Jönköping to the southwest, Örebro to the northwest, and Södermanland to the northeast. It also has a sea border with Västra Götaland to the west (across lake Vättern), and borders the Baltic Sea to the east.  - Alvastra is a small village in Ödeshög Municipality in eastern Sweden. It is known for being the seat of the Cistercian Alvastra Abbey in the Middle Ages, established in 1143 by French monks. After the Swedish Lutheran reformation in the 1530s, the monastery was demolished, never to be rebuilt.  - A schism (pronounced , or, less commonly) is a division between people, usually belonging to an organization, movement, or religious denomination. The word is most frequently applied to a split in what had previously been a single religious body, such as the EastWest Schism or the Great Western Schism. It is also used of a split within a non-religious organization or movement or, more broadly, of a separation between two or more people, be it brothers, friends, lovers, etc.  - The provinces of Sweden are historical, geographical and cultural regions. Sweden has 25 provinces and they have no administrative function, but remain historical legacies and the means of cultural identification.

It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Protestant Reformers were those theologians, churchmen and statesmen whose careers, works and actions brought about the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. Historically speaking, \\"Protestant\\" was the name given to those theologians, magnates and delegations present at the Holy Roman Imperial Diet of Speyer in 1529 who protested the revocation of the suspension, granted at a prior Diet of Speyer in 1526, of Edict of Worms of 1521, which had outlawed Martin Luther and his followers.  - Södermanland, sometimes referred to under its Latin form \\"Sudermannia\\" or \\"Sudermania\\", is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" on the south eastern coast of Sweden.

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation (from Latin \\"reformatio\\", \\"restoration, renewal\\"), was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th century Europe. Timing most commonly used for this period is from 1517 (the Ninety-five Theses are published by Martin Luther) to 1648 (Peace of Westphalia ends the Thirty Years' War).  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries.

Plot title: Sucker Punch Movie plot: In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers.

As testimonials pour in, it's clear that O'Connor's teachings and guidance have left an indelible mark on the lives he touched. O'Connor's ability to cultivate friendships among cardinals was a testament to the genuine warmth and camaraderie he brought to the table. Through his insightful advice, thoughtfulness, and never-ending support, he built connections that lasted a lifetime. These friendships, in turn, played a vital role in providing strength and encouragement within the community of cardinals, leading to a more connected and effective church. One of the many areas where O'Connor's impact was felt was in the way he advised and guided cardinals and the clergy on matters concerning the diocese. He was known for his pragmatism, creativity, and commitment to finding solutions that would benefit all parties involved. As a result, his insights were highly sought after, and his influence was felt across the diocese and beyond. Under O'Connor's guidance, the diocese flourished. He recognized and addressed the complexities of church life, drawing from his vast experience in pastoral ministry and his ability to empathize with various perspectives. By doing so, he fostered an environment of collaboration, which ultimately led to the betterment of the diocese and the lives it touched. O'Connor's friendship and insight on diocesan matters offered more than just wisdom and support; they became a catalyst for positive change within the church. Cardinals who sought his counsel continue to carry forth his wisdom, striving to maintain the legacy he left behind. As stories and memories emerge, it's evident that Cardinal John O'Connor's influence still resonates in the hearts and minds of cardinals and the wider Catholic community. His example of friendship, guidance, and dedication to the diocese has undoubtedly left a lasting impression to be celebrated for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The history of the area that now constitutes Himachal Pradesh dates back to the time when the Indus valley civilisation flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE. Tribes such as the Koilis, Halis, Dagis, Dhaugris, Dasa, Khasas, Kinnars, and Kirats inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. During the Vedic period, several small republics known as \\"Janapada\\" existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajput principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 10th century.

This produces a bolus which can be swallowed down the esophagus and into the stomach. Here it is mixed with gastric juice until it passes into the duodenum where it is mixed with a number of enzymes produced by the pancreas. Saliva also contains a catalytic enzyme called amylase which starts to act on food in the mouth. Another digestive enzyme called lingual lipase is secreted by some of the lingual papillae on the tongue and also from serous glands in the main salivary glands. Digestion is helped by the mastication of food by the teeth and also by the muscular actions of peristalsis and segmentation contractions. Gastric juice in the stomach is essential for the continuation of digestion as is the production of mucus in the stomach. Can we conclude that is the esophagus part of the digestive tract?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the esophagus is indeed a part of the digestive tract. The digestive tract, also known as the alimentary canal or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, is a continuous pathway that starts from the mouth and ends at the anus. It is responsible for breaking down the food we consume, absorbing the nutrients, and eliminating the waste products. The esophagus plays a crucial role in this process as it connects the mouth to the stomach, allowing the passage of the chewed food bolus from the mouth to the stomach for further digestion. The esophagus is a muscular tube, approximately 25 centimeters long, which runs behind the trachea (windpipe) and the heart, and in front of the spine. When food is swallowed, the process called peristalsis pushes the food down the esophagus through rhythmic, involuntary muscle contractions. At the end of the esophagus, a ring-like muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter opens to allow the food bolus to enter the stomach and then closes to prevent the stomach acid and food from flowing back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and other gastrointestinal issues. Moreover, the lining of the esophagus produces mucus that aids in lubricating the pathway for the smooth passage of food. This highlights the significance of the esophagus as an integral component of the digestive tract, working in coordination with other organs such as the mouth, teeth, tongue, stomach, and intestines to facilitate proper digestion and absorption of nutrients."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His life purpose has suddenly been decided by a force of nature greater than himself.

Q:Background: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.  Paragraph: Henry is currently writing a research paper for his biology class. The subject of the paper is abiotic stress. For his paper, he is analyzing two different forests of differing stress levels and writing about the differences seen in the environments. For the area with a low level of stress Henry chose the Narshe Forest, located near the mountains of Harkal. The area of high stress that Henry will be looking at is the Midgar forest. After choosing the two areas, Henry feels he deserves a break from his paper and goes to watch a baseball game.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the animal population be higher or lower in the Midgar forest? A:","output":"The animal population is likely to be lower in the Midgar forest, as it is described as an area with high abiotic stress. The background information states that when the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases, and ecosystems with higher abiotic stress tend to have lower biodiversity. Consequently, one can infer that the Midgar forest will likely have a lower animal population compared to the Narshe Forest, which has lower stress levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Why did Axel want Pia to return to Germany? Movie title: Walk on Water Movie plot: Eyal is an agent in Mossad, the Israeli security service. He is a hitman who targets enemies of Israel. His wife has recently committed suicide, and the agency decides that he needs to take on a less challenging assignment: to find an aging Nazi war criminal and get him \\"before God does\\". In order to track down the old man, Eyal poses as a tour guide and befriends the Nazi's adult grandchildren, Axel and Pia. Pia lives on a kibbutz, an Israeli commune. Her brother Axel visits her in order to convince Pia to return to Germany for their father's seventieth birthday. It is later revealed that Pia's estrangement with her parents began when she discovered that they were hiding her grandfather. She shares this information with Axel. Although he has a job to perform, Eyal truly befriends Axel and Pia. Axel and Pia are decent people who demonstrate that most Germans have gotten beyond the hatred that led to the Holocaust. They spend time together and Eyal enjoys himself, even if he would not openly admit so. His friendship with Axel allows him to display some humanity, letting down his tough-guy machismo. Eyal and Axel even take a mud bath by the Dead Sea, showering off together in the nude afterward. When the three are at dinner one night in a Tel Aviv restaurant, Axel speaks privately to the Palestinian waiter, Rafik, and finds out where the best club in town is. Later that evening, Axel, Pia, and Eyal arrive at the club. Eyal is shocked to discover that it is a gay club. He sees Axel dancing with Rafik and is taken aback. Eyal is initially disgusted and disappointed to discover that Axel is gay. He asks to be removed from the assignment, not attempting to hide his homophobia as the reason. His boss, Menachem, insists that Eyal finish the mission. Eyal visits Germany and comes to realize that Axel's orientation is unimportant. During the visit, Eyal defends a group of Axel's transsexual friends from attackers and, in doing so, reveals that he is fluent in German. He tells Axel that his parents were German, leaving...

Summarize: The Wire were up 22-4 at the break thanks to tries from Ben Currie, Tom Lineham, Kevin Penny and Stefan Ratchford, with Dom Manfredi replying. Free-scoring winger Manfredi completed his hat-trick with a second-half double as Wigan improved after the break. However, the visitors scored again through Ryan Atkins to seal the points. Wigan were unbeaten in 21 months on home turf in Super League before last month's defeat by Widnes, but have now lost twice this term and trail Warrington by two points. Shaun Wane's side gave a debut to Jack Higginson amid their injury concerns, and saw influential captain Sean O'Loughlin limp off at half-time with a hamstring problem. Meanwhile, Warrington gave a fine performance to cement their early title ambitions, and win their first game in five at the DW. Atkins' score was his fourth in as many games, but Warrington also lost two key personnel in Chris Sandow to a hamstring issue of his own and Rhys Evans with a shoulder problem. Warrington coach Tony Smith: \\"I couldn't care less if Wigan were going to win it, I was worried about my players. It was tough, we couldn't rotate them after losing those two players in the first half. \\"We had a number of players who shouldn't have been on there after a while with some of the knocks they took. \\"I saw the determination of the players - they weren't going to let it slip.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Humans have sewn by hand for thousands of years. It was said that the first thread was made from animal muscle and sinew . And the earliest needles were made from bones. Since those early days, many people have been involved in the process of developing a machine that could do the same thing more quickly and with greater efficiency.  Charles Wiesenthal, who was born in Germany, designed and received a patent on a double-pointed needle that eliminated the need to turn the needle around with each stitch in England in 1755. Other inventors of that time tried to develop a functional sewing machine, but each design had at least one serious imperfection.  Frenchman Barthelemy Thimonnier finally engineered a machine that really worked. However, he was nearly killed by a group of angry tailors when they burned down his garment factory. They feared that they would lose their jobs to the machine.  American inventor Elias Howe, born on July 9, 1819, was awarded a patent for a method of sewing that used thread from two different sources. Howe's machine had a needle with an eye at the point, and it used the two threads to make a special stitch called a lockstitch. However, Howe faced difficulty in finding buyers for his machines in America. In frustration, he traveled to England to try to sell his invention there. When he finally returned home, he found that dozens of manufacturers were adapting his discovery for use in their own sewing machines.  Isaac Singer, another American inventor, was also a manufacturer who made improvements to the design of sewing machines. He invented an up-and-down-motion mechanism that replaced the side-to-side machines. He also developed a foot treadle to power his machine. This improvement left the sewer's hands free. Undoubtedly, it was a huge improvement of the hand-cranked machine of the past. Soon the Singer sewing machine achieved more fame than the others for it was more practical. It could be adapted to home use and it could be bought on hire-purchase. The Singer sewing machine became the first home appliance, and the Singer company became one of the first American multinationals.  However, Singer used the same method to create a lockstitch that Howe had already patented. As a result, Howe accused him of patent infringement . Of course, Elias Howe won the court case, and Singer was ordered to pay Howe royalties . In the end, Howe became a millionaire, not by manufacturing the sewing machine, but by receiving royalty payments for his invention. 1. What was the first thread made from? 2. What about the needles?

Write a summary based on this article: When Lynne Schultz first heard that her oldest child, Scout, had been shot and killed by a Georgia Tech police officer late Saturday night, she assumed it occurred at a protest rally.      Scout, she says, was politically active in progressive causes. Scout, a brilliant student despite numerous medical issues, suffered from depression and had attempted suicide two years ago, Lynne Schultz said.      According to Georgia Tech police, Scout was seen walking toward police and ignored numerous orders to drop what appeared to be a pocket knife. Photos of the knife taken at the scene reveal the blade was not extended.      Related: Georgia Tech student dies after shooting on campus      Photos: Scene at fatal shooting of Georgia Tech student      Video of the incident showed Scout, 21, shouting “Shoot me!” to the four officers on the scene. A minute later, one of them did.      “Why didn’t they use some nonlethal force, like pepper spray or Tasers?” Lynne Schultz told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Sunday.      That’s among the questions the GBI will be asking as the state agency investigates the shooting.      A Georgia Tech student was shot by police in an incident on the campus late Saturday night. (Photos by Dalton Touchberry / www.daltontouch.com)      Police said the shooting was prompted when Scout Schultz failed to comply with their repeated commands to drop the knife.      Chris Stewart, the attorney for the student’s parents, said it appears the officer who shot Scout overreacted.      “I think (Scout) was having a mental breakdown and didn’t know what to do,” said Stewart, who wondered why nonlethal force wasn’t used. “The area was secured. There was no one around at risk.”      Scout Schultz was shot in the heart and was pronounced dead 30 minutes later at Grady Memorial Hospital, Lynne Schultz said.      Two years ago, Scout attempted suicide by hanging, the student’s mother said.      Stewart said he doesn’t believe Scout was attempting “suicide by cop.”      RELATED: How Atlanta police handle calls involving mentally ill      Scout was majoring in computer engineering and was already taking courses for a master’s degree in biomedical engineering, with plans to design biomedical devices for a living.      Scout identified as non-binary, meaning neither male nor female, Lynne Schultz said. The accepted pronoun for non-binary individuals is “they.”      Most of Scout’s stress was related to school, the student’s mother said.      “Scout was always a perfectionist,” Lynne Schultz said. “They always worried he was going to fail a test but got all A’s and only two B’s at Tech.”      “(Scout) had a lot of empathy for people, active in a lot of causes. And very smart. Scary smart, really.”      A more complete story will appear later today on myAJC.com. ||||| This collection contains content included in or referenced by the Georgia Institute of Technology's web presence.

According to the GBI, the Georgia Tech Police Department responded to a 911 call about a person with a knife and gun in the area of Eighth Street on the campus at about 11 p.m. Saturday.      Officers arrived and found Scott Schultz, 21, armed with a knife outside a Georgia Tech dormitory.      Schultz was not cooperative and would not comply with officers' commands to drop the knife, the GBI said. They said Schultz approached the officers, despite continuous commands. Scout Shultz served as president of the Georgia Tech Pride Alliance GT Progressive Student Alliance      The GBI said that is when one of the officers shot Schultz.      Schultz was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital and later died, the GBI said.      Schultz's family is speaking about the incident at a law firm in Atlanta Monday.      We have a reporter and photographer at the news conference for live reports on Channel 2 Action News at Noon.      Georgia Tech released a statement Sunday morning, saying Schultz was a four-year computer engineering student from Lilburn.      Schultz was a leader in the LGBT pride community on campus was known as \\"Scout.\\" The student-activist served as the president of the Pride Alliance on Georgia Tech's campus. Schultz's profile on the Pride Alliance website states \\"I'm bisexual, non-binary and intersex,\\" adding \\"they\\" and \\"their\\" as the appropriate pronouns to address Schultz instead of \\"he\\" or \\"she.\\" The profile also states Schultz enjoyed playing the role-playing game \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" and is politically active.      In a statement from the Pride Alliance's board, Schultz is remembered as a driving force behind the group.      As you might have heard, last night we lost our President, Scout Schultz. We are all deeply saddened by what has occurred. They have been the driving force behind Pride Alliance for the past two years. They pushed us to do more events and a larger variety events, and we would not be the organization we are known as without their constant hard work and dedication. Their leadership allowed us to create change across campus and in the Atlanta community. Scout always reminded us to think critically about the intersection of identities and how a multitude of factors play into one's experience on Tech's campus and beyond. We love you Scout and we will continue to push for change. With love,      Pride Alliance      A vigil will be held to honor Schultz's life at 8 p.m. Monday at the Georgia Tech Campanile.      In an exclusive interview with our partners at the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, Scout's mother Lynne says her oldest child was active in progressive causes and was a brilliant student despite having medical problems.      She told the paper, \\"(Scout) suffered from depression and attempted suicide two years ago.\\"      Channel 2 Action News was at the scene when the knife Schultz was suspected of holding was still on the ground.      It appeared to be a metal, flip-open, multitool knife that would likely include a small blade.      \\"I mean things happen off campus, but it's kind of shaking for it to happen right so close to home,\\" one student said.      TRENDING STORIES:      Several of the students nearby did see the incident, and two who recorded it on their cellphones shared video of the incident with Channel 2 Action News.      One video shows the tense moments as Georgia Tech police officers confront what looks like a barefooted person holding something in their right hand.      The person yells at police to shoot.      \\"Shoot me!” they yell.      Police yell back: “Drop the knife! Drop the knife!\\"      Officers can be heard repeating the command more than a dozen times.      \\"Nobody wants to hurt you man. Drop the knife,\\" an officer says.      Another angle from further away shows three officers in front and another off to Schultz's left, at the entrance to Curran parking deck.      It pans away to show another officer walking up from behind as you hear only one gunshot.      Channel 2 Action News has chosen, both on-air and online, to not to show the moment of the shooting.      The video does show Schultz walking forward, toward police slowly, with hands still at his side when one of the officers fired.      Students received an emergency alert from the university shortly after the shooting.      The school tweeted around 11:30 p.m. for everyone to seek shelter in a secure location. About 20 minutes later, the school sent another tweet saying there was no longer a threat to campus.      Schultz's family attorney confirmed to Channel 2's Nefertiti Jaquez he is currently conducting his own investigation into exactly what happened during the shooting.      The attorney is expected to address the media on Monday morning.      Georgia Tech confirms shooting on campus.

That student, Scout Schultz, left three suicide notes behind in a dormitory room, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.      The developments added further layers of complexity to the death of Schultz, a 21-year-old who led the university’s Pride Alliance and had a history of mental illness.      In the call to police Saturday night, Schultz described a suspicious person “as a white male, with long blond hair, white T-shirt & blue jeans who is possibly intoxicated, holding a knife and possibly armed with a gun on his hip,” according to a statement from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.      Investigators said a multipurpose tool that contained a knife was recovered from the scene. The statement did not say whether the knife was displayed but said no firearms were recovered.      An attorney for Schultz’s family said in a statement Monday night the knife remained in its holder and Scout’s arms were at the student’s side.      “It’s tragic that as Scout was battling mental health issues that pushed them to the edge of desperation, their life was taken with a bullet rather than saved with non-lethal force,” said the statement from L. Chris Stewart, the Schultz family attorney.      The parents of Schultz said their child, who identified as neither male nor female, had suffered from anxiety and depression, and had spent time in counseling after attempting suicide by hanging two years ago.      But Scout’s death stunned Lynne and Bill Schultz, who described Scout as “a very loving and caring and empathetic person.”      “I don’t think there was a single person that didn’t love them and cherish them for their involvement in the different causes,” Bill Schultz said.      On Monday night about 50 people marched to the campus police department following a memorial vigil, according to University spokesman Lance Wallace. Three people were arrested after protesters set one police vehicle on fire and injured two officers.      Schultz’s family urged protesters to act peacefully in a statement released through their attorney, according to the Associated Press.      “Answering violence with violence is not the answer. Our goal is to work diligently to make positive change at Georgia Tech in an effort to ensure a safer campus for all students.”      The shooting in Atlanta comes as police nationwide continue to face protest and media scrutiny over the use of deadly force. Police across the country shoot and kill an average of three people each day, a rate virtually unchanged in recent years despite calls from police leaders and the public for reform.      Mental illness remains a major factor in fatal police shootings, playing a role in at least one-fourth of all such shootings — at least 159 so far in 2017 — according to a Washington Post analysis.      Police reform groups have long emphasized the need for officers to undergo specialized crisis intervention training to learn best practices for interaction with people who are in the midst of a mental health crisis, but many police departments still do not require such training.      Since January 2015, police nationwide have shot and killed at least 392 people who were armed with knives, blades or other edged weapons — an average of about one such shooting every four days — according to the Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings.      At least 102 of those cases, including the shooting of Schultz, occurred in 2017.      Fatal shootings of people armed with knives account for about 14 percent of the nearly 2,700 deadly police shootings tracked by The Post since the beginning of 2015.      Officers from Georgia Tech’s campus police force encountered Schultz, a computer engineering student, in a parking lot outside a dormitory, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.      Schultz wasn’t holding a gun in video captured from a window above the parking lot shortly before midnight, as the campus was placed on lockdown.      Stewart, the attorney, said Schultz was shot once and that the bullet pierced the heart. Stewart said only one officer fired and that none of the other officers who responded from the Georgia Tech police department had been issued Tasers. A spokesman for Georgia Tech told CNN that campus police do not carry stun guns.      “That’s baffling to me that on a college campus you’d rather give the officers the most deadly weapons and not equip them with less lethal weapons,” Stewart said, noting that Schultz’s family is hoping the death leads to reforms within the department, including better training.      Video shows officers repeatedly telling Schultz to drop the weapon as the student advances.      “Come on, man, let’s drop the knife,” an officer with his gun drawn says in the graphic video. But Schultz walks toward him.      “Shoot me!”      The officer keeps backing up, moving behind a parking barricade and imploring again: “Nobody wants to hurt you, man.”      At least four officers had surrounded Schultz, according to WSB-TV. In the video, one of the officers called out to the student, who turned away from the barricade and began to move toward the new voice.      “What are we doing here?” the officer asked. No reply.      “Do not move!”      [After Minneapolis police officer fatally shoots Australian woman, her relatives plead for answers]      “Drop it!” someone said finally, as Schultz takes three more steps toward an officer, followed by the report of a gunshot and many screams. Schultz died Sunday at an Atlanta hospital.      While the state’s investigative bureau referred to Schultz as a male — “Scott Schultz” — the student and the student’s family used the pronoun “them,” and on the Pride Alliance website Schultz used the description “bisexual, nonbinary and intersex.”      “When I’m not running Pride or doing classwork I mostly play D&D and try to be politically active,” Schultz wrote.      Bill Schultz said recently that Scout had expressed interest in the anti-fascist political movement and frustration with news coverage of police-involved shootings.      “I will say this, that recently Scout has been slightly involved with the anti-fascist community and had expressed a number of anti-fascist ideas to me,” he said.      “I tend to think that if there was a cause it might have been anger at the police over all the shootings and all the long litany of police shootings.”      In a statement, Pride Alliance called its late president the “driving force” behind the LGBT group for the past two years.      “They pushed us to do more events and a larger variety events, and we would not be the organization we are known as without their constant hard work and dedication,” the statement reads.      “We love you Scout and we will continue to push for change.”      Scout, a fourth-year student at Georgia Tech, was born in Rockville, Md., and spent time in Iowa, Missouri and Florida before moving to the Atlanta area six years ago. Bill Schultz, a retired computer engineer, said Scout came by an interest in engineering earnestly and was scheduled to graduate a semester early.      “Scout was definitely a chip off the old block,” he said.      Both parents remembered well the time that Scout came out to them.      “It wasn’t a shock because we’re welcoming and loving parents,” Bill Schultz said. “It shouldn’t have been hard for Scout to come out but I think there were some issues involved there which is why they did a session in therapy.”      Lynne Schultz said that any of Scout’s mental health issues appeared to have been resolved and that friends had told them that Scout seemed fine in recent weeks.      “We had no clue that there was an issue in the last four weeks,” she said.      Lynne Schultz said that they have received an outpouring of support from members of the community and that more than 30 friends showed up to the hospital in the middle of the night when Scout was shot.      “Scout had a lot more friends than I realized,” she said.      Bill Schultz said Scout was “all justice for everyone. Now, we have to seek justice for Scout.”      “We’re proud of them for standing up for what they believe in,” Lynne Schultz said.

Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church. The construction of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry.

What is the solution?","output":"Okay little one, let's play a fun game with numbers! We need to find the missing number 'c'. First, let's look at the numbers with 'c' next to each other—1466*c, 981*c, and -896*c. We need to put them together like this: 1466*c + 981*c - 896*c. Now, let's do the addition step by step. 1466 + 981 = 2447. So it becomes 2447*c. Now, we need to take away 896 from 2447. So, 2447 - 896 = 1551. So now we have: 1551*c. Now let's look at our original game: -1371*c = 1551*c - 35064. We need to put -1371*c and 1551*c together by moving the -1371*c to the other side. This looks like: 1551*c - (-1371*c). When we remove a negative number, it's like adding a positive number. So, 1551 + 1371 = 2922. Now we have: 2922*c = 35064. To finish the game and find the missing number 'c', we should divide both sides by 2922. So: c = 35064 / 2922. If we do the division, we find that: c = 12. Yay! We found the missing number! So, c = 12 is the answer to our game. Great job solving the number puzzle!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The events of June 6, 1944, played a pivotal role in the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi control, altering the course of the war. In this commemorative article, let's delve into the historic photos that capture the essence of the Invasion of Normandy. Step 1: Collecting and researching historical photos To create a compelling article, it is essential to gather a wide range of high-quality images from reputable sources such as the National Archives or Associated Press. The photographs should reflect various aspects of the D-Day invasion, including preparations, the crossing of the English Channel, and soldiers fighting on the beaches. Additionally, supplemental research about each photo's context should be conducted to provide accurately detailed captions. Step 2: Organizing the photos chronologically To provide a cohesive narrative, the photos should be organized chronologically, starting with the buildup to D-Day and ending with the aftermath. This approach allows readers to follow the progression of the invasion and understand the challenges faced and victories won during this pivotal event. Step 3: Crafting an engaging narrative As the article is comprised primarily of visual elements, the accompanying text should be concise yet informative. Introduce each photo with a brief paragraph that provides historical context and highlights its significance. Additionally, include poignant quotes from the soldiers and veterans who experienced these events firsthand, adding emotional depth to the article. Step 4: Writing detailed captions Besides the introductory paragraph for each photo, detailed captions are crucial to enhance the readers' understanding of the images. The captions should include the date and location of each photograph, along with a description of the depicted events. Furthermore, attribute the source of each photo and mention the photographer if possible. Step 5: Editing and proofreading To ensure the article is informative and engaging, it is essential to review and refine the written content. Verify the accuracy of historical context and captions by cross-referencing your research. Proofread the text for grammatical errors and awkward phrasing to ensure it flows smoothly for the reader. Step 6: Designing the article layout Once the images, paragraphs, and captions are finalized, arrange them in a visually appealing format within the article. Consider using larger images for significant events and moments to emphasize their importance. Step 7: Adding a conclusion To wrap up the article, summarize key points in a conclusion. Reflect on the impact of the D-Day invasion and how the photos provide a unique and stirring glimpse into history. Pay homage to the bravery and heroism of the soldiers who fought on D-Day and remind readers of the importance of remembering and learning from the past. Conclusion: Seventy years later, D-Day remains a powerful reminder of the bravery and sacrifice made by countless men and women during World War II. The historic photos from the Invasion of Normandy not only connect us with the past, but they also inspire us to appreciate those who fought for our freedom. As we mark this significant milestone, let us never forget the heroes who risked their lives to change the course of history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. The first post-Crisis appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 Legends miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen's and J. M. DeMatteis' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from Legends), he was given his own miniseries titled Shazam!: The New Beginning. With this four-issue miniseries, writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story. Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of Shazam! and the Justice Society of America characters. Before the Crisis, Thomas wrote several of the DC Comics Presents stories featuring the Marvel Family.  The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities.  This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology Action Comics Weekly #623-626 (October 25, 1988 - November 15, 1988), in which a Neo-Nazi version of Captain Mazi was introduced. At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new Shazam! ongoing series. Though New Beginning had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas. As a result, Thomas' intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new punk-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka \\"Spike\\") who was not Billy's sister, and an African-American take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print. Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the Shazam! project.  Other attempts at reviving Shazam! were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by John Byrne, illustrator of Legends and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries The Man of Steel (1986). None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's War of the Gods miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had finally ceased the fee-per-use licensing agreement with Fawcett Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else happen in the 1980s","output":"In the 1980s, after Captain Marvel's first post-Crisis appearance in the 1986 Legends miniseries, he appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen's and J.

However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, language-wise, than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard a half-dozen usage's of the Lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one. Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the Godly \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in \\"Gods and Generals.\\" Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.

Written by David Allison, the series began on 1 May 2009. Hypothesis: Boy Meets Girl won an emmy","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"Boy Meets Girl won an Emmy,\\" we need to analyze the information provided in the context and gather additional relevant data. Context summary: - Boy Meets Girl is an ITV comedy-drama television miniseries. - Stars include Rachael Stirling and Martin Freeman. - The show is centered around Danny Reed (played by Martin Freeman) who experiences a lightning strike and ends up trapped in the body of a woman named Veronica Burton (portrayed by Rachael Stirling). - The series was written by David Allison and premiered on 1 May 2009. Based on this context, we cannot directly conclude whether or not Boy Meets Girl won an Emmy. Additional information: The Emmy Awards are presented by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in the United States. The awards specifically recognize achievements in the television industry. The Emmys are mostly centered around American television shows, so international ones (including those from the UK) may not be relevant to these awards. However, British Television productions have been recognized by The British Academy Television Awards (BAFTA), organized by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, though it is not mentioned in the context whether Boy Meets Girl received any awards or nominations. To ascertain the validity of the hypothesis, a search of reliable sources is required. Upon conducting research, one can find that Boy Meets Girl did not win an Emmy, as it was not nominated for any Emmy Awards. In conclusion, after examining both the context and additional relevant information, we can state that the hypothesis \\"Boy Meets Girl won an Emmy\\" is false. It is important to consider that the context did not provide any information about the show winning or being nominated for any awards, let alone the Emmy Awards. Furthermore, the context focused on describing the plot, actors, and premiere date of Boy Meets Girl, rather than discussing its accolades within the television industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed.  I am facing a new situation today: A new volcano is growing underwater. Every few days it has minor lava flow eruptions off the coast of Hawaii. People have actually enjoyed swimming in the water above this newly forming volcano because it is very soothing and relaxing.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will the speed of molecules increase or decrease as temperature decreases? Answer:","output":"The speed of molecules will decrease as the temperature decreases. According to the kinetic-molecular theory, the average speed of particles (in this case, the molecules in the water) is dependent upon the temperature. When the temperature is higher, the particles move faster, while lower temperatures result in slower particle movement.

Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island.  Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems.

It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing.

It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

As a punishment Hera made Echo unable to speak except to repeat the last three words of the person she was talking to. Poor Echo fell in love with Narcissus but could never tell him how she felt. Narcissus teased her and she ran away with tears pouring down her face. Aphrodite, the goddess of love saw what happened and decided to punish Narcissus.

Narcissus stopped eating, lost his beautiful looks and desired to get his love. In the end he anguished gradually and died.

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban  areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. \\"When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,\\" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. \\"She will also know how to take better care of her family.\\" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Per the Kremlin, that's the gist of the New Year's message the Russian president sent over to his US counterpart, telling President Trump that a \\"mutual respect\\" is what's needed as \\"a base to develop relations,\\" the AP and AFP report. \\"The development [of] a constructive Russian-US dialogue is particularly important for strengthening strategic stability in the world and finding the optimal answers to global threats and challenges,\\" Putin is said to have added. The AP notes that Putin's message comes at a time when relations between the US and Russia are the worst since the Cold War era, in part due to Russia's occupation of Crimea and its interference in the US election. Putin also sent end-of-year correspondence to French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, expressing \\"sincere hope that key changes for the better will continue in Syria in the new year\\" and vowing to \\"show all kind of support\\" to Syria in its efforts to \\"protect its state sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity.\\" Expand this summary.","output":"Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, is entering the new year with a sense of optimism regarding the future of US-Russia relations. He hopes that both countries will be able to maintain a pragmatic cooperation that will enable them to work together towards shared goals. In a New Year's message to US President Donald Trump, Putin emphasized the importance of mutual respect and constructive dialogue as the foundation for developing the relationship between the two nations. Putin's message comes at a time when the relationship between the United States and Russia is at its lowest point since the Cold War era. This is mainly due to Russia's controversial annexation of Crimea and its alleged interference in the US presidential elections, which has led to numerous sanctions and diplomatic expulsions on both sides. Despite these setbacks, Putin believes that strengthening strategic stability around the world and finding optimal solutions to global threats and challenges would be possible through a constructive Russian-US dialogue. In addition to his message to President Trump, Putin also sent end-of-year correspondence to other global leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Among these communications, Putin expressed his sincere hope for positive changes in Syria in the new year. He assured that Russia would continue to support Syria's efforts to protect its state sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. The Russian president's New Year's message indicates a willingness to improve relations with the United States and potentially seek common ground on various global issues. While it remains to be seen if President Trump will reciprocate Putin's sentiments, these messages demonstrate that there is still hope for improved diplomatic relations between the two countries. To achieve this goal, both nations would need to work collaboratively, addressing contentious issues such as cyber security, arms control, and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Additionally, it would be crucial for Russia and the United States to foster a relationship built on trust and transparency to mitigate any potential setbacks that may arise from miscommunication or misunderstandings. In conclusion, Vladimir Putin's New Year's message to President Trump and other global leaders signifies a desire to reestablish positive relationships in the global community, particularly with the United States. Despite the current state of diplomatic relations, President Putin remains hopeful that both nations can move toward a pragmatic cooperation that will benefit not only Russia and the United States, but also the entire world. By addressing global threats and challenges together, the two countries can potentially have a significant impact on the future of international relations and stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The word \\"Vollnarkose\\" means general or full anaesthesia. \\"steht in der Praxis ein qualifiziertes und erfahrenes Anästhesieteam zur Verfügung\\" means \\"a qualified and experienced anesthetic team is available in the practice\\". The phrase \\"ein qualifiziertes und erfahrenes Anästhesieteam\\" refers to \\"a qualified and experienced anesthesia team\\", while \\"zur Verfügung\\" is used to indicate that something is \\"available\\" or \\"at your disposal\\". \\"In der Praxis\\" simply translates to \\"in the practice\\". German, like many other European languages, tends to structure sentences longer and more complex than in English and it's not uncommon for words to be arranged in a manner that may seem unusual or awkward when translated literally into English. This is due to the differences in grammar rules between the two languages. Therefore, when translating a sentence from English to German, it's important to not only translate the words, but to also adapt the sentence structure to fit the grammatical rules of German. English to German translations also require a deep understanding of the subtleties and nuances of both languages, taking into consideration the cultural context and the connotations that specific words may have. For instance, a word that means one thing in English might have slightly different implications or connotations in German. This is why translations often need to be done by humans or very sophisticated AI programs that can understand these nuances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words to clarify or explain the original content. In this case, both sentences convey similar ideas but have a slight difference in meaning. Sentence 1: \\"Jane manages to survive and Michael finally loses her virginity.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"finally\\" suggests that there has been an ongoing or continuous effort or expectation for Michael to lose her virginity, and Jane's survival plays a role in this event. The emphasis is on the fact that the action has taken place after a considerable amount of time or effort. Sentence 2: \\"Jane manages to survive and Michael loses her virginity.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"finally\\" is missing, which alters the implied context of the situation. It states that Jane survives and Michael loses her virginity but does not indicate any previous expectations or efforts concerning this event. Therefore, the answer is (A). No, the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other.

The answer to the question: What did Bernard's band rename itself in 1978? is inside the article: On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"In 1978, Bernard Sumner's band renamed itself from \\"Warsaw\\" to \\"Joy Division.\\" The name change was partly to avoid confusion with another band named Warsaw Pakt and also due to the band members finding inspiration from the fiction novel \\"House of Dolls,\\" where \\"Joy Divisions\\" were groups of women kept captive for the pleasure of Nazi soldiers during World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The six workers and one volunteer were travelling in a four-vehicle convoy in the north of the country when the attackers blocked their path and opened fire, according to Syria state media. They had been delivering medical supplies in the Idlib province when the abduction took place near the town of Saraqeb, at around 11.30am local time.

Treatment: A spokesman has called for the immediate release of the workers, saying they are urgently needed to help the people of Syria. The Syrian media reports blamed the attack on 'terrorists' - a term often used to describe the rebels fighting President Bashar Assad. The Idlib area has been largely under rebel control for the past year. A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross today confirmed that the people had been kidnapped, but that they had not been contacted by anybody claiming responsibility.

War-torn: The kidnapping took place in the dangerous Idlib province. 'We. are calling for their immediate and unconditional release of this team. which was delivering humanitarian assistance to those most in need - and. we do that on both sides of the front lines.' The Red Cross has not offered any information about the gender of nationality of the six employees who were captured. However, a spokesman said that the team had been in the field since 10 October to assess the medical situation in the area and to look at how to provide medical aid in the province, which is said to be: 'by definition is a difficult area to go in.' News of the kidnapping came as further. violence erupted in the Syrian capital, Damascus, where state media. also reported that its own headquarters in the city's Umayyad Square were damaged by two car bombs.

The family decided to wait for a while and see how the lizard survived several months without moving. While they were doing other things, they kept an eye on the lizard. The son, Ray, suddenly shouted, \\"Dad, look here!\\" Another lizard appeared, carrying food to the stuck lizard's mouth. That was a real surprise! Everyone was touched that the lizard fed the other one for all this time. Both lizards had never-ending hope for each other and carried their hearts with love and care. Why can't we humans always carry that kind of love in our hearts? Life is full of all kinds of difficulties. What we can do is to give our hand to the one in need and share our love. Sharing is caring. Question: Which of the following is NOT true? - The lizards didn't give up hope. - The son helped the stuck lizard out. - Another lizard came to feed the stuck one. - The family was moved by the lizard's act.

Please answer the following question: Question: Why do people take up running? Options: - shortness of breath - weight loss - faster travel - stitches - heart attack  Explain why a human would choose \\"weight loss\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"weight loss\\" to answer the question above because running is a form of aerobic exercise that helps in burning calories and shedding excess body weight. Let's break down the explanation step-by-step: 1. Aerobic exercise: Running is an aerobic exercise that increases heart rate and oxygen intake, stimulating the cardiovascular system and improving overall fitness. 2. Calorie burning: Running engages large muscle groups like the legs and core, which require energy to function. As a result, the body burns calories while running, contributing to weight loss. 3. Long-term benefits: Consistent running is known to help maintain a healthy weight over time through the continuous burning of calories. 4. Comparing with the other options:  - \\"shortness of breath\\" and \\"stitches\\" are temporary and uncomfortable conditions that may result from running, but they aren't reasons for taking up running. - \\"faster travel\\" might be a minor benefit or motivation for some people, but it's not the primary reason most people take up running. Also, for longer distances or daily commuting, other means of transportation are much faster. - \\"heart attack\\" is an unlikely reason for taking up running, as running aims to improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of heart attacks. Given all these factors, weight loss emerges as the primary reason why a human would choose to take up running among the given options. This is because running provides a proven and efficient way to burn calories, maintain a healthy weight, and improve overall health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the imbalance of ocean mass fluxes. After the volcano eruption, evaporation over ocean becomes lower, because it is largely determined by the ocean skin temperature change. The quick response of evaporation to the surface cooling and the delayed response of river runoff to the associated lower precipitation lead to an increased sea level. About 1~2 years later, river discharge becomes less due to the reduced precipitation and less sea ice melting, which cause sea level to drop.[9]  Now, I have a new situation: In the beginning of year 1000 mount Etna had a huge volcanic eruption. To test the effect of volcanic eruption on sea level scientists measured geological data through carbon dating.

Queen's Park Football Club is a Scottish football club based in Glasgow. The club is currently the only fully amateur club in the Scottish Professional Football League; its amateur status is reflected by its Latin motto, Ludere Causa Ludendi - \\"to play for the sake of playing\\". Queen's Park is the oldest association football club in Scotland, having been founded in 1867, and is the oldest outside England and Wales. Queen's Park is also the only Scottish football club to have played in the FA Cup Final, achieving this feat in both 1884 and 1885. The 1975-76 season saw the reconstruction of the Scottish Leagues and Queen's entered the Second Division. Coinciding with this, Queen's appointed a head coach for the first time. Davie McParland led Queen's to 4th place but left at the end of the season to join Partick Thistle. Joe Gilroy was his successor and Queen's finished 5th, 7th and 13th under his guidance before his departure at the end of 1978-79 season.  Former player Eddie Hunter took charge and within two seasons, Queen's had been promoted as 1980-81 champions. The talent in the side was obvious. Derek Atkins was an ever-present in goal, John McGregor a high scoring defender and Jimmy Nicholson and Gerry McCoy netted a combined tally of 28 goals. Much of the side was inexperienced, with full-back Bobby Dickson one of the few who had been a mainstay in previous years. After a highly respectable finish of 8th the following season, Queen's finished bottom and were relegated in 1983. The main reason for this was the loss of some of the players who had won Queen's promotion. In particular, John McGregor and Alan Irvine departed, leaving for Liverpool and Everton respectively. During the same season, Queen's lost 2-1 to Rangers at Hampden in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals.  Recovery took a while but eventually a good side featuring Stevie Ross, Kenny Brannigan, Ian McCall and Ross Caven finished 4th in 1985-86 - winning three more games than the Championship side of 1981. Queen's lost narrowly by 2-1 at Celtic Park in the 4th round of the Scottish Cup in the February 1986.  1987-88 was a further improvement but 21 victories was only enough for 3rd place. 1990-91 was another season of frustration as Queen's squandered a chance for promotion after having been in contention for so long and finished 5th, only four points behind 2nd place Montrose.

With 7 seconds left in the 1st half, the Eagles attempted to go up 13-0 with a field goal, instead, the kick was blocked and returned 71 yards by Kevin Dockery for a Giants touchdown. That cut the lead to 10-7. Early in the third quarter, Donovan McNabb found Brian Westbrook for a 40-yard Eagles touchdown that increased their lead to 17-7. Philadelphia would score again in the 3rd with a 34-yard field goal by David Akers. The Giants would score on a 1-yard pass from Eli Manning to Darcy Johnson with 20 seconds left in the game, but couldn't recover an onside kick and the Eagles won the game.

But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\"  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Women who are not divorced can't obtain child support in which state?\\" is \\"Texas\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the above paragraph, women who are not divorced can't obtain child support in Texas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Everything is quiet. Two young men in a car say nothing to each other. They arrive at a marked \\"wilderness\\" trail and head off without anything but the clothes on their back and an extra shirt. With energy and boundlessness they go and go and go. They mention the \\"thing\\" that they're apparently going to and how it should be there somewhere. They have no map.

He was best known for his appearances with the American professional wrestling promotions Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation under the ring name Mike Awesome and for his appearances in Japan for with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling as The Gladiator. Alfonso achieved the biggest success of his career in FMW as The Gladiator, where he became a three-time world champion, with two reigns as Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and one reign as Independent Heavyweight Champion. His second Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship reign from 1996-1997 was the longest reign in the title's history, lasting for 489 days. In 1993, Alfonso appeared in NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) for a short period (as \\"Awesome\\" Mike Awesome) before returning to FMW.  On February 5, 1994 at ECW's event, The Night the Line was Crossed, Awesome nearly injured wrestler, J.T. Smith when he performed a high-risk dive to the outside of the ring. Smith's back was folded backwards against the guard rail during the impact. This spot appeared in many ECW highlight reels including the intro to a variety of their television programs for years to come. (according to ECW announcer Joey Styles his own reaction to the spot inspired his \\"Oh my God\\" catchphrase).  In 1995 he made a one night appearance in ECW with The Triple Threat in addressing The Masked Man ( Rick Rude).  In January 1998, Awesome began appearing for ECW again and continued his feud with Masato Tanaka in the United States. Awesome began in ECW by losing to Tanaka on an episode ECW's weekly Hardcore TV. However, following the match, he delivered an Awesome Bomb to Tanaka over the top rope through a table set up on the outside. In his final appearance of his second ECW stint, Awesome lost to Tanaka again at the August Heat Wave pay-per-view event.  Almost immediately upon arriving in ECW for his third stint in September 1999, he shocked the wrestling world by winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Anarchy Rulz by defeating the reigning champion Taz and nemesis Masato Tanaka in a three-way dance, which was signed on the spot. Awesome continued to be a major factor in ECW early in 2000, including teaming with Raven to beat Tanaka and Tommy Dreamer for the ECW World Tag Team Championship. He gained a new manager, Judge Jeff Jones, whom managed Awesome to the top of winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship twice in 1999.

Do cats rub their faces against people more if they go for several days without showering? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the consequences of rubbing a cat's fur in the wrong direction, while the second question is about cats' behavior in response to humans who haven't showered for several days. 1. Why should you never rub a cat's fur the wrong way? Rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way can lead to several adverse outcomes for both the cat and the person engaging in the behavior: a. Discomfort: Rubbing a cat's fur in the opposite direction disrupts the natural alignment of the hair shafts, leading to discomfort for the animal. Cats maintain a specific hair structure for a variety of reasons, including insulation, protection, and facilitating their grooming process. Disrupting this structure can cause irritation and stress for the cat. b. Stress and Anxiety: Cats are sensitive creatures that rely on their environment, routine, and the people in their lives for a sense of security. An action that causes discomfort or pain, such as rubbing their fur the wrong way, increases their stress and anxiety levels. This can lead to behavior changes, such as aggression, hiding, or overgrooming. c. Aggression: A cat that feels threatened or uncomfortable might respond aggressively in an attempt to protect itself. This could involve biting, scratching, or hissing at the person causing the disturbance. Thus, rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way could lead to injuries or escalating tensions between the animal and its owner. d. Damage to the coat: Repeatedly rubbing a cat's fur in the wrong direction can cause damage to its coat. This may result in hair breakage, tangling, or matting, which compromises the cat's overall health and well-being. 2. Do cats rub their faces against people more if they go for several days without showering? When cats rub their faces against people, they engage in a behavior called \\"bunting.\\" Bunting serves several purposes: a. Scent-marking: Cats have scent glands on various parts of their bodies, including their cheeks. When they rub their faces against objects or people, they deposit pheromones, which are chemical signals that communicate information to other cats or identify territories. A person who has not showered for several days has a stronger odor, which might prompt a cat to engage in bunting more frequently to reinforce its scent mark on that individual. b. Affection: Cats express their affection for people by rubbing their faces against them. They may do this more frequently with someone they have a strong bond with or feel comfortable around. The showering habits of a person may not necessarily influence this behavior, as long as the cat remains familiar with the individual and their scent. c. Comfort-seeking: Some cats may find the scent of their surroundings or people comforting. If a person hasn't showered for a few days, their scent will be more pronounced, which could make the cat feel more at ease and prompt it to engage in bunting behavior more frequently. However, it is essential to note that individual cats have distinct personalities, preferences, and reactions. Some cats may not react differently to a person who hasn't showered, while others may increase their bunting behavior. Observing your cat's specific habits and reactions is crucial to understanding its needs and maintaining a healthy relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: The koala dashed up the palm tree so fast, but couldn't grasp the cactus well. The cactus was (A) more smooth (B) less smooth A:","output":"The cactus was (B) less smooth. When comparing a palm tree and a cactus, it is important to consider their distinctive features and how they would affect an animal like a koala attempting to climb them. Let's take a closer look at both plants to understand this better. Palm trees are characterized by their tall, straight trunks, which are relatively uniform in texture, and their feathery, frond-like leaves that extend from the top. The trunk of a palm tree is relatively smooth with only minor inconsistencies in texture, such as the horizontal markings left by fallen leaves. This surface offers a koala the necessary support and grip to climb quickly, allowing them to ascend with ease. On the other hand, cacti are a type of plant that is native to arid regions. They have evolved to retain moisture in their thick stems. Many species of cacti have spines, which are specialized leaves that help them protect their water-rich flesh from hungry animals. These spines may vary in number, size, and density, depending on the specific type of cactus, but in general, they create a rough, prickly surface that poses a significant challenge to any creature attempting to climb or grip it. In the given scenario, the koala dashed up the palm tree swiftly because it could manage the smooth trunk with minimal difficulty. However, as it attempted to grasp the cactus, it likely faced two major challenges. First, the cactus' spines would have made it considerably more difficult for the koala to find a comfortable grip that did not result in injury. Second, cacti's surfaces, in general, are more irregular in shape and texture compared to the cylindrical and even-textured trunk of a palm tree. In summary, the cactus was (B) less smooth, making it more challenging for the koala to grasp and climb. This difference in texture between the palm tree and the cactus is due to their particular adaptations that enable them to survive in their respective environments, which impacts accessibility for creatures like koalas that attempt to interact with them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Most historical fiction begins with a focus on an exact time period and location. You should consider a time period that you are interested in or curious about as well as a location within that time period that might be interesting to readers. Be specific when you choose a time period and location, as the more specific you are, the more specific your research will be. This will allow you to uncover fascinating historical details about the time period and location that you can then use in your fiction. For example, rather than choose, “20th century, France,\\" you may choose “1935, Paris.\\" Or, rather than choose “18th century America,\\" you may choose to focus on “1776, Philadelphia.\\" The first place you can go to for research is your local library. Talk to the reference librarian about your specific time period and location. Ask him or her for possible texts that can help you get a better sense of everyday life in the era.  Look for encyclopedias that focus on specific time periods and locations. You can also look up biographies of historical figures who were alive during the time period. You can read scholarly texts that focus on specific elements of the time period and location, such as what people ate in 1776, Philadelphia or how people dined out in 1935, Paris. You may be able to lean on historical texts that delve deep into the everyday customs and practices of the time. You can also see if your local library has catalogues, magazines, and newspapers from the time period and location. Often, libraries will have these resources on microfilm, allowing you to browse through the news stories, trends, and talk of the day. Magazines and catalogues can be a useful way to get a sense of how people were writing, talking, and gossiping during your chosen time period. You can also notice any popular slang or terms from the time period and the more popular products consumed by people during the time period. You may need to expand your research practices to discussions with professionals who are experts in a certain time period and location. You can find these experts by searching for the authors of historical texts online or by talking to other professionals in the field. You should then contact them and ask for a meeting about specific details that will help you create a more believable historical world for your story.  You should look for experts that are very proficient in a certain aspect of the time period, such as an expert in embroidery in 17th century America or an expert in the origins of horse racing in 19th century Paris. This will then allow you to ask them very specific questions about the time period and get specific answers in return. You can also ask experts to refer you to other experts they may know, creating a network of experts for you to lean on as you write your story. Using experts for different elements of your story will ensure you are getting an informed opinion and make your story feel more authentic. In our current digital age, it may seem more convenient and efficient to search for historical information online. However, you should do so with caution, as information on the internet is not always accurate or vetted by experts in the field. Do not assume that just because information is in an online encyclopedia or has been verified in some way by only one expert, it is correct. The internet can be a good place to get inspired and acquire some basic background information on your chosen time period. But it should not be your sole method of research. You should fact check all the information you get online with scholarly texts and discussions with history experts. Try to verify the information from the internet with other outside sources so you are sure you are using historical fact that you can then transform into fiction.","output":"The article explains how to research and write historical fiction by being specific about the time period and location, using resources like libraries and experts for accurate information, and fact-checking details found online."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer starts by expressing that they stopped by for a casual lunch, which immediately establishes a laid-back and informal setting. They proceed to complement the delicious food, indicating that they enjoyed their meal, even though it contains a high calorie count of around 9000.

Additionally, they highlight the availability of soft serve ice cream as another option to top off the meal, further emphasizing the enjoyable dining experience.

Given the following context:  \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\").   Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Janet and Barry Ashdown bought house in Holderness, East Yorks, in 1986. One of its main attractions was the large extended double garage. The previous owners did not register the extension with Land Registry. Planning permission for garage extension and driveway was granted in 1984. Battle with council could cost Ashdowns thousands of pounds of savings.","output":"Title: The Ashdowns' Saga: A Gripping Encounter With Bureaucracy Over an Unregistered House Extension In 1986, Janet and Barry Ashdown embarked on a new chapter of their life when they became homeowners in Holderness, East Yorkshire. The charming house they purchased had one particular attraction that stood out: a commodious extended double garage, perfectly suited to fit their needs. However, little did they know, this asset would later result in unexpected trials and tribulations that could potentially cost them thousands of pounds from their savings. The former owners, it appears, had applied for and been granted planning permission in 1984 for the extension of the garage and the driveway. Despite undertaking this procedural task compliantly, they glaringly omitted an equally crucial aspect - they failed to reflect this extension in the Land Registry. When the Ashdowns purchased the house, this oversight was, unfortunately for them, not made apparent. The issue erupted into a full-blown quandary when the omission was eventually noticed. Faced with a situation both unexpected and unwanted, the Ashdowns found themselves in a bitter standoff with the local council over the unregistered extension. An innocent escapade into the world of homeownership had led them into what appeared to be a bureaucratic battleground. One may ask, how important is registering a property extension? The ramifications of not doing so have become harshly apparent through the Ashdowns' experience. Registering a property, or modifications thereof, is an integral part of the legal process that guarantees the rights of a homeowner. It provides crucial evidence of the ownership of an area and of alterations to it, which, as the Ashdowns have discovered, can hold significant implications in dealing with local authorities. The saga has become a financial tempest for the Ashdowns. An ordeal that they should have been insulated against threatens to rob them of their hard-earned savings. Indeed, the legal fees and expenses associated with rectifying this oversight could run into thousands of pounds. Beyond the monetary costs, the stress and anxiety induced by this situation are immeasurable. This predicament stands as a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls faced by new homeowners. Diligence is a rugged shield against such mishaps. A thorough examination of property deeds and the details held in the Land Registry should be fundamental steps in the home buying process. Moreover, it highlights the importance of getting planning permissions and necessary certificates correctly registered by property owners to avoid future disputes or difficulties of such nature.  As the Ashdowns grapple with this challenging situation, their tale serves as both a cautionary tale and stark learning for homeowners and prospective buyers. It underscores the intrinsic importance of property registration and the potentially huge financial consequences of neglecting this crucial legal process. The couple's plight draws attention to the necessity of adhering to all procedures surrounding property acquisition, as one never knows when an aspect considered unimportant could snowball into a major crisis.  The Ashdowns' saga continues, a testament to the harsh realities that can be encountered in the world of homeownership. As they brace against the pending financial blow, their tale resonates as a firm reminder that the fine print should never be overlooked in property transactions. Life has a way of teaching lessons that are often overlooked, and unfortunately for the Ashdowns, theirs came in the form of an extended double garage."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given a medical question pair hand-generated.

Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a \\"real tree\\" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them. After revealing that he has \\"security camera eyes\\" all over the city, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight (with his grandmother's encouragement) and learns more of the trees' history.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more pollution occurs happens, how will it affect less trapped radiation occurs.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. If more pollution occurs, it leads to the release of more greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) into the atmosphere. These gases trap more heat, which would normally be radiated back to space, causing global warming. The direct effect of increased pollution is the additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap more heat and thus contribute to global warming. The indirect effects include the potential alteration of climate patterns, melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and harm to ecosystems and biodiversity. If the perturbation were to somehow lead to less trapped radiation, it could potentially counteract or partially mitigate the effects of global warming.

The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Legal Services Corp. (LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs  Question: \\"What organization did Congress approve restriction on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take?\\" Response: \\"LSC\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response accurately answers the question. The question is asking about the organization on which Congress imposed restrictions regarding the type of cases that federally funded legal aid attorneys can take on. According to the information in the preceding paragraph, this organization is the Legal Services Corp. (LSC).  Created in the 1970s, the LSC has a primary mission of providing legal assistance to individuals of limited financial means. However, in 1996, amid criticism from conservatives who believed the LSC was disproportionately supporting liberal causes or politically sensitive cases, Congress imposed various restrictions (Public Law 104-134) on the kind of work that LSC-funded attorneys could engage in.  More specifically, following these restrictions, lawyers receiving funding through the LSC were prohibited from engaging in a range of activities, which included lobbying legislature, filing class-action lawsuits, taking part in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, and defending public housing tenants charged with drug-related offenses. Despite the financial challenges and constraints imposed by these restrictions, the LSC has continued its operations, largely funded through federal appropriations. The annual budget - which pays for legal representation in civil cases for clients in situations such as domestic violence and child custody disputes - has fluctuated over the years. In 2003, President George W. Bush proposed a budget of 329 million for the LSC, the same amount allocated in the two previous years.  Thus, while the constraints have certainly shaped the work that LSC-funded attorneys can do, the organization continues to provide crucial legal services to individuals whose incomes do not exceed 125 percent of the federal poverty level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The systems that control U.S. military drones have been infected with a computer virus, a U.S. defense official confirmed to CNN on Monday. Despite the infection of the classified program, the virus has not \\"stopped flights worldwide,\\" the official said. The official declined to comment on how the systems were infected nor whether the virus has resisted attempts to remove it. The infection was first reported by Noah Shachtman for Wired magazine last week. \\"Military officials are more concerned than panicked by this virus. They're just really not sure what's going on. They're not sure if it's a deliberate attack. They're not sure if it's something accidental,\\" he said. While drones are flown on missions in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, the actual \\"cockpit\\" of the unmanned aircraft is on U.S. soil -- the operators work at Nevada's Creech Air Force Base. According to Wired, the virus, which records pilot key strokes, was first detected about two weeks ago. Tech specialists are unsure whether it was installed intentionally, Wired reported. Shachtman said the military has had a hard time wiping out the virus. \\"They're tried over and over again to get rid of this thing using some fairly conventional methods, and they haven't worked. And so it seems the only thing to get rid of this virus is to basically wipe the hard drives of these computers entirely and sort of rebuild the computers from scratch,\\" he said. But that can be an exhausting process. In 2008, removable hard drives introduced a virus into thousands of Defense Department computers, and to this day the Pentagon is still purging some machines. In the case of the computers that help coordinate the drones, care also has to be taken to back up all the information so it isn't lost during rebuilding. U.S. drone strikes have been responsible for the deaths of dozens of suspected militants. In recent years, the United States has sharply increased its used of unmanned planes to target insurgents in Pakistan's tribal region, a volatile area bordering war-torn Afghanistan. The covert CIA drone program has been deeply unpopular with many Pakistanis, who say the attacks kill civilians and violate their country's sovereignty. In August, a drone attack killed al Qaeda No. 2 Atiya Abdul Rahman in Pakistan. The most recent high-profile drone strike resulted in the death of U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen last month. Unmanned aerial vehicles have become indispensable for military planners who depend on constant combat air patrols. But current and former Pentagon officials admit the technology cuts both ways. At the confirmation hearing for Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said bluntly, \\"In the 21st century, bits and bytes can be as threatening as bullets and bombs.\\" He said even the National Defense University has been breached, and in a single intrusion this year 24,000 files were taken from a defense company. \\"Some of the stolen data is mundane, like the specifications for small parts of tanks, airplanes and submarines. But a great deal of it concerns our most sensitive systems, including avionics, surveillance technologies, satellite communications systems and network security protocols,\\" he said. Perhaps most alarming, Lynn admitted that up till now, the U.S. military had been unable to secure its systems. \\"Current countermeasures have not stopped this outflow of sensitive information,\\" Lynn said. \\"We need to do more to guard our digital storehouses of design innovation.\\" Officials have not yet determined whether the virus introduced into the drone program is benign, or doing actual harm. An investigation is ongoing. Despite the fact the controls are not linked into any outside network, and therefore seemingly impervious to intrusion, the drone systems do have security issues. Shachtman said they still use external hard drives, and when they're attached to top-secret computers they can open them up to infection. He said the true danger of the virus comes not from an ability to \\"bring down a drone,\\" which is unlikely, but from an erosion of trust. If officials come to think that the information they're receiving from the unmanned vehicles has been compromised, they're much less likely to view it as safe and valuable, he surmised.

Translate to English English:","output":"Insufficient nutrition reduces the effectiveness of the immune system. Insufficient nutrition refers to the lack of adequate nutrients and energy sources necessary for the proper functioning of the body. A balanced and varied diet is crucial to maintaining a healthy immune system and overall well-being. Several factors contribute to the relationship between nutrition and the immune system's effectiveness. Firstly, malnutrition can impair the production and activity of white blood cells, which are essential for defending the body against infections and diseases. White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are responsible for attacking and neutralizing various pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms. A weakened immune response due to an insufficient diet can result in increased vulnerability to infections. Secondly, micronutrients play a vital role in the proper functioning of the immune system. Vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A, C, D, E, B6, B12, folic acid, zinc, selenium, iron, and copper, contribute to the normal development of immune cells, the production of antibodies, and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Deficiencies in these micronutrients can compromise the immune system, making an individual more prone to infections and other health issues. In addition, a healthy gut microbiome is crucial for maintaining a strong immune system. The gut microbiome consists of trillions of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that live in the digestive tract. Insufficient nutrition can negatively impact the balance of these microorganisms, leading to imbalances and compromising the gut's ability to protect against pathogens, as well as promoting inflammation. Furthermore, excessive intake of unhealthy fats, sugars, and processed foods can not only lead to nutrient deficiencies but also cause chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation raises the risk of developing various disorders, including autoimmune diseases, asthma, allergies, and cardiovascular diseases. An imbalanced diet may also exacerbate existing health issues, further lowering the immune system's effectiveness. In summary, insufficient nutrition can have a detrimental effect on the immune system. A weakened immune response due to lack of adequate nutrients and energy sources may result in increased vulnerability to infections, hampered production and activity of white blood cells, a deficiency in vital micronutrients, an imbalance of the gut microbiome, and chronic inflammation. Therefore, it is essential to follow a balanced and varied diet to support a healthy immune system and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Paragraph: For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.  Question: \\"Beautiful Mediterranean weather year round allows for the tourists of Algarve to engage in what types of activities?\\" Answer: \\"Big-game fishing\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Options: [a]. no [b]. yes","output":"[b]. yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A vacuum solution is a solution of a field equation in which the sources of the field are taken to be identically zero. That is, such field equations are written without matter interaction (i.e.- set to zero).  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity.  - In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. QFT treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta.  - Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetrical state ends up in an asymmetrical state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry.  - The Sapienza University of Rome, (Italian: Sapienza  Università di Roma), also called simply Sapienza or the \\"University of Rome\\", is a collegiate research university located in Rome, Italy. Formally known as Università degli Studi di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\", it is the largest European university by enrollments (the third if considering also the distance learning schools) and one of the oldest in history, founded in 1303. The University is also the most prestigious Italian university and also the best ranked in Southern Europe.  - In physics, symmetry breaking is a phenomenon in which (infinitesimally) small fluctuations acting on a system crossing a critical point decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a bifurcation is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or \\"noise\\"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called symmetry \\"breaking\\", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but disorderly state into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is supposed to play a major role in pattern formation.  - In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being raised to an excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature).  - Southern Europe is the southern region of the European continent. Most definitions of Southern Europe, also known as Mediterranean Europe, include the countries of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the Italian peninsula, Southern France, Greece and Malta. Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of Southeast Europe, which are geographically technically in the southern part of Europe, but which have different historical, political, economic, and cultural backgrounds that commonly places them in the category of Eastern Europe.  - Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.  - The Accademia dei Lincei (literally the \\"Academy of the Lynx-Eyed\\", but anglicised as the Lincean Academy) is an Italian science academy, located at the Palazzo Corsini on the Via della Lungara in Rome, Italy.  - In physics, quasiparticles and collective excitations (which are closely related) are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves \\"as if\\" it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space. For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei; however it \\"approximately\\" behaves like an electron with a \\"different mass\\" (effective mass) traveling unperturbed through free space. This \\"electron\\" with a different mass is called an \\"electron quasiparticle\\". In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor is the same as if the semiconductor instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called holes. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), plasmons (particles derived from plasma oscillations), and many others.  - Giovanni Jona - Lasinio ( born 1932 ) , sometimes called Gianni Jona , is an Italian theoretical physicist , best known for his works on quantum field theory and statistical mechanics . He pioneered research concerning spontaneous symmetry breaking , and the Nambu -- Jona - Lasinio model is named after him .

How can I improve my English vocabulary? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Although the two questions posed are related, they are not precisely the same. The first question seeks methods to remember new words to expand one's vocabulary, while the second question broadly asks about improving English vocabulary. That being said, both inquiries require a focus on vocabulary improvement techniques. To provide a comprehensive response, I will address both questions by suggesting effective strategies for learning, remembering, and expanding your English vocabulary. 1. Read extensively: Reading a variety of material, such as books, articles, newspapers, and blogs, exposes you to different writing styles and new words. The more diverse your reading material, the more vocabulary you will encounter. While reading, note unfamiliar words, their context, and, if necessary, look up their meanings. 2. Keep a vocabulary journal: Document the new words you encounter along with their definitions, synonyms, and example sentences. This practice allows you to organize the words you are learning and enables quick refreshers when needed. 3. Learn a word a day: Choose a new word each day to focus on. Attempt to use it in conversation, writing, and social media posts. The repetition will help you remember the word and eventually make it a part of your active vocabulary. 4. Use mnemonics: Associate new words with images, stories, or other techniques to make them more memorable. This technique can be particularly helpful when learning complicated or abstract words. 5. Engage in conversation: Speak regularly with fluent or native English speakers. Conversing with others provides an opportunity not only to learn new words but also to practice using them in context. 6. Play word games: Games like Scrabble, Boggle, and crossword puzzles allow you to engage with words in a fun and challenging way. These activities can help reinforce your vocabulary knowledge and retention. 7. Use flashcards: Write new words and their meanings on index cards (or use a digital flashcard app) and review them regularly. This technique utilizes the concept of spaced repetition, which involves spreading out the learning and reviewing process over time to enhance memory retention. 8. Study etymology: Understanding the origins and histories of words can help you recall their meanings and recognize patterns within the English language. 9. Learn word families: Study groups of related words with a common root, such as \\"education,\\" \\"educate,\\" and \\"educational.\\" By learning words in groups, you can improve your understanding of their meanings and grow your vocabulary more efficiently. 10. Practice and repetition: Regularly review, practice, and use the new vocabulary you've learned. The more you use the words, the more they become a part of your long-term memory. It's important to remember that consistency and determination are crucial to vocabulary improvement. Employ a range of these techniques, and over time, you will see improvement in your English vocabulary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These letters shed new light on the predicament faced by the young princes during the great conflict of the early 20th century. Despite being the direct heir to the throne, Edward VIII, later known as the Duke of Windsor, was banned from active military service during the war, much to his despair. His younger brother, the future King George VI, was also unable to participate in the conflict due to health issues. Both princes, feeling neglected and left out of the great struggle of their time, took pen to paper and wrote to their military mentor to express their frustrations and the impact of the war on their personal and public lives. While many may assume that their royal status protected them from the horrors faced by ordinary soldiers during the war, these letters reveal the emotional turmoil these young men experienced when they found themselves unable to serve their country in such dire times. Edward VIII boldly admitted his envy for the soldiers fighting in the trenches and lamented the fact that he was left \\"totally devoid of any job\\" during the war. There was a deep feeling of frustration and guilt that haunted the prince as he struggled to come to terms with his lack of contribution to the war effort. For his younger brother, George VI, the constraints were physical. Suffering from chronic gastric problems, he was banned from serving by royal doctors who feared for his well-being. This, too, caused its own unique problems, with the prince worrying that the public would criticize him for not being on the front line and fighting alongside his fellow citizens. This fear of public backlash remained a constant source of stress for the prince, who felt both impotent and guilty for his inability to contribute directly to the war effort. But the royal brothers' contributions during the Great War cannot be overlooked. Although denied the opportunity to fight on the front lines, they played crucial roles in supporting the troops and the wider war effort back home. Edward VIII took up various administrative posts and public engagements, while George VI worked to overcome his stutter and became an important figure in bolstering morale both at home and abroad. Their commitment to their country and to the welfare of its citizens was palpable, despite the personal challenges they faced. It is important to recognize that the lives of the royal family, especially during times of war, are not as privileged and shielded as one might assume. They too faced pressure and anxiety as a result of their inability to participate in the conflict. These letters reveal the burden of responsibility that weighed on the royal brothers during World War I, a period that dramatically shaped their lives and the course of British history. The auctioning of these letters provides a fascinating insight into the turmoil, the loneliness and the frustrations of the future kings who felt left out in the midst of a war that consumed their nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ms Trierweiler went into hospital for a week suffering from shock. Mr Hollande was caught making late night visits to Ms Gayet, 41. Article:","output":"Title: Julie Gayet and François Hollande: A Breakup Caused by Heavy Pressure Introduction: In the wake of a high-profile breakup, Julie Gayet, the French actress involved in a relationship scandal with former French President François Hollande, has reportedly told friends that she was unable to cope with the pressure that came with the spotlight. The revelation comes after Hollande's split with his partner of ten years, Valerie Trierweiler, and Ms. Trierweiler's subsequent hospitalization due to shock. Reports have surfaced that Mr. Hollande was caught making late-night visits to Ms. Gayet, leading to the unraveling of events. Step 1: Introduce Julie Gayet's statement to friends Julie Gayet, the 41-year-old French actress known for her roles in French cinema, has allegedly expressed to her friends that she could not handle the immense pressure thrust upon her during her relationship with former French President François Hollande. The overwhelming attention and scrutiny from the media and public seem to have taken a toll on the actress, contributing to the ultimate demise of their relationship. Step 2: Discuss Hollande's split with former partner Valerie Trierweiler The pressure on Gayet began when Hollande split with his former partner of ten years, Valerie Trierweiler. The former first couple's separation in 2014 was already a significant event in French politics, and the subsequent discovery of Hollande's alleged affair with Gayet only amplified the attention on both women's lives. Step 3: Detail Ms. Trierweiler's hospitalization from shock Valerie Trierweiler, who had been Hollande's partner both before and during his presidency, went into the hospital for a week following Hollande's breakup and ensuing scandal with Gayet. The shock of the events that transpired took a significant toll on Ms. Trierweiler's mental well-being, amplifying the public scrutiny of the entire ordeal. Step 4: Describe Hollande's late-night visits to Gayet The affair between Hollande and Gayet garnered significant attention from French media outlets in 2014, with many speculating about the extent of their relationship. The interest was further ignited after Hollande was caught making late-night visits to Gayet, seemingly confirming the rumors of an affair and widening the spotlight on both parties involved. Conclusion: The pressure of being entangled in a high-profile relationship scandal with a former President proved to be too much for Julie Gayet. As details of the affair came to light, Hollande's breakup with his long-term partner, Trierweiler, and her subsequent hospitalization, the situation reached a boiling point. The public's insatiable curiosity and media scrutiny created an unbearable environment for Gayet, ultimately leading to the collapse of her relationship with Hollande."},{"instruction":"Question: What county is Farmington Hills, MI in??

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In one way of thinking, failure is part of life. In another way, failure may be a way towards success. The \\"spider-story\\" is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider making a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times. On the seventh time he made it and went on to make his web. Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \\"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question, \\"If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?\\" This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway. The third thing to keep in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to \\"live with yourself\\" even though you may have failed. Question: Even if we have failed we should   _  .

Erholung und Möglichkeiten zum Trainieren finden Sie kostenfrei im LivingWell Express Health Club, das rund um die Uhr geöffnet ist. Translate this to English?","output":"Relaxation and training opportunities can be found for free at the LivingWell Express Health Club, which is open 24 hours a day. Firstly, let's break down the content of the sentence. 1. \\"Erholung und Möglichkeiten zum Trainieren\\": This means \\"Relaxation and training opportunities\\". 'Erholung' is the German word for 'relaxation', and 'Möglichkeiten zum Trainieren' translates to 'opportunities for training'. This phrase indicates that the place being described offers facilities for both rest and exercise. 2. \\"finden Sie kostenfrei\\": Literally translated, this means \\"you find free of charge\\". 'Finden Sie' is German for 'you find', and 'kostenfrei' means 'free of charge'. This suggests that the services offered by the place are available for free, i.e., no charge is incurred by those who make use of them. 3. \\"im LivingWell Express Health Club\\": This translates to \\"at the LivingWell Express Health Club\\". 'Im' is a contraction of 'in dem', which means 'in the'. 'LivingWell Express Health Club' is the name of the location being referred to. Here, 'club' indicates that it is a place where people can come together to partake in collective activities, typically of a recreational or leisurely nature. 4. \\"das rund um die Uhr geöffnet ist\\": This means \\"which is open around the clock\\". 'Das' is a relative pronoun, equivalent to the English 'which'. 'Rund um die Uhr' literally translates to 'around the clock' and means 24 hours a day, suggesting that there are no time restrictions as to when one can visit.  Adding these segments together, an English translation of this sentence would be: \\"Relaxation and training opportunities can be found for free at the LivingWell Express Health Club, which is open 24 hours a day\\". This sentence tells us that the LivingWell Express Health Club offers facilities for exercise and relaxation that are free to use and are available at all times."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation? , can you please find it?   In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile as a work of the \\"ultimate psychedelic rock library\\". Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice...

Review: On an overnight flight from Los Angeles to Miami, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die. Red Eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The premise is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth but Red Eye is better than both of those films. Almost everything about Red Eye is above average including the suspense, the acting and the direction. Most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie. The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots. Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on the thrills, he focuses on the story and the characters. The movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about. I also like the way Wes Craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on. Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling. Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast. Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate. You may even end up cheering for her out loud. Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain. The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive. The supporting actors are also pretty good which include Brain Cox and Jayma Mays. The movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it. The setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape. Overall, the tone of the film is consistently creepy. The screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though. There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer. Most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head. Also, the ending is disappointing. It isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better. Since the movie focuses on the characters, there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps. If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed. In the end, Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer.

Both will have advantages for indoor gardens, so think about which kind is best for your purposes. Possible answers: [I] Yes [II] It's impossible to say [III] No Hypothesis: Growing tomatoes indoors is harder than outdoors","output":"After carefully reading the given paragraph, it's impossible to say if the hypothesis that growing tomatoes indoors is harder than outdoors is true. The paragraph primarily focuses on choosing a suitable variety of tomatoes for indoor gardens, presenting the options between determinate (bush) and indeterminate (vining) varieties. It discusses the advantages of both options for indoor gardens but does not provide information on the difficulty of growing tomatoes indoors in comparison to outdoors. In order to accurately determine if the hypothesis is true, we would require additional information on factors such as the differences in resources needed, lighting conditions, and potential challenges faced in both indoor and outdoor environments. Moreover, it is important to consider how different varieties of tomatoes could affect the ease or difficulty of growing them in either setting. For example, growing tomatoes indoors allows for more control over temperature and humidity, which could potentially make it easier to maintain optimal conditions for the plants. Conversely, outdoor environments may expose tomatoes to variable weather conditions, pests or diseases, which could make growing outdoors more difficult. On the other hand, indoor growing typically requires additional resources, such as artificial lighting systems and possibly heating or cooling systems, to replicate natural environments. This might make indoor growing more complicated compared to outdoor cultivation, where tomatoes are exposed to natural sunlight and temperature fluctuations. Lastly, the choice between determinate (bushing) and indeterminate (vining) varieties also plays a role in determining the ease or difficulty of growing tomatoes indoors or outdoors. Bush varieties tend to remain shorter and more compact in size, thus potentially making them more suitable for indoor environments where space is limited. On the other hand, vining varieties are more robust and can grow taller, making them potentially more suitable for outdoor growing conditions where they can utilize vertical space without overcrowding. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it's impossible to say if the hypothesis is true or false. We would need further details on various aspects of indoor and outdoor growing conditions, as well as how distinct tomato varieties perform in each setting, to make a more accurate determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Living far from a lake or a body of water limits the opportunities and frequency of using a boat, ultimately making it a less practical investment. In contrast, an ATV provides much more recreational value and functionality for people who reside in areas with diverse terrains and outdoor activities. An ATV, or all-terrain vehicle, is specifically designed to handle a wide range of surfaces and is capable of traversing dirt, mud, sand, and rocky terrains with ease, thanks to its robust suspension system and specialized tires. This makes an ATV a perfect choice for thrilling off-road adventures, exploring remote and rugged landscapes, or simply enjoying the great outdoors. Moreover, the compact size and impressive maneuverability of an ATV allow it to navigate narrow trails and even tight spaces that larger vehicles cannot access. Besides recreational purposes, ATVs are also quite useful for performing various tasks and chores, including hauling equipment, towing small trailers, and even plowing snow during winter. They can be equipped with numerous accessories, enhancing their functionality and customizing them according to specific needs. This further solidifies the ATV as a practical and valuable investment. On the other hand, a boat requires a body of water, like a lake, river, or sea, for it to serve its primary purpose of traversing and exploring waterways. Owning and operating a boat demands additional expenses, such as docking fees, maintenance, and potential storage costs during off-seasons. This can quickly add up, and without a nearby lake or river, the utility and enjoyment derived from owning a boat are severely curtailed. In conclusion, investing in an ATV offers far greater benefits and opportunities for adventure and utility when compared to a boat, particularly in situations where a person lives far from a lake or other bodies of water. The versatility, functionality, and adaptability of an ATV make it an ideal choice for those looking for an outdoor vehicle that can provide excitement, exploration, and practicality, regardless of the surrounding terrain or environment."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Margaret River murder-suicide: Seven people found dead at home near WA holiday town      Updated      Four children and three adults have been shot dead in a home near the West Australian town of Margaret River, in what is the nation's worst mass shooting since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre.      Key points: Police were tipped-off by a man connected to the property      Two adults were found outside the home, five bodies inside it, including four children      It is the worst mass shooting in Australia since Port Arthur in 1996      Police are treating the incident as a murder-suicide and have confirmed they are not looking for any suspects.      A friend of the family has confirmed to the ABC that Katrina Miles and her four children were among the seven victims.      The friend confirmed that Katrina's parents, whose names are listed on the property title as Peter and Cynda Miles, were also killed in the incident.      WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said all seven victims appeared to be residents of the property, which consists of an established house and a shed that had been converted to living quarters.      Two adults were found outside and the other five bodies were discovered inside the converted shed.      Police at the scene confirmed to the ABC that the family's next of kin had been notified, but they were yet to formally confirm the identities of the victims.      The mass shooting has the most fatalities since the Port Arthur massacre, in which 35 people died and another 23 were seriously injured.      Phone tip-off to police      Commissioner Dawson said officers were called to the rural property in Osmington, about 20 kilometres north-east of Margaret River, about 5:15am on Friday.

The bodies of three adults and four children and two guns were found at a rural property at the village of Osmington, Western Australia state Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said.      The bodies of two adults were found outside a building on the property and the rest were found inside. They all resided at the property, he said.      Police have no information to raise concerns about wider public safety. Police were led to the property by a phone call before dawn, Dawson said.      He would not comment on the possibility of murder-suicide.      \\"Police are currently responding to what I can only describe as a horrific incident,\\" Dawson told reporters.      \\"This devastating tragedy will no doubt have a lasting impact on the families concerned, the whole community and, in particular, the local communities in our southwest,\\" he added.      Police were attempting to make contact with victims' relatives, Dawson said. He declined to release the names or ages of the dead.      This could be the worst mass shooting in Australia since a lone gunman killed 35 in Tasmania state in 1996, prompting the nation to introduce tough gun controls.      Australia's gun laws are widely acclaimed as a success, with supporters including former President Barack Obama saying Australia has not had a single mass shooting since they were implemented.      The generally accepted definition of a mass shooting — four deaths excluding the shooter in a single event — has been met only once in Australia since then. In 2014, a farmer shot his wife and three children before killing himself.      Police have revealed few details about the recent killings, and it is not clear whether there was more than one shooter.      Farmers are allowed to own guns under Australian law because they have a legitimate need to use them to kill feral pests and predators or sick or injured livestock. But automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns are banned from public ownership. |||||Summary:","output":"Seven people, including four children, were found dead from gunshot wounds at a home near the town of Margaret River in Western Australia. Police believe it may be a murder-suicide and are not looking for any suspects. A phone call from someone connected to the property led the police to the scene. This is Australia's worst mass shooting since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, which resulted in strict gun control laws being implemented."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I am surprised at IMDb's low rating of this movie. With all due respect, its low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poor. They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget, and more gore. The first misconception by people is that this is a horror film. It is not, nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one. It is a psychological thriller. It is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. Reel.com's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- is something bad and not worth it. I will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense. Martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil Nazi who would kill without warning. The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing. I definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6's range on originality alone. I recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the IQ scale- aka smart people- since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. Kudos to the acting as well. For such a low budget film, you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction, writing, and acting. Please don't be fooled by the rating by IMDb. This movie is worth it. I actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice.

You can harvest and eat your onions at any phase of their growth, but they'll be larger if you wait until the end of summer when they're fully mature. Target onions with flowers on top first because they will rot if left in the ground. Onions that form flowers don’t store well and must be used within 3-4 days.  When an onion plant grows flowers, it’s a sign that the onion has stopped growing and the plant is now focusing its energy on the flowers. The growth of flowers on the top of an onion is known as “bolting” and is often seen as undesirable to onion growers.  You do not have to go through the curing process for onions that have grown flowers. Most onion plants will ripen sometime in the late summer. When the green foliage of the onion plant falls over on its side and turns yellow or brown, it’s a good sign that the onion is ready to be harvested. Use a spade to carefully dig a circle, 1 inch (2.5 cm) around the bulb. Dig around and under the bulb and sever the roots of the onion. Do not cut the onion with the spade because it will cause the onion to rot prematurely. Firmly grab the base of the green leaves and pull up to extract it from the ground. Loosen the soil with the spade more if you’re having trouble getting it out of the ground. Handle onions carefully so that you don’t bruise them. Bruising will cause rot.

The city of Bath is famous for its substantial Georgian architecture and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The people of Somerset are mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's entry for AD 845, in the inflected form \\"Sumursætum\\", and the county is recorded in the entry for 1015 using the same name. The archaic name Somersetshire was mentioned in the Chronicle's entry for 878. Although \\"Somersetshire\\" was in common use as an alternative name for the county, it went out of fashion in the late 19th century, and is no longer used possibly due to the adoption of \\"Somerset\\" as the county's official name after the establishment of the county council in 1889.

This architecture is often characterized by the use of Bath stone, a warm, honey-coloured limestone which contributes to the city's unique aesthetic. The city is also renowned for its Roman-built baths, which have drawn visitors for many centuries for their reputed healing properties. 3. There is evidence of human occupation in Somerset from Paleolithic times. This makes Somerset one of the longest continually inhabited regions in England, with a history stretching back at least hundreds of thousands of years.

In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a major cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract disease to which there is no vaccine or efficacious chemotherapeutic strategy. Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSVhost cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins. These data shed light into how the cell is potentially altered to create conditions more favorable for infection. Addition-ally, the study highlights the application and advantage of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS for the analysis of virus-host interactions.","output":"\\"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Proteomic Analysis and Effects on Host Cell Functions\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Acknowledge the positive in your life and begin to re-establish some balance in your emotional register. Avoid focusing on only the bad things that happened during your day, but consider the good as well.  Stop and count your blessings. Write down even the simplest things that you have and enjoy: a roof over your head, a bed to sleep on, quality food, warmth, security, good health, friends or family. Acknowledge that not everyone has these things. Say something positive to yourself as soon as you wake up every morning. This will keep your energy and mind focused on positive thinking. Be thankful for each day that you have; you never know which one could be your last! Use positive self-talk. Reinforce your resolve through positive statements such as, \\"I can handle this, one step at a time,\\" or \\"Since I've been successful with this before, there's no reason why I can't do it again.\\" Visualize positive things; this does not take long but can help you regain focus. Think about success, read about successful people.  Don't admit defeat before you've been defeated. You don't deserve to beat yourself down so that you can punish yourself. Set goals for what you need to achieve during the day, then write a \\"to do list\\". Add some breathing room in the middle of the day that will give you time to recharge. Taking control of your time and priorities will significantly decrease the amount of stress you feel.  Know your limits. Be realistic about what you can and can't accomplish in a day. It's not helpful if you bite off more than you can chew and then castigate yourself for not getting it done.  Prioritize your tasks. Work on finishing the highest priority (most urgent/important) items first. Put low priority items on the bottom of your list.  Try to avoid multi-tasking, as this can decrease focus. Instead, try to focus on important tasks and eliminate distractions.  Do your most unpleasant or most difficult task at the beginning of the day when you are fresh, thereby avoiding the stress of last minute preparation. Procrastination feeds stress! Emphasize quality in your work, rather than sheer quantity. Take pride in having done something well as opposed to having done a lot of something.  Schedule your day, if possible, so that stressful scenarios don't overlap, reducing the number of stressors you must juggle at any one time. Stagger deadlines for large projects. Review your goals at the end of the day and think about everything you have achieved. This is cathartic and will help you sleep better. Check off the things that you accomplished on the to do list. Make sure you understand why you become stressed so that you can try to avoid these circumstances. Knowledge is powerful, and self-knowledge is especially powerful.  If you notice, for example, that you regularly get stressed at a certain time with a certain person, go out of your way to prepare your brain for the upcoming stress. If the person is someone you love and trust, tell them how they make you feel in a non-threatening way. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your misgivings, remind yourself that the occasion is momentary, the feeling will pass, and you'll be in complete control soon. This especially comes with things such as politics, and often applies to other individuals. Learning to accept things as they are is an important coping mechanism, but not as easy as it sounds.  Is the problem a real problem you’re currently facing, rather than an imaginary what-if? If the problem is an imaginary what-if, how likely is it to happen? Is your concern realistic? Can you do something about the problem or prepare for it, or is it out of your control  Admitting to yourself that there's nothing you can do about a particular issue will go a long way in helping you adjust. Acknowledge that maybe you feed off of stress, like an adrenaline junkie feeds off adrenaline, but that in your case, it's becoming unmanageable. It is less stressful to make decisions and take action than to feel powerless and react to others' decisions. Decide what you want and go for it!   Learn to say no on occasion. You cannot do everything you are asked, and even if you could, you probably wouldn't want to. Resist the urge to be perfect at all times. Perfectionism can cause huge amounts of stress if you hold yourself to unattainable standards. Be realistic about what you can and can't do. Don't set yourself up for failure just because you want to stroke your ego. Don't get down on yourself for failing if you tried your hardest. You gave it your all, and nobody would ask you for more. Hold yourself accountable, but don't make being accountable impossible. Be one of your own best friends. It may sound cheesy, like something out of a Leave it to Beaver commercial, but it's true: Love yourself, depend (mostly) on yourself, and celebrate the things you do well. Loving yourself will ease the anxious question \\"Am I good enough?\\" and replace it with \\"I know I'm good enough.\\" One of the barriers to stress reduction is the temptation to take things too seriously. It's okay to back off from your intensity and see the humour in life's situations. Laugh a little or better yet, laugh a lot! See the humour in stress.  Learn to laugh at yourself. Don't put yourself down, or lash your self-esteem, but try to be playfully deprecating about yourself from time to time. How are you expected to laugh at other things if you can't even laugh at yourself? Help yourself learn to laugh by listening to some stand-up comedy throughout the day. This will help you cultivate humor and keep the tone of your day light. This is one of the most important things, as keeping things bottled up can only cause more stress. Your friends, if they are true friends, will try to understand what you're going through, and will accompany that empathy with a sincere desire to help out if at all possible.  Ask your friends for help. If you want something done but can't find the strength or the time to do it, it's okay to ask your friends or loved ones for help. Express your gratitude and extend the offer of help as a kind of reciprocity. Learn to delegate to help decrease stress. Look for people's respect, not approval — your friends included. Your friends will respect you because they love you, even if they don't always agree with you. Your enemies (if you have any) will respect you because your motivations come from a sincere, heartfelt place. Resist the urge to be loved and accepted by everyone; it's literally a Herculean task. You'll find yourself a lot less stressed and a lot more satisfied if you do. Seek out positive people rather than negative ones. It sounds like a truism because it is: Surrounding yourself with people who are fun-loving, excited, and kind will help you avoid the stress you'd be feeling with pessimistic, cynical, mean people. Nothing else helps intensify stress more than negative thoughts. When you start to having the feeling of defeat is the perfect time for a little reminder.  You know yourself better than anyone else, and you are the perfect person to give you the reminder that it will get better. Remind yourself of all of the things you have accomplished in the past.  All of those small accomplishments add up to very big ones over time. Change the words you use.  Instead of saying, \\"I can't do this,\\" say something like, \\"I've been able to get through this before, and I will get through it this time too.\\"","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive mindset, setting realistic goals, prioritizing tasks, avoiding multitasking, learning to say no, seeking support from friends, and surrounding oneself with positive people in order to reduce stress and achieve a balanced emotional state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Wildest Dream Movie plot: In 1924 mountaineer George Mallory was torn between love for his wife Ruth, and his obsession with the last great adventure left to man: becoming the first person to reach the summit of the untouched Mount Everest. Dressed in gabardine and wearing hobnailed boots, Mallory risked everything in pursuit of his dream, but was last seen alive 800 feet below the summit. Then the clouds rolled in and he disappeared. After discovering Malloryâs body on Everest in 1999, modern climber Conrad Ankerâs life became intertwined with Malloryâs story. Malloryâs frozen body was found with his belongings intact; the only thing missing was a photograph of Ruth, which Mallory had promised to place on the summit. Haunted by Mallory's story, Anker returns to Everest with British climbing prodigy Leo Houlding to discover the truth about Mallory and to unravel the mysteries surrounding his disappearance. Anker and his climbing partner take on the Second Step without the use of the fixed ladder; free climbing it with the use of some modern safety precautions (e.g. perlon rope, camming devices, belay devices), to evaluate if indeed Mallory was capable of climbing the Second Step himself in 1924.

By definition, dandelions are a type of flowering plant commonly found in many parts of the world. They are known for their yellow flowers that turn into spherical seed heads when mature. To find the ways dandelions reproduce, we can look up information about their reproduction methods. Upon research, we find that dandelions reproduce mainly through two ways: sexual reproduction (by producing seeds) and asexual reproduction (by vegetative propagation, sprouting new plants from their roots). Since there are two main methods of reproduction in dandelions, the appropriate number to fill in the blank is 2.

They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin. During the Sixth Crusade (1228– 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation. The Christians, however, could not hold the city. After they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions. Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times. In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East. Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517, remaining under their control for 400 years. Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day. Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed. But when Suleiman died, his empire, including Jerusalem, began a long period of decline. The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"A lot of Islamic art was created in Jerusalem.\\" correctly answer the question \\"What happened to Jerusalem after the Christians lost it?\\"?","output":"Yes, the response \\"A lot of Islamic art was created in Jerusalem\\" can be considered a correct answer to the question \\"What happened to Jerusalem after the Christians lost it?\\", but it only touches upon one aspect of the events that took place. After the Christians lost Jerusalem, it went through a series of changes in control and experienced various forms of development. Firstly, the Mongol invasion swept through the region, and then in 1244, the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. It was during this Mameluke era that much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed, which supports the response that a lot of Islamic art was created in Jerusalem. However, the city also struggled to rebuild from the Crusader wars and invasions, and it couldn't regain the prosperity it had in the past. In the early 16th century, Jerusalem fell under the control of the Ottoman Turkish Empire, which remained in power for 400 years. Suleiman the Magnificent contributed to the city's development by rebuilding the walls, gates, fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks. However, after his death, the empire, including Jerusalem, went into decline until renewed interest in the 19th century brought Christian pilgrims and travelers to the city. In conclusion, while the statement \\"A lot of Islamic art was created in Jerusalem\\" is accurate, it only provides a partial picture of what happened to the city after the Christians lost it. Other significant events, such as the Mameluke and Ottoman rule, the city's struggle to rebuild, and its eventual decline and resurgence, should also be mentioned for a more complete understanding of the city's history during that period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K.

Avrupa Birliği (AB) sağlık yetkilileri, Türkiye'de insanlarda görülen kuş gribi vakalarında gelecekte daha fazla artış yaşanabileceği konusunda uyarıyor. Bunun nedeni, hem Türkiye'nin kuş gribi virüsüne maruz kalan yaban hayatı ve kümes hayvanlarının yoğun olduğu bölgelerde bulunması, hem de ülkenin kümes hayvanlarıyla iç içe yaşayan yerleşim bölgelerinin oranının yüksek olmasıdır. Yetkililer, kuş gribi virüsünün yayılma hızı, insanların yerleşim alanlarında kümes hayvanlarıyla bir arada yaşamanın yaygın olduğu Doğu Türkiye'de özellikle kaygı verici olduğunu belirtiyorlar. Ayrıca, mevsimsel göç eden yaban kuşlarının bölgede kuş gribi virüsü H5N1'in yayılmasına neden olduğuna dikkat çekmektedirler. Bu bağlamda, yetkililer Türkiye'de kuş gribi vakalarını önlemeye yönelik olarak alınması gereken tedbirleri sıralıyorlar. İlk olarak, hastalığın yayılmasını kontrol altına almaya yönelik çalışmalar hızlandırılmalıdır. Buna ek olarak, kümes hayvanlarının kontrol altında tutulması ve gözetlenmesi önemlidir. Hükümet ve yerel yönetimlerin, yaban kuşlarıyla yaşayan insanlar arasında olası bulaşma riskini azaltmak için halk sağlığı bilgilendirme kampanyaları düzenlemesi ve hayvanların korunması için ilave tedbirler alması gerekmektedir. Ayrıca Türkiye, bölgesel ve uluslararası sağlık ve veterinerlik otoriteleriyle işbirliği yaparak, kuş gribi vakalarının kontrolleri ve izlenmesi konusunda güçlü ve sürekli bilgilendirme paylaşımını sürdürmelidir. Bilimsel araştırmalar ve uyumlu politikalar geliştirerek, ülke çapında kuş gribi ile mücadeleyi daha etkili hale getirilmesi hedeflenmelidir. Sonuç olarak, AB sağlık yetkilileri Türkiye'nin bu konuda önlem ve tedbirler alması gerektiğine dikkat çekerek, insanlarda kuş gribi riskinin daha fazla yayılmasının önünü kesmek için önemli adımlar atılması konusunda uyarıda bulunuyorlar."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a passage, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential signal mechanism of tissue factor (TF)xa0in the regulation of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells.', 'An in vitro RPE cell chemical hypoxia model was established by adding cobalt chloride (CoCl2) in the culture medium. The irritative concentration of CoCl2 was determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay kit. VEGF production in ARPE-19 cells was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting. The Wnt signaling pathway-associated molecules, including phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p-GSK3β), GSK3β, p-β-catenin and β-catenin, were detected with western blotting. pEGFP-N3-hTF was constructed and verified with digestion of the restriction enzyme and sequencing analysis. Human TF overexpression and silencing plasmids were transfected into the ARPE-19 cells to clarify the causal relationship between TF and VEGF expression. The Transwell coculture system of ARPE-19 cells and RF/6A rhesus macaque choroid-retinal endothelial cells was performed to evaluate cell invasion and tube formation ability.', 'Our anoxic model of ARPE-19 cells showed that TF expression was upregulated in accordance with variations in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) and VEGF levels. Silencing and overexpression of TF decreased and increased VEGF expression, respectively. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway played an important role in this effect. Results from the ARPE-19 cell and RF/6A cell coculture system showed that the enhancement of TF expression in the ARPE-19 cells led to significantly faster invasion and stronger tube-forming ability of the RF/6A cells, while siRNA-mediated TF silencing caused the opposite effects. Pharmacological disruption of Wnt signaling IWR-1-endo inhibited the effects compared to the TF-overexpressing group, indicating the importance of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the process of TF-induced VEGF expression and angiogenesis.

She nodded vigorously when I mimed the actions of a circumcision ( really , pretty easy when there 's naked baby boy in front of you ) .

He is a beautiful baby : small but not scrawny , with a perfectly round head , soft alert eyes and a little round nose . Question: Why would the baby be crying - even a little bit as the narrator mentioned ?","output":"The baby would be crying for a few reasons during and after the circumcision process. First, it is essential to understand that circumcision is a surgical procedure involving the removal of the foreskin that covers the glans (head) of the penis in male infants. While the procedure itself is relatively quick (usually lasting about 10 to 30 minutes), it can cause some degree of distress and discomfort for the baby. Here are some reasons why the baby might be crying during and after the procedure: 1. Pain: Circumcision is typically performed using a localized anesthetic applied either as a cream or an injection to reduce the sensations of pain that the baby might experience. However, the anesthetic may not completely eliminate all discomfort or sensations associated with the procedure. As a result, the baby could be crying due to the residual pain or discomfort that they are feeling during and after the circumcision. 2. Fear and anxiety: Even though a baby may not fully comprehend the situation or understand what is happening, they can still sense discomfort, fear, and anxiety. They may feel vulnerable or scared because they are held down and have been separated from their caregiver momentarily during the circumcision process. The unfamiliar environment, bright lights, and possibly being cold or feeling exposed may also contribute to the baby feeling uneasy, thus causing them to cry. 3. Trauma: The process of circumcision involves cutting and removing a part of the baby's body, which, in some cases, may result in a mild shock or trauma for the infant. This could lead to the baby crying, even after the circumcision has been completed. 4. Physical irritation: After the procedure, the newly exposed glans may experience some irritation as it is now exposed to elements (such as air, clothing, or contact with the diaper) that it hasn't come into contact with before. Additionally, there might be some minor bleeding or swelling, which could cause discomfort leading the baby to cry. 5. Hunger or desire for comfort: Infants often communicate their needs, such as hunger or the need for comfort, through crying. During and after the circumcision, the baby might simply be seeking comfort or food from their caregiver, which could be why they are crying. It is essential for healthcare providers and caregivers to ensure that the baby is comfortable and well-taken care of during and after the procedure to minimize distress. In the situation described, the baby might have cried less than others because the medical personnel were successful in keeping their distress to a minimum by effectively managing pain, providing a comfortable environment, and offering timely comfort and support."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What country was formerly known as Siam until June 23, 1939, and again from 1945 to May 11, 1949?","output":"The country formerly known as Siam until June 23, 1939, and again from 1945 to May 11, 1949, is Thailand. Thailand is a Southeast Asian country located at the center of the Indochinese Peninsula. It is bordered by Myanmar to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Cambodia to the southeast, and Malaysia to the south. Before its name change, Siam was a powerful and influential kingdom in the region. The Siamese people, their language, and culture are still evident today in modern Thailand. However, the name Siam was officially changed to Thailand in 1939 by the then-authorities, who wanted to unite the different ethnic groups living within the country under one national identity. The reasoning behind the name \\"Thailand\\" was to emphasize \\"Thai\\" – meaning \\"free\\" or \\"freedom\\" in the Thai language – and \\"land\\" to signify the country as the land of the free people. This was a declaration of the independent spirit of the Thai people. Thailand has a rich and complex history that has been shaped by numerous foreign influences and internal power struggles. The country's history can be traced back to the Dvaravati period (6th-11th centuries), followed by the Lavo Kingdom (11th-14th centuries) and the Sukhothai Kingdom (13th-15th centuries). The Ayutthaya Kingdom (14th-18th centuries) brought Siam to the height of its political power and influence, but it eventually fell to the Burmese invasion in 1767. Despite being colonized by the British and the French during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Siam maintained a considerable level of autonomy and freedom. In 1932, a bloodless revolution transformed the Kingdom of Siam into a constitutional monarchy, paving the way for a tumultuous political landscape characterized by military and civilian coups in the following decades. In World War II, the country was occupied by the Japanese forces, which led to the brief restoration of the name Siam in 1945, following Japan's defeat. However, by May 11, 1949, the name was again changed back to Thailand. Today, Thailand is a constitutional monarchy with King Maha Vajiralongkorn on the throne. It has a diverse and vibrant culture, a rich history, and is known for its breathtaking landscapes, ancient temples, and delicious cuisine. As one of the most popular tourist destinations in Southeast Asia, Thailand plays a crucial role in the economic and cultural dynamics of the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai.  The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who clashes with Robert? ?  Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.

Speaking at a regional security conference in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat said his nation is taking steps in the right direction while Washington fails to reciprocate, the New York Times reports. Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's minister of foreign affairs, said in a closed-door meeting that North Korea has taken steps toward denuclearization—like dismantling a nuclear test site and stopping nuclear tests—but America hasn't reciprocated by curbing sanctions or declaring the Korean War officially over. \\"The United States, instead of responding to these measures, is raising its voice louder for maintaining the sanctions against the DPRK,\\" he said in part. Ri was friendlier while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo remained at the conference, shaking his hand and exchanging pleasantries for a photo op, the Washington Post reports. \\"There are many productive conversations to be had,\\" Ri told him. Ri was also given a letter from Trump that followed up on a missive last week from Kim Jong Un (the contents remain private, but Trump recently tweeted thanks to Kim for \\"your nice letter\\" and added, \\"I look forward to seeing you soon!\\").

Speaking at a regional security conference in Singapore, Ri, who serves as the minister of foreign affairs, stated that North Korea has taken significant measures, such as dismantling a nuclear test site and halting nuclear tests, while Washington has yet to curb sanctions or officially declare the Korean War over. Though Ri had a cordial exchange with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the North Korean official accused the U.S. of raising its voice louder for maintaining sanctions against the DPRK. Pompeo later warned Russia against aiding North Korea in circumventing UN sanctions, while the UN revealed that North Korea has been using illicit means to skirt sanctions, including engaging a Syrian middleman to sell weapons to Libya and Yemen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Inside Man Movie plot: Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) speaks into a camera, recording a description of the crime he has taken part in. He says that he is \\"stuck in a tiny cell\\" (we see a small portion of this cell, and Dalton writing in a journal and doing push-ups), and that he recently executed a bank robbery. He describes the who (himself), the what (the robbery), the where (his current location in 'a tiny cell'), the when (recently) and the why (because he can). He says the only question remaining is how the robbery was completed.A man gets into a Chevrolet Express van parked next to the Coney Island Cyclone. The driver is shown driving through Brooklyn, making a streetside pickup for another painter. The van then enters Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge and picks up a final passenger in Chinatown, before parking the van outside a branch of the Manhattan Trust Bank at 20 Exchange Place near Broadway and Wall Street. The driver and passengers are dressed alike in painter's clothes.As employees and customers at the bank carry on their business, the painters begin to unload what appear to be paint and painting supplies onto hand carts. Dalton, who is one of the painters, walks into the bank, and we recognize him despite the clothes and dark. He places two large, high-intensity flashlights on one of the small service tables in the center of the bank's lobby. He turns them on and points them at two of the bank's security cameras, blinding them.The other painters follow him into the bank but nobody notices them locking the doors shut. When they raise their masks over their mouths and noses, a guard approaches and questions what they are doing. Dalton walks up behind him and puts a gun into his side. The other painters rush in, brandishing firearms and dropping smoke bombs, and subdue the other customers.A passing NYPD patrol officer, Sergeant Collins (Victor Collichio), happens to see smoke coming out from under the bank doors. When he attempts to open the doors, he finds they are locked and calls police dispatch. Dalton unlocks a door...

If blood is red, why are veins  blue? Actually, veins are not blue at all. They are more of a clear, yellowish colour. Although blood looks red when it's outside the body, when it's sitting in a vein near the surface of the skin, it's more of a dark reddish purple colour. At the right depth, these blood-filled veins reflect less red light than the surrounding skin, making them look blue by comparison. Which works harder, your heart or your brain? This question depends on whether you're busy thinking or busy exercising. Your heart works up to three times harder during exercise, and shifts enough blood over a lifetime to fill a supertanker. But, in the long run, your brain probably tips it, because even when you're sitting still your brain is using twice as much energy as your heart, and it takes four to five times as much blood to feed it. Do old people shrink as they age? Yes and no. Many people do get shorter as they age. But, when they do, it isn't because they're shrinking all over. They simply lose height as their spine  becomes shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity . Many (but not all) men and women do lose height as they get older. Men lose an average of 3-4 cm in height as they age, while women may lose 5 cm or more. If you live to be 200 years old, would you keep shrinking till you were, like 60 cm tall, like a little boy again?No, because old people don't really shrink!It is not that they are growing backwards--their legs, arms and backbones getting shorter. When they do get shorter, it's because the spine has shortened a little. Or, more often, become more bent and curved. Why does spinning make you dizzy ? Because your brain gets confused between what you're seeing and what you're feeling. The brain senses that you're spinning using special gravity and motion sensing organs in your inner ear, which work together with your eyes to keep your vision and balance stable. But when you suddenly stop spinning , the system goes out... Options: A Their spine is in active use. B They are more easily affected by gravity. C They keep growing backwards.

This article: The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W.... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910?, what is it ?","output":"The person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910, was Gustav Mahler himself. Mahler not only composed the Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major but also had the privilege to conduct its premiere performance.

Article: With smart phones taking the world by Storm, a phone that can only send and receive voice calls and text messages may seem like a relic from a bygone age. Yet in East Africa,simple phones like these are changing the face of the economy, thanks to the mobile money services that are spreading across the region.     Using the text-messaging function built into the GSM system used by most cell phone networks, these services allow people without a bank account or credit card to use their phone as an electronic wallet that can be used to store. send or receive cash.      It works like this: you pay cash to your local agent who then tops up your mobile money account using a secure form of text messaging. That money can be transferred to another person by sending a message to their cell phone account.      For some the system is a lifeline. \\"If I didn't have my mobile phone. I would be very poor, \\"says Neyasse Neemur, a mother of four children who lives in northern Kenya. \\"Now I can sell fish.\\"      Neemur took up fishing in July last year, but making money from it was a little tricky, especially as Turkana people do not usually eat fish. A truck from Ethiopia to Tanzania passes through her village once a week, and she arranged to have the driver transport the fish several hundred kilometres south to market in Kisumu, where her  s sell the fish.     \\"I get the money transfer immediately.\\" says Neemur. \\"Then I can pay for my children to go to school and for vegetables and beans,\\" she adds, \\"so I don't need to eat fish.\\"     According to the Central Bank of Kenya, payments worth around l billion Kenyan shillings(13 million)per day were transferred through Kenya's mobile money systems in 2009, equaling the country's credit card transactions .

The breaches were only discovered when the third recipient alerted the prison to the fact they had received a file. The ministry said the prison had altered its procedures since the incidents in August 2011. The fine was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After the data breach was reported an internal investigation was launched and the same error was found to have occurred on two previous occasions within the previous month, with details sent to different inmates' families. The ICO said neither incident was reported at the time. The emails about upcoming visits came from the prison clerk but also included a spreadsheet containing sensitive information including the names, ethnicity, addresses, sentence length, release dates and coded details of the offences carried out by all of the prison's 1,182 inmates. The ICO said police and a member of the prison staff were sent to visit the homes of those who had received the emails to check that the files had been deleted. The unauthorised disclosures were reported to the ICO on 8 September 2011. The ICO's investigation found that there was a clear lack of management oversight at the prison, with the clerk working unsupervised despite only having been at the prison for two months and having limited experience and training. A lack of audit trails also meant that the disclosures would have gone unnoticed if they had not been reported by one of the recipients, said the ICO. ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection David Smith said: \\"The potential damage and distress that could have been caused by this serious data breach is obvious. \\"Disclosing this information not only had the potential to put the prisoners at risk, but also risked the welfare of their families through the release of their home addresses. \\"Fortunately it appears that the fall-out from this breach was contained, but we cannot ignore the fact that this breach was caused by a clear lack of management oversight of a relatively new member of staff.\\" Furthermore, said Mr Smith, the prison service failed to have procedures in place to spot the original mistakes. \\"It is only due to the honesty of a member of the public that the disclosures were uncovered as early as they were and that it was still possible to contain the breach,\\" he added. The investigation also found problems with the manner in which prisoners' records were handled, with unencrypted floppy disks regularly used to transfer large volumes of data between the prison's two separate networks. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \\"We treat the security of information very seriously and took immediate steps to recover the data as soon as the loss was reported to ensure that it went no further. \\"These types of incidents are extremely rare but this does not mean that we are complacent. \\"A thorough investigation was held by the prison who immediately altered their procedures, and further changes were implemented across the prison estate.\\" Summary:","output":"A prison was fined by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for accidentally including sensitive information about its 1,182 inmates in emails meant for upcoming visits. The data breach was reported and an internal investigation was launched, revealing the error occurred twice before. The ICO found a lack of management oversight and inadequate procedures in place to spot mistakes. After the breach, the prison changed its procedures and recovered the data to prevent further issues.

The mechanic quickly diagnosed the problem with the muffler but couldn't figure out what was wrong with the alternator, because the problem with the","output":"alternator seemed to be intermittent and elusive. So, he decided to inspect the vehicle thoroughly to track down the root cause and fix it permanently. It had been a long day for the mechanic, with numerous vehicles passing through his workshop. But he was determined to resolve this problem. After checking the battery charge and ruling out any issues with the battery cables, he decided to examine the voltage regulator thoroughly, as it could also be a potential reason for the inconsistent power distribution. The meticulous inspection of the voltage regulator revealed that the wires seemed frayed and worn out. He figured that the damaged wires could cause power surges and dips as they sporadically lose connection to the alternator. The damages in the vehicle were far beyond this old mechanic's assumption. While he was under the hood, he noticed that some of the engine belts had visible cracks and showed signs of wear. He grabbed his notebook and jotted down some notes about belt replacement, alternator repair, and rewiring. He knew the customer would not be happy about the added cost to their service, but if these repairs were not made, the vehicle could easily break down in a short period. Knowing that he had potentially uncovered the source of the problem, he decided to perform one last test. He started the engine and monitored its functioning with a multimeter, checking for any inconsistencies in the voltage output. His suspicions were proved right: the voltage levels showed drastic fluctuations, thereby proving that the incomplete connection between the alternator and the voltage regulator was causing the alternator's sporadic performance. The mechanic heaved a heavy sigh because he knew that he would have to deliver this bad news to the customer. As a responsible professional, he knew it was his duty to convey these concerns to the vehicle owner. So, he invited the customer to his workshop, explained the situation in detail, and discussed the costs and options for repairs. The customer, visibly upset but understanding, begrudgingly agreed to move forward with the repairs. He replaced the damaged wiring and ensured the connections were secure. Next, he replaced the worn-out belts and installed a brand-new alternator. Though the job was tedious and time-consuming, the mechanic took pride in his work and delivered the completed vehicle to the customer. He provided all the necessary details: how the alternator would function at its best with the new wiring and the ups and downs of the voltage levels were gone. The customer listened intently and thanked the mechanic for his meticulous work. A few weeks later, the mechanic received a call from the customer conveying that the vehicle was running smoothly without any issues. The mechanic felt fulfilled and grateful for the kind words. As challenging as the repair was, he knew that his persistence and determination had paid off. This experience also provided him with valuable lessons which he shared with the other mechanics at the workshop. He emphasized the importance of thorough inspection, unbiased diagnosis, and honest communication with customers. The story of the elusive alternator problem became a shining example in the workshop and inspired the entire team to strive for excellence in their day-to-day tasks, ultimately benefiting their reputation and business."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

Investigators believe that the killers torched the vehicle to destroy any traces of evidence that may have been left behind after speeding away from the bar. The burnt-out vehicle was discovered by a local resident who alerted the emergency services, and the fire brigade was called to extinguish the blaze. Firefighters found the 4x4 charred and completely destroyed, making it difficult to retrieve any valuable information from the wreckage. However, the fact that the vehicle was set ablaze points to the high level of calculation and preparation by the culprits in covering their tracks. Suspicion has now turned to the mysterious woman who was by Kavanagh's side at the time of his murder. She has seemingly vanished without a trace since the incident, leaving investigators with more questions than answers. Witnesses described her as confident and alluring, sparking theories that she may have been a 'honey trap' used to isolate Kavanagh and make him an easy target. As detectives pore over Kavanagh's retrieved mobile phone, they hope to learn more about his final moments alive. The information on his phone would not only offer insight into the tangled web of lies and betrayals surrounding the victim's life but could also potentially hold critical evidence to solving the case. Key pieces of information such as call logs, messages, and GPS records could help officers unravel the truth behind the murder and perhaps even lead them to the identity of the perpetrators. The brutal slaying of Kavanagh has left many puzzled, as the gangland enforcer was known to be a feared and dangerous figure within the criminal underworld. Although not highly ranked, the reputation of 'Hatchet' was well established, making this targeted attack even more brazen and audacious. Police now speculate that the killing has all the hallmarks of a professionally orchestrated hit - perhaps done by rival gang members or even someone from his own organization. As the story unfolds, the Costa del Sol residents and Irish tourists alike anxiously watch as law enforcement pieces together the puzzle surrounding Gerard 'Hatchet' Kavanagh's death. One thing is for sure: the beaches and nightclubs of the popular Spanish resort are now tainted with the ever growing shadow of gangland violence. The once tranquil haven for holidaymakers has transformed into a breeding ground for criminals, lured by the sun-soaked beaches and lucrative rewards associated with drug smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime. Ultimately, the investigation must move quickly in order to catch those responsible for the ruthless murder of Kavanagh and prevent any further bloodshed. If left unchecked, the violence might escalate, resulting in an even more deadly and dangerous situation for both tourists and residents on the picturesque Costa del Sol. As authorities race against time to solve the case, it remains evident that the events unfolding on these sun-kissed shores are far from idyllic."},{"instruction":"In this task, you will be shown an English sentence.

Summarize the following: It is essential to get a checkup at your vet before your travel in order to receive a health certificate, often required for airline travel, and proof of vaccination. Many transportation services open to the public (trains, planes, boats) require a health certificate and proof of vaccination before agreeing to transport your dog.  Carry all of your dog’s documentation with you while you are travelling to avoid any issues with veterinary border control or emergency illnesses. Depending on where you're traveling, your pet's health certificate may need to be issued no earlier than 10 days before your travel date. While you're at the vet, be sure to stock up on all necessary medications. If you are flying or driving to another country, be sure to check for their immigration and veterinary border control policies. Contact the airline you are traveling with as well as the border control for the country you will be arriving in to find out what restrictions and laws you need to abide by.k  Some countries will require your dog to have specific vaccinations. They may also require your dog to be quarantined for a certain amount of time upon arrival at their border. Consult the airline you are travelling with to be put in touch with veterinary border control. Some airlines will not transport certain dog breeds, and some airlines won't fly dogs in extreme heat or cold. Crating your dog is recommended for both their and your safety. Before crating, be sure to exercise your dog so that they are more comfortable resting. Go for an extra long walk or run before putting your dog in the car or arriving at the airport. Whether you are driving or flying you’ll eventually need to find a dog-friendly hotel. Ask your hotel what their pet policies are when you are booking.  Some hotels charge extra for animals, and some have breed and size restrictions. Bring extra waste bags and wipes in case your dog has an accident at the hotel. Find out if your accommodation is near a park, lake, trail, or field that you and your dog can walk to for exercise and bathroom breaks. It comes in handy for cuts, ticks and the like. It will give you peace of mind if nothing else! Make sure your kit also includes any medications that your dog might need. Emergency kits should contain all of your dog’s relevant paperwork, a nylon leash, muzzle, and various medical supplies like hydrogen peroxide, gauze, bandages, tweezers, and adhesive tape. Sedating your dog can often cause unwanted complications as most sedatives will reduce your dog’s response to pressure and climate changes. Instead of sedating your dog, be sure to give them plenty of exercise before crating and have drinking water close by. Consult your vet if you are concerned that your dog may be in need of a sedative or tranquilizer while travelling.","output":"Before you travel with your dog, you need to visit the vet to get a health certificate and proof of vaccination, because trains, planes, and boats usually need to see these papers.

While at the vet, get any medicines your dog may need. When traveling, put your dog in a crate for safety. Be sure to exercise your dog well before you start traveling, so they feel comfortable in the crate. Choose a hotel that allows dogs and ask about their pet rules. Bring extra bags and wipes for your dog in case of accidents. Also, it's good to know if there's a park or a place nearby for your dog to play and go to the bathroom.

Chocolate is recession proof because we turn to it as a treat. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Low-Cost Chocolate Treats: A Recipe for Thriving Through Recession Introduction Every now and then, the hope of recovery from a recession is dampened by the fear of economic nosedives. Amidst these uncertain times, market research firm Mintel sheds light on the significance of low-cost chocolate treats in aiding consumer spending during a recession. In this article, we will discuss why chocolate is considered recession-proof, how low-cost chocolate treats can stimulate spending and what this means for the confectionery industry. The Recession-Proof Nature of Chocolate Chocolate has often been fondly regarded as a 'comfort food'. The time-tested treat has a rich history of lifting moods and providing solace in times of despair. According to Mintel, chocolate is recession-proof because it caters to our inherent need for indulgence during stressful periods. As the economic landscape becomes more turbulent, consumers are likely to seek affordable ways to treat themselves, and chocolate steals the show as the perfect low-cost treat. Low-Cost Treats Stimulating Consumer Spending In difficult economic times, household budgets tend to tighten, and consumers prioritize their spending. Low-cost chocolate treats offer a delectable reprieve and a luxury experience at a fraction of the price compared to other indulgences. This encourages consumers to allocate more of their discretionary income towards confections, thereby boosting overall spending. When higher-end, luxury chocolate becomes less affordable for a significant share of the population, low-cost treats gain the spotlight. Mintel's observations highlight that these affordable treats will drive an increase in consumer spending. The behavior is reminiscent of the lipstick effect, a phenomenon observed in previous recessions where consumers are inclined to purchase small luxuries even in times of economic downturn. Furthermore, low-cost chocolate treats are scalable and easily accessible. They cater to consumers across a broad range of income levels without any compromise on quality or taste. Simple bars and bites that delight the senses speak to a sense of communal enjoyment and nostalgia. This mass appeal, coupled with keeping costs low, ensures that the demand remains strong, encouraging consumer spending and mitigating the impact of recessions on the confectionery industry. Thriving Confectionery Industry Amidst Recessions Mintel's insights on low-cost chocolate treats' impact on consumer spending can be pivotal for the confectionery industry during recessions. By focusing on delivering quality chocolate products at affordable prices, companies can leverage the recession-proof nature of chocolate while expanding their consumer base. Investing in research and development to craft cost-effective chocolates without compromising on taste and experience is essential for confectionery companies. This will not only lead to increased sales but also nurture brand loyalty and repeat purchasing even during economic hardships. Additionally, confectionery companies should consider targeted marketing campaigns that highlight the affordability and quality of low-cost chocolate treats. Creative campaigns appealing to the emotional and comforting aspects of these treats can provide consumers with a much-needed break from challenges posed by a recession. Conclusion The fact that chocolate treats are recession-proof offers hope to consumers and the confectionery industry alike during economic downturns. The key to thriving through a recession relies on providing low-cost, yet delightful chocolate treats that fulfill our innate need for indulgence. By recognizing this, confectionery companies can enhance consumer spending, garner loyalty and ultimately ride the wave of recession with greater resilience and confidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts. The answer is:","output":"The first name of the person referred to in the context, who's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh, is Thomson. However, please note that Thomson is his last name, the context does not provide his first name.

Use the information from the story, along with any identified scenarios, to determine the location where Logan would look for the pineapple. 6. Write down the answer based on your understanding of the story and the question. In this case, the story goes like this: 1. Aria entered the pantry. 2. Logan entered the pantry. 3. The pineapple is in the blue_bathtub. 4. Logan exited the pantry. 5. Aria moved the pineapple to the blue_suitcase. Question: Where will Logan look for the pineapple? To answer this question, we must consider what Logan knows about the pineapple's location. When Logan was last in the pantry, the pineapple was in the blue_bathtub. He does not know that Aria has moved the pineapple to the blue_suitcase. Therefore, Logan's belief doesn't match the reality. This situation falls into the second scenario, where the individual's belief does not match reality. Based on what Logan knows, he will look for the pineapple in the blue_bathtub."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: \\"What proportion of Greece's energy was from renewable sources in the year that was before 2009?\\"  Context: \\"In 2008 renewable energy accounted for 8% of the country's total energy consumption, a rise from the 7.2% it accounted for in 2006, but still below the EU average of 10% in 2008. 10% of the country's renewable energy comes from solar power, while most comes from biomass and waste recycling. In line with the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. In 2013 and for several months, Greece produced more than 20% of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants. Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation, however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"In 2008, Greece sourced 8% of its total energy consumption from renewable sources. This marked an increase from the 7.2% figure in 2006 but still remained below the European Union's average of 10% for the same year. Among the various renewable sources, solar power contributed 10% to Greece's renewable energy mix, while the majority of the produced energy came from biomass and waste recycling. Driven by the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece set an ambitious target to achieve 18% of its energy generation from renewable sources by the year 2020. This goal demonstrates the country's commitment to promoting clean and sustainable energy practices, reducing its dependence on fossil fuels, and aligning itself with global climate change initiatives. In 2013, Greece made significant progress in increasing its renewable energy production. For several months that year, over 20% of the electricity generated in the country came from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants. This demonstrated the nation's potential to not only meet but also exceed its renewable energy targets. At present, Greece does not have any operational nuclear power plants. Nonetheless, the Academy of Athens in 2009 encouraged research into the possibility of constructing Greek nuclear power plants. This suggestion may have been influenced by a desire to further diversify Greece's energy portfolio and explore alternative, low-carbon energy sources that can help the country achieve its sustainability and energy security goals. In summary, by focusing on renewable energy sources such as solar power, biomass, and waste recycling, Greece made strides in adopting sustainable energy practices and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. While 8% of the country's total energy consumption came from renewable sources in 2008, the Greek government remained committed to its target of achieving 18% by 2020 and continues to explore the feasibility of incorporating nuclear power into its long-term energy strategy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Syd studied plate tectonics and mantle melting. His brother Dan got to study types of soil and pedology.  and a hint : Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.  Please answer this question : Which brother studied more about rising temperatures influencing mantle melting?

The reason lies in the different elements present in both the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states the following: 1. The speaker is asking if someone has tried growing fruits and vegetables. 2. The speaker is specifically enquiring about growing these plants indoors, using pots or other containers. On the other hand, the hypothesis focuses on the following aspects: 1. The speaker is again asking if someone has tried planting fruits and vegetables. 2. However, here, the focus is explicitly on growing these plants in a garden. Although both the premise and the hypothesis are centered on growing fruits and vegetables, the environments in which they are referring to the plants being grown are different. The premise concerns indoor cultivation, possibly with limited space and using pots or containers. In contrast, the hypothesis refers to outdoor cultivation in a garden.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. This article: During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that needed a quiet corner to rest his aching head?, what is it ?

People have various reasons for not wanting to attend social gatherings, and avoiding large groups might be one of them. This answer seems plausible, especially considering the fact that large gatherings can trigger various emotions in people, such as social anxiety, fear of judgment, or simply being overwhelmed due to the number of people present. Kai's preference for not attending the party could stem from a myriad of reasons, such as being an introvert, experiencing discomfort in crowded social settings, or even being sensitive to loud noises typically associated with parties. Moreover, Kai could also be concerned about the health risks attached to attending a gathering with a considerable number of people, particularly in light of the ongoing global pandemic. Suppose Kai's intention of not attending the party is truly to avoid a large group.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Seven Hours With Warren The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting was a classic example of shareholder meeting as farce. Incredibly, the seven-hour session before a record crowd of 30,000 had barely a mention of the financial crisis impacting markets worldwide for a year. There were more questions about the dams on Oregon's Klamath River shutting off the salmon run for Indian tribes than the damming up of the credit markets. The word \\"recession\\" was never mentioned. \\"Inflation\\" only once. No one asked about the 1.6 billion loss Berkshire took on a derivative position in the last quarter. Not a soul inquired about the decline in Berkshire's earnings. Buffett's brilliant call in buying Brazilian currency (the real) never got a nod, even though Standard & Poor's raised that nation's credit to investment grade last week. Nor did anyone raise the provocative theme put forth in Buffett's letter to shareholders (See \\"Croesus, Buffett: New Advice From On High\\") that investors should not expect to earn on their common stock positions the modest 5.3% rate of return earned during the whole of the 20th century. Were none of the 30,000 shareholders alert enough to take the opportunity to ask Buffett what rate of return they could expect? After all, many small investors count on their Berkshire holdings as an important stake and nest egg. \\"Anyone who wants us to repeat the past should sell [his or her] stock,\\" said the Oracle of Omaha, without any follow-up questions from alarmed shareholders. Be fairly warned. This passivity cannot be due to Buffett's willingness to appear on a certain cable network nine times and another one five times since October 2007. This was a chance blown to find out how Buffett and Munger weighed the risks in the world. It was Buffett's acerbic partner Charles Munger who finally exclaimed that \\"we are having convulsions that make Enron look like a tea party. We will have changes in regulation but they won't work perfectly.\\" No one asked Munger what changes he saw on the horizon. Later on the 84-year-old Los Angeles lawyer described the convulsion as \\"a huge dislocation that was very extreme but very brief. It's interesting how brief these opportunities are.\\" Nevertheless, Berkshire was able to accumulate a 4 billion position in auction rate notes when that market froze up some weeks ago. It included the short-term debts of the nonprofit Los Angeles County Museum of Art at interest rates of 8% to 10%--triple the 3% to 4% the same notes sold for in January. Perhaps it was this opportunity that Munger chose to describe in his no-holds-barred style--\\"some idiot hedge fund bought municipal bonds on incredible margin. These things were disposed on a margin call,\\" meaning that the fund had to sell because it didn't have the capital to support its position. After a lunch break, Buffett finally got in some licks at the regulator of Fannie Mae (nyse: FNM - news - people ) and Freddie Mac (nyse: FRE - news - people )--Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight--for allowing accounting irregularities to go on for some time. Buffett, who describes himself as \\"the chief risk officer\\" of Berkshire, also slammed the large commercial and investment banks as both too big to manage and too big to fail, according to the government. He reckoned that the failure of Bear Stearns (nyse: BSC - news - people ) would have caused the failure of \\"another investment bank or two going down in a day or two.\\" The panic would have been caused by financial institutions \\"trying to undo 14.5 trillion [worth of] derivatives contracts in just hours, not days or weeks. Hardly anyone caught Buffett side-kick Munger muttering that \\"to some extent it's an evil culture.\\" The evil culture he was talking about was Wall Street, the commercial and investment banks who had no idea that their risk models were utterly useless. \\"They didn't have the faintest idea what risks were involved,\\" he said. As for politics, Buffett, a Democrat, said all three candidates are intelligent. But he scoffed at the way both Clinton and Obama \\"ask for an excess profits tax on Exxon\\"--but not on the farmers getting rich off the boom in commodity prices. Munger added that \\"while we don't like inflation because it's bad for our country, we'll probably make more money over time because there is inflation.\\" On oil prices, Buffett predicted that production will level off and then start to decline, which will tend to put a floor under the price of oil. His politically incorrect partner Munger declared that \\"in the 1930s [when oil was first discovered in the Middle East] we should have taken the oil out of the Middle East and put it in the ground\\" in the U.S. \\"Eventually,\\" Munger predicted, \\"we'll have to use the sun for our power.\\" On a lighter note, the high point of the meeting was a cartoon film that had Munger being elected president on the Financially Independent ticket--and naming Buffett secretary of commerce, secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Federal Reserve all at once. In a serious vein, Buffett later said his inclination would be to raise taxes on the super-rich (himself included, of course) and lower them on the middle class, a position shared by both of the Democratic candidates. As for the stock market, Buffett, made it crystal clear that \\"Charlie and I haven't the faintest idea where [it's] going.\\" More from Croesus in Omaha Sunday. Stay tuned.

Summary:","output":"The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting attended by 30,000 saw an absence of discussion on the financial crisis and decline in the company's earnings. CEO Warren Buffett expressed concerns about the large commercial and investment banks, describing them as \\"too big to manage and too big to fail\\". He predicted oil production would level off, while futuristically considering the use of solar power.

Summarize: Chicks need plenty of protein, which is found in the starter feeds. The starter feeds also offer other nutrients and vitamins that enable the chicks to grow into healthy, fully-grown quail.  Use long, straight troughs for brooding chicks. Transition to circular feeders after the chicks are 2 weeks old. Use a smaller bowl for water. Chicks can eat fine crumble until they are 6 to 8 weeks old. A coarser texture, or pellets, are better for older quail. When raising chicks, teach them how to drink by dipping their beaks into the bowl/dish. If they have their mother hen with them, this is not much of a worry as she will show them how to drink. The best feed for quail is a game bird feed that has at least 20 percent protein or more. Quail feed is expected to have plenty of protein to enable them to have a balanced diet for them to grow into great, healthy pets.  If you are planning on using the quail for their meat, you do not need to give them a developer feed. Give them a finisher feed instead. If you are going to use your quail for breeding or laying eggs, slowly transition them to the new diet before they hit 10 weeks of age. Layer-pellets provide enough calcium for your quail to lay strong, healthy eggs. Make sure to grind the pellets up a bit if you find the quail quite big for them. This is especially important if you buy chicken pellets, as these are bigger than the quail layer-pellets. Just make sure you don't grind them up into a powder. Clean the water bowl one to three times a week and refill once a day. The bowls will tend to get dirty, as the quail will often stand in them, spill dirt/bedding in them and do all-sorts!","output":"To raise healthy quail chicks, provide them with starter feeds containing high protein and essential nutrients.

Summarize the following: These aren’t absolutely necessary to sell a print version of your comic book, but they make distribution and retail much simpler. An ISBN number identifies your book by the title, cover and page number while the barcode allows it to be scanned. This gives you the option to sell your books in stores, be they online or brick and mortar. While any version of a comic book will need a cover, it’s especially important for printed comic books. You can draw and design your own cover, or you can collaborate with other artists for a different look. If you decide to stick to selling in online stores, the cover will be crucial for identifying your book, especially if you’ve bought an ISBN number. You can research print-on-demand companies to choose the one that benefits you. However they all work in essentially the same way; they handle the printing for you and only print copies as they’re ordered. This means you won’t have to hoard hundreds of copies of your comic book and ship them out yourself. The important thing to keep in mind is comparing the cost of this service to the advantages. A proof copy is a printed version of your book that you can review for errors before your comic goes to print. You’ll likely have to pay a fee, but you’ll get a good idea of what your comic book is going to look like when your readers order it. You might find that certain design choices that look good on a computer screen don’t look as good in print, and you can review them before the comic book is in the hands of your readers. While you’ll find comic books from major publishers on store shelves, it’s more difficult for independent comics to break into the same distribution networks. Instead, market to your readers directly. You can use an online platform like Amazon to handle the actual transaction and shipping; use social media and traditional networking to get your book out where readers can see them.  If you want to deal with your readers directly, you can use an online marketplace such as Etsy to sell to them directly. You’ll need to handle the shipping of the comics yourself however. A popular method of marketing comic books is buying a table at comic book conventions. There you can sell your books in person and offer autographed versions. Summary:","output":"To streamline the distribution and retail process of selling a print version of your comic book, consider acquiring an ISBN number and barcode, which enable selling in both physical and online stores. A well-designed cover is crucial for printed comic books, as it helps identify your book. Utilize print-on-demand companies to handle printing and shipping, while comparing their costs to the benefits of their service. Review a proof copy of your book for any errors or design choices before heading to the final print. As independent comics face challenges in distribution networks, use platforms like Amazon, Etsy, or market directly through social media and traditional networking methods. Attending comic book conventions is also an effective way to market your comic books and interact personally with potential readers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: COLUMBUS, Ohio--The heart operation taking place in the pale-green operating room at the Ohio State University Medical Center was unusual. The patient, a 62-year-old man, was made to sleep, tied with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms went through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with turning wrists, which held a tiny instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. \\"The reason we make cuts is that we have big hands,\\" said Dr. Wolf, the director of the surgery at Ohio State. The robot's _ fingers, no longer than a nail on the small finger, at the end of the long sticks could work better. Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are put in through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests. Instead of directly staring into a patient's body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as the patient. According to the passage, the reason that most operations require large cuts is that   _  .

Options: - drunkenness - arrest - fall down - regret - vomit  Explain why a human would choose \\"arrest\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"arrest\\" as the answer to the question because it best describes the likely response of the authorities in such a situation. When a person becomes inebriated and starts a fight, they are typically exhibiting aggressive and dangerous behavior, which poses a risk to themselves and others around them. The options provided each represent different aspects or consequences of intoxication, but \\"arrest\\" is the most directly related to the involvement of the authorities. Let's analyze each option in detail: 1. Drunkenness: This option describes the state of being intoxicated, which is the root cause of the scenario. While this is relevant, it does not answer the question regarding the authorities' response to the situation. 2. Arrest: This option implies that the authorities, such as the police, would intervene to restore order and ensure public safety. By arresting the person who started the fight, they would aim to deescalate the situation and hold the individual accountable for their actions. Given the context of the question, this is the most appropriate answer. 3. Fall down: Falling down is a potential consequence of inebriation, as impaired coordination and balance can lead to accidents. However, this does not address the aspect of the question referring to the response of the authorities. 4. Regret: Regret is a feeling that can occur after a person has become sober and realized the negative consequences of their actions while intoxicated. While this emotional response may be relevant for the individual involved in the fight, it does not provide any insight into how the authorities would handle the situation. 5. Vomit: Vomiting is another possible consequence of excessive alcohol consumption, but like falling down and regret, it does not directly pertain to the authorities' response to the situation. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"arrest\\" to answer the question because it accurately portrays the most plausible action that authorities would take in the event of an inebriated person starting a fight. The remaining options, while related to various aspects of intoxication, do not effectively address the role of the authorities in dealing with such a situation. Arresting the individual serves the purpose of maintaining public safety and holding the person accountable for their actions, making \\"arrest\\" the most appropriate answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I think that all starts with being active.' Kate has also released an accompanying fashion range of fitness clothing which she says is functional and flattering for women of all shapes and sizes.

Step 2: Talk to Ryan's friends and family Next, Samuel reached out to Ryan's close friends and family members to gain insight into Ryan's preferences and any specific requirements he might need from a new computer. This could provide valuable information that Samuel wouldn't be able to gather on his own. Step 3: Observe Ryan's current computer usage Samuel also spent some time observing how Ryan uses his current computer and noticed if there are any particular features that Ryan frequently used or mentioned needing. This could give Samuel clues about the ideal features that Ryan might appreciate in a new computer. Step 4: Research and compare various computer models Having gathered as much information as possible, Samuel began researching different computer brands and models on the market. He compared the features, specifications, and prices of various models, keeping Ryan's preferences and needs in mind. Samuel also read customer reviews and gathered feedback from online forums to ensure he was making an informed decision. Step 5: Make a list of top choices Based on the research, Samuel shortlisted a few computer models that best matched Ryan's preferences. He listed down the pros, cons, and prices of each model, preparing to make his final decision. Step 6: Seek advice from experts Before making the final decision, Samuel consulted with a few computer experts to get their opinions on his top choices.

Step 8: Present the gift to Ryan Excited to give Ryan the computer, Samuel planned a small gathering with close friends and family to surprise Ryan with the gift.

Jennifer is more artistic.","output":"Kayla loves to play sports, but Jennifer really can't stand it because Jennifer is more artistic (Option B). The sentence above highlights the differences between Kayla and Jennifer's preferences regarding physical activities and their personal interests. While Kayla is passionate about playing sports, Jennifer does not share the same enthusiasm, as her interests are more inclined towards the artistic domain. Individuals possess a diverse range of hobbies and passions, and their preferences often determine their personalities and the choices they make in their lives. Kayla's inclination to play sports could be due to various factors, such as her natural athletic abilities, the excitement of competition, the feeling of accomplishment, or her dedication to maintaining physical fitness. On the other hand, Jennifer finds her joy and purpose in artistic pursuits and does not derive the same pleasure from sports activities. Jennifer's love for art may stem from her creativity, emotional expression, or simply her aesthetic sense. Art provides her with a platform to explore her imagination and to share her thoughts and feelings with others. Moreover, art has therapeutic qualities that allow Jennifer to relax, unwind and immerse herself in a world that speaks to her on a deeper level. Consequently, she may find sports taxing or uninteresting, as they do not offer her the same mental and emotional rewards that she receives from engaging in artistic endeavors. Both Kayla and Jennifer are quite distinct in terms of their likes and dislikes. Nevertheless, their differences open up opportunities for them to learn from each other and to respect the unique qualities that make them who they are. While sports and art may initially seem at odds with each other, they are, in fact, complementary in many ways. Sports can teach values such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, while art nurtures self-expression, creativity, and introspection. Embracing and valuing these differences can lead to a more enriching, balanced, and fulfilling life experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does the sentence \\"Bohemia (as Czech civilization was known by then) increased in power over the centuries, as its language did in regional importance.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did Jan Hus advocate for among the Czech commoners?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"Bohemia (as Czech civilization was known by then) increased in power over the centuries, as its language did in regional importance.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did Jan Hus advocate for among the Czech commoners?\\".  To provide a detailed and long answer to the question regarding Jan Hus' advocacy, let us first understand who Jan Hus was and the context of his actions. Jan Hus (1369-1415) was a Czech priest, philosopher, theologian, and reformer, who later became an influential figure in the history of Christianity and Bohemia. Jan Hus is best known for his efforts to reform the practices and beliefs of the Catholic Church, which led to his excommunication and eventual execution by burning at the stake. During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, there was a growing dissatisfaction among the people of Bohemia, including the Czech commoners, with the corruption and hierarchy within the Catholic Church. The Church was plagued by financial abuses, immorality among the clergy, and the lack of effective spiritual leadership. In this context, Jan Hus emerged as a seminal figure calling for much-needed changes. Though Jan Hus was influenced by the English reformer John Wycliffe, he developed his own ideas that addressed the unique challenges of the Czech church and society. Some of the key advocacies of Jan Hus among the Czech commoners were: 1. Elimination of corruption and financial abuses in the Church: Jan Hus called for the reduction of the wealth and worldly power of the clergy. He argued that such wealth corrupted the Church and stood in the way of spiritual growth. This resonated with the Czech commoners who felt exploited by the Church's financial demands. 2. Encouragement of the use of the Czech language in liturgy: Jan Hus advocated for the use of the vernacular (Czech) language in religious services, making them more accessible and understandable to the commoners. This was significant because, at that time, Latin was the exclusive language used in the Church administration and liturgy, which effectively alienated common people from participating in their own spiritual life. 3. Communion under both kinds - bread and wine: Jan Hus promoted the administration of the Holy Eucharist in both forms (bread and wine) to all believers, not just the clergy. This practice was a way to emphasize the equality of all Christians before God and reduce the hierarchical divide between the clergy and the laity. 4. Importance of personal piety and Bible study: Hus believed that individuals could access God's truth through their own conscience and by studying the Bible directly, rather than relying solely on the interpretation of the Church's clerical hierarchy. This encouraged Czech commoners to seek a more personal and direct relationship with God. While the sentence provided does not answer the question directly, it is important to acknowledge that Jan Hus' advocacy did contribute substantially to the empowerment of the Czech language, culture, and ultimately the influence of Bohemia in the region. Moreover, his reforming actions planted the seeds for the eventual emergence of Protestantism in Europe and the broader religious transformations that took place during the 16th century Reformation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Time is considered to be the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works.

Q: In this task, you're given an article and an answer. Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Article: What does the word \\"home\\" mean to you? How do you say the word in French? In Spanish? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means, it often has no exact translation. It's not surprising really, because the idea of home differs from country to country, and from person to person. A home is more than a roof and four walls. It's the cooking, eating, talking, playing and family living that go on inside, which are important as well. And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed. But it's not just that homes look different in different countries, they also contain different things and reveal  different attitudes and needs. For example, in cold northern Europe, there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it. In the south, where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out, there are small windows, cool stone floors and often no carpets. We asked some people about their homes.

Translate \\"Both were romans à clef based on the radical adventures of Bernstein, Guy Debord, and their lovers and comrades.\\" to German?","output":"Step 1: First, let's break the sentence down into simpler components so we can ensure an accurate translation. \\"Both were romans à clef\\" is the first component, meaning they are novels that represent real-life events or characters under the guise of fiction. \\"Based on the radical adventures of Bernstein, Guy Debord, and their lovers and comrades\\" is the second component. Here we are describing what these novels are based on. Step 2: Now let's begin to translate each component: For \\"Both were romans à clef\\", in German, it would be \\"Beide waren Schlüsselromane\\". \\"Both\\" translates to \\"Beide\\", \\"were\\" translates to \\"waren\\", and \\"romans à clef\\" is translated as \\"Schlüsselromane\\" in German. For \\"based on the radical adventures of Bernstein, Guy Debord, and their lovers and comrades\\", in German, it would be \\"basiert auf den radikalen Abenteuern von Bernstein, Guy Debord und ihren Geliebten und Kameraden\\". Here, \\"based on\\" is \\"basiert auf\\", \\"the radical adventures\\" translate into \\"den radikalen Abenteuern\\", \\"of\\" is translated into \\"von\\", \\"and\\" is translated into \\"und\\", \\"their\\" is translated into \\"ihren\\", \\"lovers\\" is \\"Geliebten\\", \\"and\\" again is \\"und\\", and finally \\"comrades\\" translates to \\"Kameraden\\". Step 3: Assemble the components. In German, the adjective often comes after the noun, so we need to adjust for that in our sentence structure: \\"Beide waren Schlüsselromane, basiert auf den radikalen Abenteuern von Bernstein, Guy Debord und ihren Geliebten und Kameraden\\". This translation ensures that we preserve the meaning of the original sentence in English and adapt it correctly in the German language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Black Sea Fleet  is the fleet of the Russian Navy in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Mediterranean Sea. The fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on May 13, 1783. In 1918, the fleet was inherited by the Russian SFSR then the Soviet Union in 1922, where it became part of the Soviet Navy. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Black Sea Fleet and most of its vessels were inherited by the Russian Federation. The Black Sea Fleet's official primary headquarters and facilities are located in the city of Sevastopol, which is de jure part of Ukraine but de facto part of Russia . The remainder of the fleet's facilities are based in various locations on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, including Krasnodar Krai, Rostov Oblast and Crimea. The current commander is Admiral Aleksandr Viktorovich Vitko, who has held the position since April 2013. Who inherited the Black Sea Fleet first, the Russian SFSR or the Soviet Union?","output":"The Black Sea Fleet was first inherited by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (SFSR). This occurred in 1918, just after the end of World War I and during the early days of the Russian Revolution. The Russian SFSR was one of the self-governing socialist republics that made up the Soviet Union. In 1917, the Russian RSFSR was established as a sovereign entity following the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government in the Bolshevik-led Russian October Revolution. As an independent socialist republic, it had the political and administrative authority to inherit and manage assets, such as the Black Sea Fleet, within its geographical boundaries. The Russian SFSR retained control of the Black Sea Fleet for about four years, from 1918 to 1922. In December 1922, the Russian SFSR, together with the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR, signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, marking the establishment of the Soviet Union. Following the formation of the Soviet Union, control of the Black Sea Fleet transferred from the Russian SFSR to the newly created Union. This move was part of a larger centralization effort under the new federal structure, where most defense assets, including naval fleets, were taken under the direct control of the Union government, exemplifying the command economy practiced in the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union assumed the management and command of the Black Sea Fleet, it became an integral component of the Soviet Navy, playing an essential role in the country's maritime defense strategy during most of the 20th century until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. After the Soviet Union's collapse, the Russian Federation inherited the Black Sea Fleet along with most of its vessels. This continued the fleet's history under Russian governance, beginning with its foundation by Prince Potemkin in 1783, through its tenure with the Russian SFSR, and then the Soviet Union, and finally with its current stewardship by the Russian Federation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Grumpy Old Men Context: John and Max are elderly neighbors in a cold Minnesota town. They both live alone in their homes since their wives have died, and exchange stories about how their friends are now dying when they are not busy insulting each other. They have a contemptuous rivalry that goes back over 50 years.A very attractive woman named Ariel, who is a little younger than them, moves in across the street during the days before Thanksgiving. She is so adventurous that she rides a snowmobile on the streets at night.Johns daughter Melanie has a baby girl but is separating from her husband. Maxs son Jacob is running for mayor of their town. Melanie and Jacob have an ongoing flirtation with each other.John is trying to evade the IRS, to whom he owes back taxes. One night he thinks the IRS has come for him, so he jumps out his bedroom window, and Ariel surprisingly shows up, asking to use his bathroom for no particular reason. She discloses that she has been watching how John and Max both ogle her.The next day, John tries to convince Max that his visit from Ariel was amorous in intent. Their bitter bickering at each other continues apace.Chuck is another older man who runs a local bait shop. He challenges John and Max to think about how attractive they actually are to women anymore.Johns father, known as Grandpa, goes ice-fishing out on a frozen lake, where his son and Max (and many other local men) also have their own little fishing shacks. Grandpa is a blithe spirit at the age of 94, enjoying a bounty of liquor and non-filtered cigarettes.One evening Chuck goes to visit Ariel at her home, which John and Max intently spy upon. When later asked why he was with her, Chuck says they did not have sex but something more like a spiritual awakening.John and Max thus both plan visits to Ariel and spend much time making themselves presentable.

Answer:","output":"John and Max's rivalry is over the attention and affection of Ariel, the attractive woman who moves in across the street. Ariel, a little younger than John and Max, is an adventurous woman who catches the eye of both men. As their rivalry escalates, John and Max bicker with each other, trying to outdo the other in their pursuit of Ariel. The rivalry between John and Max is further fueled by their existing contemptuous relationship, which spans over 50 years. Although their rivalry appears to center around Ariel, it is also a product of their long-standing animosity and competition with each other. Ariel's presence in the neighborhood revitalizes their rivalry, giving them a new reason to compete with one another. As the story unfolds, John and Max make attempts to impress and woo Ariel, even though they face criticism from other characters, such as Chuck, who challenges them to think about how attractive they actually are to women anymore. In their pursuit of Ariel, both John and Max feel the need to compete with each other, driving the rivalry even further. In conclusion, John and Max's rivalry revolves around their shared infatuation with Ariel, the attractive and adventurous woman who moves in across the street. The presence of Ariel reinvigorates their long-standing animosity and competition with one another, creating an intense and ongoing rivalry over her attention and affection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Staying active during the day may help alleviate any back pain you have. It will also help you burn energy, which will make it easier to fall asleep at night.  Aerobic exercise, stretching, and core-strengthening exercises are all great for people with scoliosis.  Avoid contact sports, as well as competitive swimming, which can strain your back. People with scoliosis may produce lower levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps us sleep. Nighttime light, whether it's from a lamp, the television, or any other source, disrupts melatonin production for everyone, and this is especially bad for individuals who produce less of it to start with. Keep your room nice and dark to avoid disrupting your body's melatonin production. Children with scoliosis tend to have higher levels of growth hormone. When there are high levels of growth hormone in the body, melatonin levels will usually be low. If you have just been given a brace to wear for your scoliosis, you may feel like sleeping comfortably in it will be impossible. Luckily, most people get used to their braces quickly, so it probably won't bother you at all after a week or two. If you continue to have discomfort while sleeping after the first few weeks, talk to your doctor and see if any adjustments can be made to the brace. While some people do not experience any pain from scoliosis, others suffer from severe pain. If pain is keeping you awake at night, talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for you. There are a variety of ways to treat scoliosis pain, depending on the severity of your condition.  For mild pain, you can take over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. If your pain is more severe, your doctor may suggest that you take prescription pain medication. Your doctor may also recommend spinal injections to help relieve pain, although these will only provide you with temporary relief. Physical therapy or chiropractic treatment may help you achieve long-term pain relief. If nothing else works to control your pain, your doctor may recommend surgery. The most common types of surgery performed for scoliosis are decompression surgery, which is done to remove a disc or bone that is compressing a nerve, and spinal fusion surgery, which is done to fuse two or more of the vertebrae together, thus improving the shape of the spine. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is: Maintaining an active lifestyle with aerobic, stretching, and core-strengthening exercises can help alleviate back pain and improve sleep for people with scoliosis. Avoiding contact sports and creating a dark sleep environment can also aid in better sleep. While some individuals may experience no pain, others with scoliosis suffer from varying levels of pain. Treatment options include over-the-counter medications, prescription pain relief, spinal injections, physical therapy, and chiropractic care. In some severe cases, surgery, such as decompression or spinal fusion, may be recommended. For those wearing braces, initial discomfort usually subsides within a few weeks, but adjustments can be made if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","output":"It depends on your specific needs and the intended use of the color space in your project. However, your given answer provides a brief explanation about two common color spaces: \\"For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB model.\\" Now, let me break down the factors you should consider when choosing a suitable color space for your project: 1. Device and Output Purpose: Are you working on digital media or print media? If you're focusing on digital media, like websites or video editing, sRGB is a widely accepted standard that will likely offer consistently good results across a variety of devices. However, if you intend on working with print media, such as photo printing or graphic design, Adobe RGB can provide a larger color gamut and might be more suitable for that purpose. 2. Viewing Conditions: Does your project require accurate color reproduction across different devices or environments? If so, choosing a color space that minimizes color shifts between devices and environments is essential. For instance, sRGB is a widely supported color space for digital media, making it a safer choice for maintaining color consistency across different screens. 3. Software Compatibility: Check if the software you work with supports different color spaces and allows you to switch between them effortlessly. Adobe RGB often provides better compatibility with Adobe's Suite of products, like Photoshop and Illustrator, while sRGB may work better with non-Adobe software solutions. In conclusion, consider the purpose of your project, the devices it will be consumed on, and the software you will be using to choose the most appropriate color space. Adobe RGB and sRGB are two popular examples of absolute color spaces based on the RGB model, but the choice ultimately depends on your specific project requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With Roxio DLA, users can drag and drop files onto discs and save files directly to the media without having to use additional mastering software. The UDF file system makes this possible by providing a more flexible structure for managing files on optical media, as opposed to traditional file systems like ISO 9660.

Since 1989, Dave Thomas, who died at the age of 69, was one of the most recognizable faces on TV. He appeared in more than 800 commercials for the hamburger chain named for his daughter. \\"As long as it works\\", he said in 1991, \\"I'll continue to do those commercials.\\"  Even though he was successful, Thomas remained troubled by his childhood. \\"He still won't let anyone see his feet, which are out of shape because he never had proper fitting shoes,\\" Wendy said in 1993. Born to a single mother, he was adopted as a baby by Rex and Auleva Thomas of Kalamazoo in Michigan. After Auleva died when he was 5, Thomas spent years on the road as Rex traveled around seeking construction work. \\"He fed me,\\" Thomas said, \\"and if I got out of line, he'd beat me.\\"  Moving out on his own at 15, Thomas worked, first as a waiter, in many restaurants. But he had something much better in mind. \\"I thought if I owned a restaurant,\\" he said, \\"I could eat for free.\\" A 1956 meeting with Harland Sanders led Thomas to a career as the manager of a Kentucky Chicken restaurant that made him a millionaire in 1968.  In 1969, after breaking with Sanders, Thomas started the first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, in Columbus, Ohio, which set itself apart by serving made-to-order burgers. With 6,000 restaurants worldwide, the chain now makes  6 billion a year in sales.  Although troubled by his own experience with adoption, Thomas, married since 1954 to Lorraine, 66, and with four grown kids besides Wendy, felt it could offer a future for other children. He started the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption in 1992.  In 1993, Thomas, who had left school at 15, graduated from Coconut Creek High School in Florida.

She wanted to make a toilet paper roll butterfly by using the roll's tube and paint, but was unable to finish because the","output":"paint wouldn't dry quickly enough. Undeterred, she was determined to complete her project and began exploring alternative methods to speed up the drying process. She was aware that a beautiful butterfly was waiting to emerge, hidden within the confines of the humble toilet paper roll. She started by researching the properties of the paint she was using. Upon discovering that her acrylic paint tended to dry slower than other types, she considered switching to a faster-drying paint, such as poster paint or tempura paint for her next attempt. This would undoubtedly make her butterfly come to life more swiftly. Meanwhile, she learned that the drying time of paint could also be influenced by the ambient temperature and humidity in the room. Realizing that she was working in a cooler and less ventilated space, she decided to move her workstation to a warmer and more open area of the house that would naturally promote quicker drying. After relocating her workspace, she decided to try reducing the thickness of the paint layers on the toilet paper roll. Instead of applying one thick and heavy coat, she began applying multiple thin layers, letting each layer dry before moving on to the next. This method proved to be very effective, as it significantly decreased the amount of waiting time between each coat. During her research, she also discovered that she could use a hairdryer, set on a low heat setting, to meticulously direct warm air onto the painted surface. This allowed her to take matters into her own hands, as the heat from the hairdryer gently accelerated the drying process without damaging the paint or the toilet paper roll itself. Feeling a renewed sense of hope and determination, she pressed on, adding the intricate patterns and vibrant colors that would bring her butterfly to life. With the help of her newly acquired knowledge, the once slow-drying paint became a mere obstacle rather than an insurmountable problem. Once the paint had thoroughly dried, she proceeded to transform the simple toilet paper roll into a stunning butterfly. Using scissors, she carefully cut the tube in a symmetrical, wing-like shape and attached additional sections for the antennae. Then, she added extra embellishments, such as glitter, sequins, and small beads, to give her butterfly an added touch of sparkle and charm. Finally, her hard work and determination paid off as she held the completed toilet paper roll butterfly in her hands. Its bright hues shimmered in the light, and its delicate wings sparkled, a testament to her perseverance and ingenuity. As she admired her handiwork, she felt a sense of accomplishment and a newfound appreciation for the beauty that can be found in everyday objects. Through trial and error, she had transformed a humble toilet paper roll into a vibrant and graceful work of art, proving that even the most unexpected items can hold a world of potential for creativity and inspiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  13  for the following movie plot:  At the estate of King Herman the 6â (Don Brodie) (a parody of Kaiser Wilhelm II), the deposed king of Moronica, war profiteers Ixnay (Vernon Dent), Amscray (Lynton Brent) and Umpchay (previously Onay) (Bud Jamison) have decided that they have had enough of Moe Hailstone, the fascist dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. To this end, his daughter, the princess Gilda (Mary Ainslee), threatens to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive Number 13 pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. The fictitious country of Moronica seems to be familiar with a pool game in which the 13 ball is placed at the head of the rack during set up.[1] Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Field Marshal Herring (Curly) and Minister of Propaganda (Larry) for a turkey (a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey. Larry parodies the attempts to control Greece by saying, \\"I'll wipe out grease\\"). The winner of that battle is a portrait of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges, before running out of his frame. At a loss, Hailstone starts crying. Gilda enters, and shows the Stooges a glimpse through a telescope of all three of them on a spit roasting in Hell and starts to place in Hailstone's mind the idea that his allies, the \\"Axel\\" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this, she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone's pool table with the explosive 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the rest of the game, the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics, thereby avoiding the explosive ball by swerving around it and finally jumping over it, colliding with Herring's head. Later, the Axel partners arrive for a meeting. The partners consist of Chiselini (Cy Schindell; a parody of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini), the Bey of Rum (Jack \\"Tiny\\" Lipson); an unnamed Japanese delegate (Nick Arno; a parody of Japanese emperor Hirohito (è£ä»?)); and an unnamed Russian delegate...

Place in the microwave in a glass bowl for one minute; ii. Place in the microwave in a metal bowl for one minute;","output":"Combining chocolate and coconut together to make a liquid mixture can be done in several ways, but microwaving is indeed a quick and convenient method. Considering the options you've provided, let's analyze both and see which method makes the most sense: i. Place in the microwave in a glass bowl for one minute: Using a glass bowl in the microwave is a safe and practical option. Glass is a microwave-safe material that heats evenly, allowing the ingredients to be heated consistently without the risk of any chemical components getting into your food.  To make a chocolate and coconut liquid mixture using a glass bowl, follow these steps: 1. Break or chop the chocolate into small, evenly-sized pieces. This will help the chocolate to melt evenly and avoid the formation of lumps. 2. Measure the desired amount of coconut. For a-liquid mixture, it would be best to use coconut milk or coconut cream. These two forms will blend well with the melted chocolate and create a smooth liquid mixture. 3. Combine the chocolate and coconut milk or cream in a microwave-safe glass bowl. 4. Place the bowl in the microwave and set the timer for one minute. Keep an eye on the mixture to prevent it from boiling over or burning. 5. After a minute, take the bowl out of the microwave using oven mitts or a thick cloth as it might be hot. Stir the mixture with a spoon or spatula to ensure the chocolate and coconut are fully combined. 6. If the chocolate is not completely melted, continue to microwave it in 15-30 second intervals, stirring each time until fully melted and combined. 7. Once the chocolate and coconut are thoroughly mixed, and you have a smooth and homogeneous liquid mixture, you can use it for various recipes such as beverages, sauces, or as a topping on desserts. ii. Place in the microwave in a metal bowl for one minute: It is important to note that using a metal bowl in the microwave is not recommended. Microwaving metal objects can cause a fire, damage your microwave, or result in electrical arcing, which poses a risk for you and your appliance. Metal bowls can reflect the microwaves, causing uneven heating in the food and even damaging the microwave itself. Due to these risks, it is best to avoid using a metal bowl in the microwave. In conclusion, option (i) - placing the combination of chocolate and coconut in a glass bowl and microwaving it for one minute - is the most sensible and safe method to accomplish your goal. It allows for even heating, is microwave-safe, and will provide you with a smooth and homogeneous liquid mixture perfect for various culinary applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During Tool's post-Ænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the Ænima tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff.

The problem does not only apply to language but to any representation Add punctuation.","output":"The problem does not only apply to language but to any representation. In fact, various aspects of communication and information transmission are affected by it. Firstly, let's discuss language itself. The primary purpose of language is to convey thoughts and ideas between individuals. Different languages have developed over time to suit the needs of different cultures and societies, but the way they are used is remarkably similar. All languages share common features, such as syntax, morphology, and phonology, which help create meaning and structure. However, language is not perfect. Ambiguities and misunderstandings can still occur due to various factors, such as cultural differences, context, and individual experiences. Punctuation is one such way to help clarify meaning and minimize confusion in written language. For example, commas can be used to separate a list of items, and periods mark the end of a sentence. Apostrophes indicate possession or contractions, while quotation marks denote dialogue or direct speech. Moreover, other types of representation also face similar issues. In mathematics, symbols and notations are used to represent different concepts and operations. Just like punctuation in language, the proper use of these notations, such as parentheses and brackets, is crucial to convey the correct meaning. For example, the order of operations in mathematical expressions is indicated through the use of parentheses, which helps avoid ambiguity. Visual representations, such as images, graphs, and diagrams, can also be subject to misinterpretation. The use of appropriate labels, legends, arrows, and color schemes helps to enhance clarity and minimize confusion. For example, in a bar chart, providing the units of the data being plotted along with a clearly labeled axis can aid the viewer in understanding the information displayed. In the realm of computer science, the correct use of syntax, structure, and data types is essential for ensuring the accurate representation and functionality of a program or algorithm. Just like punctuation in language, proper coding conventions and best practices help avoid misinterpretation and other errors, which can lead to unexpected results or even catastrophic failures. In music, notation plays a crucial role in representing the melody, rhythm, and harmony of a piece. Musicians rely on these notations, such as clefs, key signatures, and time signatures, to interpret and perform the music accurately. Similarly, dancers use notation systems, like Labanotation or Benesh Movement Notation, to preserve, communicate, and reproduce choreography. In conclusion, the problem of ambiguity and misinterpretation does not solely apply to language but is relevant to any representation. Whether it's spoken or written language, mathematical equations, images, computer programs, or artistic expressions, proper, and clear communication is critical to avoid confusion and misunderstandings. As such, the use of appropriate punctuation, syntax, notation, and other structural elements is vital for effective communication and information exchange in all areas of human interaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Next, I translated each word and phrase from English into Persian, considering the correct contextual meaning in the Quran and the proper sentence structure in Persian.  - \\"And\\": \\"و\\" - \\"(remember)\\": \\"(به یاد بیاور)\\" - \\"Zakariya\\": \\"زکریا\\" - \\"when he cried to his Lord\\": \\"وقتی به پروردگار خود عرضه داشت\\" - \\"O my Lord!\\": \\"ای پروردگار من!\\" - \\"leave me not without offspring\\": \\"مرا بی‌نسل نگذار\\" - \\"though\\": \\"با اینکه\\" - \\"thou art the best\\": \\"تو بهترین\\" - \\"of inheritors\\": \\"وارث‌هایی\\" Finally, I put all the translated words and phrases together in a sentence in Persian that conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. This gave us the output: \\"و (به یاد بیاور) زکریا، وقتی به پروردگار خود عرضه داشت: \\"ای پروردگار من! مرا بی‌نسل نگذار، با اینکه تو بهترین وارث‌هایی.\\"\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If The purchase authorization portion of the process is the formal approval of the purchase by responsible designated officials within the agency and usually results in the obligation of budget authority., can we conclude that \\"The purchase authorization portion is the approval.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the provided information, we can conclude that \\"The purchase authorization portion is the approval,\\" as it signifies the formal endorsement of the purchase by responsible designated officials within the agency. However, it is essential to explore this concept further to understand its scope and implications. The purchase authorization portion of the process plays a vital role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency in an organization. It is an essential component in managing budgets and resources, as well as mitigating potential risks associated with procurement processes. Here are some important aspects of the purchase authorization portion: 1. Designated officials: The approval of the purchase is provided by officials who have been designated with the authority to authorize purchases within the organization. This helps to establish a clear chain of responsibility and ensures that only authorized personnel can commit funds and resources to a procurement. 2. Obligation of budget authority: Once the purchase authorization has been granted, it usually results in the obligation of budget authority. This means that the funds necessary to cover the cost of the purchase are reserved and committed, ensuring that the organization has the financial means to fulfill its procurement responsibilities. 3. Compliance with procurement policies and procedures: The purchase authorization process also helps to ensure that all purchases are consistent with the organization's procurement policies and procedures. This promotes accountability, as well as adherence to regulatory requirements and industry best practices. 4. Documentation and record keeping: The purchase authorization process typically involves the creation and maintenance of documents and records related to the approval of purchases. This provides an audit trail and allows for oversight and review of procurement practices, ensuring that resources are effectively managed, and any potential issues are identified and addressed. 5. Risk management and due diligence: By requiring formal approval for purchases, the organization can help to mitigate potential risks associated with procurement, such as fraud, waste, and abuse. The authorization process can include necessary due diligence measures, such as supplier evaluation and contract negotiation, to ensure that purchases are in the best interest of the organization and meet all relevant criteria. In conclusion, the purchase authorization portion is indeed the approval, as it encompasses the formal endorsement of the purchase by the authorized officials within the agency. This process is crucial for effective resource management, accountability, and compliance with procurement policies and procedures. It also plays a significant role in risk management, helping to ensure that an organization's procurement activities are conducted ethically, efficiently, and in the best interest of all stakeholders."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Process: - Put water in an ice cube tray - Put the ice cube tray in the freezer - Wait 5 to 6 hours - Take the ice cube tray out of the freezer - Bend the tray slightly to get the ice cubes out and into a drink.

In March 2001, Rice asked the CIA to prepare a new series of authorities for covert action in Afghanistan. Rice's recollection was that the idea had come from Clarke and the NSC senior director for intelligence, Mary McCarthy, and had been linked to the proposal for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice described the draft document as providing for \\"consolidation plus,\\" superseding the various Clinton administration documents. In fact, the CIA drafted two documents. One was a finding that did concern aid to opponents of the Taliban regime; the other was a draft Memorandum of Notification, which included more open-ended language authorizing possible lethal action in a variety of situations. Tenet delivered both to Hadley on March 28. The CIA's notes for Tenet advised him that \\"in response to the NSC request for drafts that will help the policymakers review their options, each of the documents has been crafted to provide the Agency with the broadest possible discretion permissible under the law.\\" At the meeting, Tenet argued for deciding on a policy before deciding on the legal authorities to implement it. Hadley accepted this argument, and the draft MON was put on hold. As the policy review moved forward, the planned covert action program for Afghanistan was included in the draft presidential directive, as part of an \\"Annex A\\" on intelligence activities to \\"eliminate the al Qaeda threat.\\" The main debate during the summer of 2001 concentrated on the one new mechanism for a lethal attack on  Bin Laden-an armed version of the Predator drone. In the first months of the new administration, questions concerning the Predator became more and more a central focus of dispute. Clarke favored resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted, hoping that they still might provide the elusive \\"actionable intelligence\\" to target  Bin Laden with cruise missiles. Learning that the Air Force was thinking of equipping Predators with warheads, Clarke became even more enthusiastic about redeployment. The CTC chief, Cofer Black, argued against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes. He recalled that theTaliban had spotted a Predator in the fall of 2000 and scrambled their MiG fighters. Black wanted to wait until the armed version was ready. \\"I do not believe the possible recon value outweighs the risk of possible program termination when the stakes are raised by the Taliban parading a charred Predator in front of CNN,\\" he wrote.  Question: \\"Why did Cofer Black, argue against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes?\\" Answer: \\"He believed they would cause a war\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct.

Article: ADVERTISEMENT      Talk about hedging your bets.      While some might put their money on both the Broncos and Seahawks this weekend, a 64-year-old Republican congressional candidate is putting himself and his money into not one, but four races at the same time. Allan Levene is running for the House of Representatives in his home state of Georgia -- as well as Michigan, Minnesota and Hawaii.      While Levene's plan is unorthodox, it also seems to be legal.      The Constitution says a person elected to the House must be a resident of the state they will represent when elected, but says nothing about the primaries. So, Levene's logic goes, he doesn't have to pick one race unless and until he wins a primary.      Levene's reasoning is simple: he wants to be a member of Congress and feels he is too old to follow a traditional path by working his way up in local government. A naturalized citizen originally from England, he told FoxNews.com he feels compelled to serve.      “I have such a debt to this country, a debt of gratitude to the United States for taking me in and letting me become a citizen about 40 years ago that I have to repay it,” he said. “I just have to.”      Though his plan certainly risks turning off voters in the states where he does not live, Levene said he got the idea when he was studying the Constitution and realized it was legal.      “The Founding Fathers wrote in the Constitution -- they didn't really understand you could fly from state to state because people couldn't really travel before, they could only really focus on one state where they lived,” he said. “Times have changed so I am running in four states.”      First up on Levene’s agenda is his home state, Georgia, where he is running to replace GOP Rep. Phil Gingrey in the state's 11th District. Gingrey announced last year he will seek the Republican nomination for Senate in the race to replace GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss.      The 11th district is holding its open primary in May, three months earlier than the other states where Levene is running. Levene says he is focusing on that race for now, but if he is does not win the primary he will turn his focus to the other three.      One of the main issues Levene is running on is jobs. He said he wants to reduce the corporate tax rate to zero, with the hopes of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and creating a “tax haven” for overseas businesses. He also has a proposal he says will stop overspending in Congress by forcing incumbents out of office. His plan would allow lawmakers to be in office no more than eight years or nix their pensions.      All four of the districts Levene is running in are districts in which the incumbent is not seeking another term. Levene says he chose them for various reasons, but does not feel the fact he does not live in them should impact his electability.      “I can represent the public no matter where I live,” he said.      However, K. Mark Takai, a Hawaii state representative running as a Democrat in the same race for Hawaii's 1st district, is skeptical of that claim. Takai told FoxNews.com while he respects Levene's right to run in multiple states as long as it's legal, he finds his strategy a \\"bit odd\\" and is not sure it will resonate with Hawaiians.      “It’s the heart of democracy. The heart of representative government (is) you want someone to represent you who represents your community and its people,\\" Takai said.      However, Levene says he is already garnering strong interest in Hawaii and some interest in Michigan, because his ideas are ones that resonate across state lines.      “People are people everywhere, and they are all interested in the same thing,” he said. ||||| Allan Levene isn’t absolutely convinced of his chances in the GOP race for the congressional seat now held by U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta.      So the Kennesaw resident has hit on what he thinks is a unique strategy to increase the odds that he’ll have a job in Washington come next year.      He’s going to run in three other congressional districts as well. In three other states: Michigan (14th CD), Minnesota (6th CD) and Hawaii (1st CD). The U.S. Constitution, he notes, only requires residency at the time of next year’s November election.      Levene used to live in metro Detroit. Work as an IT man has sometimes carried him to Minnesota.      “Of course, living in Hawaii wouldn’t be bad, but I’d rather stay in Georgia,” Levene, 64, said this morning. “But I’m a practical man. I don’t have time to do this two years at a time, since I expect to be dead in 10 years.”      A London native but naturalized U.S. citizen, Levene has chosen an American football analogy: “Going wide rather than going long.”      The 11th District race in Georgia is still in its early stages. So far, Levene’s biggest splash has been his idea for a permanent solution to Middle East tensions: Create a kind of back-up Israel, just in case things get too hot at the current location. Maybe in an under-used portion of Texas.      There’s little doubt that Levene would remain an extreme long-shot in all four races – his Georgia campaign treasury is relatively miniscule, and would be even smaller when divided by four. But a quadruple race would be one for the books.      Levene said he found his loophole during his constitutional studies. The Founding Fathers, he realized, didn’t know about jet travel. “People couldn’t conceive of people running in more than one geographic area,” he said.      Levene said he checked with the Federal Election Commission. People there merely advised him to keep his contributions for each of the four contests strictly separated.      “I’ve written to every secretary of state [in the four states]. They have no problem with it,” he said.      His only concern is if he wins in two or more of his contests. Our advice: If it's a choice between Honolulu or Detroit, there is no choice. ||||| Story highlights Allan Levene wants to run for Congress in Georgia, Minnesota, Michigan and Hawaii      Constitution and state laws don't preclude the strategy      Experts mostly say it could be a waste of time, but it could set a new campaign model      It's believed Levene is the first to try the approach      Allan Levene really -- really -- wants to serve in Congress.      So much so, that he plans to run in four states: Georgia. Minnesota. Michigan. Hawaii.      It's puzzling, but the Republican freely admits his strategy increases his odds of winning a House seat.      As he sees it, all roads lead to Rome.      \\"No matter where you win a seat in Congress, you go to the same building. You do the same work,\\" he said. \\"You can work for your constituents, which all have similar needs, but the key is you go to Washington and help solve the country's problems.\\"      Legally, his strategy is possible. But it likely will be a logistical nightmare.      Running a congressional campaign as a political newcomer is tough enough. Multiply that by four and add a society that's quick to shun \\"carpetbaggers\\" -- people who move to a state to run for office -- and you get what some experts predict to be a waste of time and money.      It appears Levene may be the first to try the unusual tactic. But what if he succeeds? Is he blazing a trail for a new campaign model?      Jumping through the loophole      The Constitution lists only a few requirements for a House member: Be at least 25, a U.S. citizen for at least seven years and a resident of the state when elected.      But the Constitution says nothing about primaries or the nominating process, and that's the heart of Levene's strategy.      Leaving out a rule that would prevent multi-state campaigns was an understandable omission by the Founding Fathers, Levene said. How could they have envisioned such an approach?      \\"Back then they couldn't fly from state to state,\\" he said.      In Levene's case, all four races are open, meaning there's no incumbent. Two districts — the ones in Georgia and Minnesota — are considered safe for Republicans, while the other two are considered safe for Democrats.      The four states only require candidate residency at the time of the general election, not the primary.      They also don't have laws prohibiting candidates from running in the primary if they're attempting to get on primary ballots in other states.      The Federal Election Commission tracks the money side of federal campaigns. It told Levene his mission was legal as long he kept his fundraising separate in each state, meaning he couldn't raise money in Georgia and spend it in Minnesota.      The FEC told CNN it hasn't issued specific guidance on that kind of campaign strategy.      'All politics is local'      Levene, an avid blogger with some unorthodox ideas, has already created websites for each of his campaigns.      But his true focus is on Georgia's 11th Congressional District, whose current representative, Republican Phil Gingrey, is running for the Senate.      Of the four states, Georgia holds its primary first, on May 20. If Levene doesn't win the GOP nomination, he'll campaign in the other states. Minnesota, Michigan and Hawaii have nominating contests in August, just days apart from each other.      Jordan Powell, a Republican political consultant based in Texas, said he's never heard of someone trying to run in multiple states and argued it's not a \\"viable political strategy.\\"      \\"There's two problems: There's the practical day-to-day issues, like scheduling, fundraising, meetings, etc,\\" Powell said. \\"If you get past that, you still have a problem, to me, with voters about political opportunism.\\"      A number of people, including Powell, brought up a common saying coined by former House Speaker Thomas \\"Tip\\" O'Neill: \\"All politics is local.\\"      \\"It's very much true in Hawaii,\\" said David Chang, chairman of Hawaii's Republican Party. \\"People care what high school you went to, what nationality you are, what your last name is, how many generations your family has been in Hawaii, whether you know my auntie and uncle.\\"      \\"Being from the mainland and running for the office Hawaii, you have an uphill battle because of those dynamics,\\" he added.      Levene hasn't lived in Hawaii; he has only visited the state. But he says he still has a plan specific to the Aloha State . He wants to bring more IT jobs and companies from California and make the island known for being more than a tourist hub.      \\"It's clear that you need a noisy, loud congressional mouthpiece. I am noisy and I will put Hawaii on the map,\\" he writes on his Hawaii website.      Born in London, Levene, 64, first came to the United States when he was 21 and eventually became a naturalized citizen. He pursued a career in the IT industry and is now settled in Georgia, but he has lived in Michigan in the past, which is why he chose the Wolverine State as one of his \\"four.\\"      As for Minnesota , the 6th Congressional District has been a Republican stronghold for the past decade. Its current representative, Michele Bachmann, is retiring.      Levene is attracted to races that would essentially guarantee him a general election victory if he wins the primary.      \\"The election process is about winning first and foremost,\\" he said.      But three well-known Republicans have already been vying for the seat for months.      \\"The runway for candidates who are serious about it literally started the day Congresswoman Bachmann announced her retirement,\\" said Keith Downey, chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party.      Downey had not heard of Levene's plan to run in the state, but found it difficult to see voters gravitating toward an outsider.      \\"I would imagine, like in most places, Minnesota voters are a little more comfortable voting for their own and having some past connection to a candidate,\\" he said.      Copycats in the future?      Levene is surely hedging his bets. But what if his plan works?      A source who worked to get Democrats elected to the House last decade seemed open to the idea.      \\"I wish we had known about that. Maybe we could have gotten even more Democrats elected,\\" the source said, somewhat jokingly.      The source, who asked not to be identified, added the tactic could come in handy for candidates running in districts along state borders.      Others had a hard time imagining the strategy becoming one for the textbooks.      Powell said \\"some of the practical decisions would be easier\\" in such a scenario, but the candidate would still have a \\"messaging problem.\\"      \\"You're still looking like you just desperately want to be in Congress, regardless of the district or the issue,\\" he said. Such an image doesn't pass \\"the smell test\\" with voters, he added.      Another House campaign strategist, who asked not to be identified in order to speak more freely, had also never heard of the multi-state approach but said \\"it's something that a credible strategist would never recommend for any candidate.\\"      \\"You're opening yourself up to several attacks,\\" the source said.      'Just ideas'      Levene realizes he will run into criticism and said he's prepared to take on his opponents.      \\"I'm not carpet bagging in the sense that I want to take advantage of the district that I'm running for,\\" he said. \\"I will work very hard for whichever district that I'm elected to.\\"      For Levene, he believes he must get elected to carry out his ideas—which include carving out a back-up territory for Israel inside of Texas , and creating a pathway for thousands of Chinese nannies to come to the U.S. and teach children how to speak Mandarin.      \\"Having ideas without going to Washington means they're just ideas,\\" he said in his Americanized British accent. \\"No one will pay the slightest bit of attention.\\"      He also wants to eliminate corporate income taxes.

Levene believes this approach could maximize his chances of reaching Congress. His primary focus is Georgia's 11th Congressional District, with other states serving as fallbacks. His campaign includes proposals to reduce the corporate tax rate to zero, force incumbents out of office after eight years or forfeit their pensions, and create a back-up territory for Israel within Texas.

Nick was feeling very worried and sad since he loved Fluffy so much and didn't want anything bad to happen to him. So, William decided to help his friend by running after Fluffy, trying to bring him back to his safe and cozy home. As they ran through the house, Fluffy was like a little ball of fur, zipping under tables and chairs, and almost getting caught several times. William had to be patient and move carefully, so he wouldn't scare Fluffy away. Finally, they found Fluffy hiding behind a big plant in the corner of the room. With a gentle scoop of his hands, William picked up the adorable and playful hamster, and Nick sighed with relief. Together, they returned Fluffy to his cage, making sure that the door was locked tight so he wouldn't be able to escape again. Nick thanked William for being such a good friend and for helping him find his precious pet.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Q: Omar Ali is a young man living in Battersea in the Wandsworth area of South London, right by the railway station[4] during the mid-1980s. His father, Hussein (known to the rest of the family as Papa), once a famous left-wing British Pakistani journalist in Bombay, lives in London but hates Britain's society and its international politics. His dissatisfaction with the world and a family tragedy have led him to sink into alcoholism, so that Omar has to be his carer. By contrast, Omar's paternal uncle Nasser is a successful entrepreneur and an active member of the London Pakistani community. Papa asks Nasser to give Omar a job and, after working for a brief time as a car washer in one of his uncle's garages, he is assigned the task of managing a run-down laundrette and turning it into a profitable business.At Nasser's, Omar meets a few other members of the Pakistani community: Tania, Nasser's daughter and possibly a future bride; and Salim, who trafficks drugs and hires him to deliver them from the airport. While driving Salim and his wife home that night, the three of them get attacked by a group of right-wing extremist street punks. Their apparent leader turns out to be Johnny, Omar's childhood friend. Omar tries to reestablish their past friendship, offering Johnny a job and the opportunity to adopt a better life by working to fix up the laundrette with him. Johnny decides to help with the laundrette and they resume a romantic relationship that (it is implied) had been interrupted after school. Running out of money, Omar and Johnny sell one of Salim's drug deliveries to make cash for the laundrette's substantial renovation.On the opening day of the laundrette, Omar confronts Johnny on his fascist past. Johnny, feeling guilty, tells him that though he cannot make it up to him, he is with him now. Nasser visits the laundrette with his mistress, Rachel. As they dance together in the laundrette, Omar and Johnny make love in the back room, narrowly escaping discovery. At the inauguration, Tania confronts Rachel about having an affair with her father. Rachel accuses Nasser of having invited Tania on purpose to have her insulted, and storms off despite his protests. Later that night, a drunk Omar proposes to Tania, who accepts on the condition that he raise money to get away. Soon after, Salim reveals to Omar that he is on to them, and demands his money back. Omar's father stops by late in the night and appeals to Johnny to persuade Omar to go to college because he is unhappy with his son running a laundrette.Offering Salim a chance to invest in his businesses as a much needed 'clean outlet' for his money, Omar decides to take over two laundrettes owned by a friend of Nasser. Salim drives Johnny and Omar to view one of the properties, and he expresses his dislike of the British non-working punks in Johnny's gang. He attempts to run them over and injures one of them. Meanwhile, Rachel falls ill with a skin rash apparently caused by a ritual curse from Nasser's wife, and decides it is best for all that she and Nasser part ways. The next day Tania drops by the laundrette and tells Johnny she is leaving, asking him to come along. He refuses, implicitly revealing the truth about himself and Omar and she departs wordlessly. After Salim arrives and enters the laundrette, the punks, who had been lying in wait, trash his car. When he runs out on noticing them, he is ambushed and viciously attacked. Johnny decides to interrupt and defend him, despite their mutual dislike, and the punks turn their attention to him instead. As he refuses to fight back, they beat him savagely until Omar returns and intervenes, protecting Johnny as the punks trash the laundrette and flee the scene.Nasser visits Papa, and the two discuss their respective failures, agreeing between them that only Omar's future matters now. Nasser sees Tania at the train platform while she is running away, and he shouts to her but she disappears. Meanwhile, at the laundrette, Omar nurses Johnny, and the two bond.

Answer the following question: If animals get food by eating other living things, then what get food by eating other living things?  Answer choices: - fungi  - a fish  - humans  - viruses  - Animals  - algae  - bacteria  - plankton Answer:","output":"All the answer choices listed, except viruses and algae, can obtain food by consuming other living things. Here's a brief explanation for each: 1. Fungi: Many fungi are decomposers and obtain their nutrients by breaking down dead organic matter. However, some fungi can also be parasites, preying on living organisms. 2. A fish: Fish are animals, and many of them are carnivorous or omnivorous, meaning they consume other living organisms like smaller fish, insects, or plankton as a food source. 3. Humans: As part of the animal kingdom, humans are omnivores, and our diet includes various living organisms like plants and animals. 4. Viruses: Viruses don't \\"eat\\" living things in the traditional sense. They infect and take control of a host cell's machinery to reproduce themselves. Therefore, they cannot be considered as organisms that get food by consuming other living things. 5. Animals: Most animals (not including herbivores) get their food by consuming other living plants or animals. 6. Algae: Algae are photosynthetic organisms that produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis. Though they don't consume other living organisms, they may absorb nutrients from the environment. 7. Bacteria: Some bacteria are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain their food by consuming other living organisms or organic materials. Others are autotrophic, producing their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. 8. Plankton: Zooplankton, a subset of plankton, are small, often microscopic animals that consume other plankton or detritus. Phytoplankton, on the other hand, are photosynthetic microorganisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis. In summary, fungi, fish, humans, animals, bacteria, and some types of plankton (zooplankton) get food by consuming other living things."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When the weather is hot, you go to a lake or an ocean. When you are near a lake or an ocean, you feel cool. Why? The sun makes the earth hot, but it can not make the water hot. Though the air over the earth becomes hot, the air over the water stays cool. The hot air over the earth goes up, then the cool air over the water moves in and takes the place of the hot air. When you are near a lake or an ocean, you feel the cool air when _ moves in. You feel the wind and the wind makes you cool. Of course, scientists cannot answer all of our questions. If we ask \\"Why is the ocean full of salt?\\" scientists will say that the salt comes from rocks. When a rock gets very hot or very cool, it cracks   , and rain falls into the cracks. The rain then carries the salt into the earth and the rivers. The rivers carry the salt into the ocean. But then we ask \\"What happens to the salt in the ocean?

Movie plot title: The Nutty Professor Movie plot: At Wellman College, thousands of hamsters overrun the campus, due to the massively obese, yet loving and kind-hearted, professor Sherman Klump, who accidentally releases them. Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off). Reggie is present again and Buddy takes revenge and heckles him mercilessly. Sherman's \\"Buddy\\" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, causing him to be overly assertive and confident. Klump's assistant Jason witnesses Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card on the bar. Jason follows Buddy and witnesses the transformation back into Klump. The next morning, Dean Richmond has set up a meeting with wealthy Harlan Hartley at The Ritz to have Sherman explain the serum in the hopes of gaining Hartley's 10 million donation to the science department.

Given the question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Who got a law degree? - Meade - his wife - not enough information - the brother The answer is:","output":"Meade"},{"instruction":"Q:Siam Park -- Lagoa, Portugal Slide and Splash is Portugal's largest water park and at 16,000 acres, it is widely considered to be one of the best in Europe.

Answer the following question: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Ryan Gorman. Police have arrested two teenagers in the savage beating of 54-year-old. white man left in a coma after he got out of his car to check on a young black boy he accidentally hit. The two suspects, aged 16 and 17, were arrested in connection with the attack last week of beloved grandfather Steve Utash,. who was brutally beaten by an angry. mob in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood after David Harris, 10, ran in. front of his truck on a busy street. Detroit police say about a dozen vigilantes beat Utash Wednesday, even stealing his wallet before leaving him injuries severe enough to cause bleeding on the brain - he is still in a medically induced coma. News of the arrests came as donations passed the 100,000 mark on a webpage set up to raise money to pay for Utash's mounting hosptial bills. Loving father: Steve Utash pictured with daughter Mandi Marie Utash. He was brutally beaten by a gang of men in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood. Hoping and praying: A family member holds Steve Utash's hand as he is in a medically-induced coma at a local hospital. The two arrested are expected to be arraigned Monday or Tuesday, a police spokesperson told MailOnline. Expected charges were not immediately available. They were brought into custody Saturday morning by police without resistance from their homes with tips from the community, authorities told WXYZ. Community group Detroit 300 was seen in a WJBK report canvassing the neighborhood door to door with flyers and pleas for help tracking down the additional assailants. Detroit 300 joined police in saying there is no reason to suspect the attack was racially motivated. 'This is just an issue that happened, we're not going to put a racial component on it,' said one member of the. group. 'These sort of things could have happened whether it would have. been white on white, black on black, the fact of the matter is that it. was wrong and it shouldn't have happened. 'This unprovoked attack on Steve is just inexcusable.' News of the arrests was welcomed by a family member who spoke to WDIV. 'Happy, glad but now since the two dominos are going to fall, they're going to find out,' said brother-in-law Max Mohr. 'We want them all.' 'We want them all': Brother-in-law Mar Mohr says the family is happy arrests have been made, but this is only the beginning. Group of friends: Four individuals are shown. standing by the side of the road at left and Harris can be seen darting. head on into traffic at right. It also came as the family says a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for the uninsured man's medical bills has raked in more than 111,000 - the goal was 50,000. The family is grateful for the outpouring of generosity that has come from around the world. 'They're so appreciative that they don't really know how to take what the world is saying about this and their dad being the way he is,' Mohr added after saying that Utash's condition has not changed in days - there is still bleeding on his brain. The donations and arrests are good news for a family that has found it hard to come by in recent days, and come as community leaders are rallying around the family with calls to end the random violence that plagues the blighted city. 'We’re a predominantly black church and Mr. Utash is white, but love is universal,' Reverend Maurice Rudd said during his Sunday sermon, according to the Detroit Free-Press. 'There are no boundaries to love. Love crosses all racial barriers, all levels of class. 'There is something in the spirit in southeast Michigan,' he continued. 'The spirit of violence... has infected our people.' 'Why are we so angry? What's wrong with us?' Reverend Larry Simmons shouted to his church during a Sunday sermon, according to the paper. Simmons called on his flock to perform 'random acts of kindness' every day, and said 'we aren't going to be silent anymore... in the midst of all this anger.' Rev. David Alexander Bullock echoed his thoughts across town during his Sunday sermon. 'It’s the responsibility of the faith community to engage those who are blind, in this case, a mob of young men who don’t see clearly, who flew into a rage... we can't stand idly by, we have to engage them.' Loving husband: Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr Utash, was beaten into a life-threatening coma after stopping to help a 10-year-old boy he hit with his pick-up truck in Detroit. His family say he has no insurance. He's going to survive: David Harris, 10, suffered a broken leg after running into traffic in the busy street. The calls came after another driver was beaten, this time to death, at a Detroit gas station. Utash himself was left for dead by the angry mob. 'If it went on any longer, my dad wouldn’t be in the hospital right now, he would be in the morgue,' son Joseph Utash told CBS Detroit. Security. footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of. shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed. down by Utash's vehicle. Utash, from suburban Roseville,. immediately stopped to check on the boy, but several black males from. their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene. Police quickly ruled the incident an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained. But what happened next is considered by Utash's family to be an act of retaliation. Police. tell MailOnline that about a dozen young males attacked the married. father of three, beating him into a coma that he still hasn't woken from. Family man: Utash is a married father of two children - the relatives pictured are not identified. Moment of impact: Mr Utash hits David Harris just after the boy ran into the street. On the ground: The young boy is crumpled in heap on the ground just after being hit. Released from the hospital: Harris suffered only a broken leg, he has already been sent home. 'It’s not like he hit the kid on purpose and they were trying to get revenge,' daughter Felicia Utash told WXYZ. 'He literally just tried to stop and help the kid and people came out of nowhere and tried to kill him.' His son Joseph Utash hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime. 'I. think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s. been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same. company... they know he has money and they robbed him. 'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.' Police immediately dismissed the notion. 'We have no evidence to suggest it's a hate crime,' Moreno told MailOnline. The. boy's father was arrested after a background check revealed he has an. active warrant, according to the Detroit Free-Press, but police declined to say if he would be charged in. connection with the beating. Mob rule: The angry mob that would soon mercilessly beat Utash begins gathering where the boy was struck. Devastated: Daughter Felicia Utash (right) insisted her father (left) was only trying to do the right thing. Witnesses said Utash immediately pulled over to check on Harris after hitting him. ‘David was laying right in front of the. driveway and he had blood coming out of his mouth,’ James Duston Jr.,. the boy’s godfather told WXYZ.  He couldn’t move his body.’ The crowd ran towards the boy's screams and mercilessly beat Utash. ‘This little boy was screaming,’ a woman told the Free Press. ‘There was a lot of people that came out. It was crazy.’ All hell broke loose. ‘I think it lasted about one minute and. then they let him go,’ a bystander told WXYZ. ‘And then they jumped back. on him again and they did it about three times and finally someone was. trying to help the guy that got beat up.’ ‘He had the biggest gash on his head I. ever seen – he was bleeding from the mouth and he was unconscious when I. first got there,’ Debra Hughes told WWJ. Harris suffered a broken leg, he has since been released from a local hospital, Moreno said. A message left with the family seeking further comment has not yet been returned. Brutal: The unidentified driver was savagely beaten after stopping to check on the young boy he accidentally hit with while driving this pickup truck. ‘It was sad because I knew the guy was getting out of his car to try and see what damage he did,’ the witness added. ‘He got his,’ another witness to the beating told the Free Press. ‘He got beat up real bad.’Both the driver and the boy were taken to a local hospital. The boy’s family condemned the beating. ‘We don’t condone that at all,’ said Duston. ‘I told his mom and she just was like, no, we wouldn’t want that to happen.’ Doctors are still trying to determine if Utash will need surgery to save his life. Where it happened: The boy ran out into the street at this spot on Detroit's east side, police said. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This news article is about a 54-year-old man named Steve Utash, who was driving his truck when a 10-year-old boy named David Harris accidentally ran in front of his vehicle. Steve stopped the truck to check on David, but an angry mob of teenagers started beating Steve brutally, stealing his wallet, and leaving him severely injured with bleeding in his brain. Steve ended up in a medically induced coma. Two teenagers, aged 16 and 17, were arrested in connection with the attack. The news of the arrests made the family happy, but they want all who participated in the attack to be found and arrested. A GoFundMe page was created to help pay for Steve's medical bills since he did not have insurance, and the donations have exceeded the goal. Community leaders and church members are rallying around the family and calling for an end to the random violence in the city. Overall, this article tells the story of a tragic event and the community support for the victim and his family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Women born after 6 April 1951 should all have been warned that they would not get a state pension at 60, as their retirement age is gradually raised. But thousands of women have complained that they were not given proper notice of the change. However, the government insisted all those women were contacted directly. \\"They deserve compensation. They were wronged,\\" said Baroness Bakewell, who was previously a government \\"tsar\\" for older people. \\"They expected that their pension would start at a certain age - 60 - and then the law was changed quite suddenly.\\" Under the 1995 Pensions Act, the government decided that the pension ages of both men and women would be equalised by 2020. Previously, women retired at 60, while men retired at 65. In 2011, state pension ages were raised at an even faster rate. Some of those born between April 1951 and 1960 will not qualify for a pension until the age of 66. Campaigners belonging to Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI)  say some women had very little notice that they would not get a pension at 60. Norah Hickey, a 61 year-old former teacher from Solihull in the West Midlands, said she only had two years' warning. \\"When I was informed at the age of 58 that I wouldn't be getting it, it really was a big shock,\\" she told the BBC. Instead of getting her pension at 60, she will now get it at 65, meaning she will have lost at least Â£30,000 in pension payments. She said she had lived at the same address for 26 years, so there was no excuse for not writing to tell her. The government's state pension calculator is available here. However the government said that all those affected were written to, using address details recorded by HM Revenue and Customs. It said it would not be \\"revisiting\\" the arrangements. \\"I can't see any way in which the government would undo a law that was properly made in 2011, and which is potentially going to cost billions of pounds,\\" pensions minister Baroness Altmann told the BBC. \\"I really do feel for them. But at the end of the day most of these women will still get their state pension before a man born at the same time,\\" she said. More than 35,000 people have now signed a petition asking for the government to make transitional arrangements, to ease financial difficulties. Those whose pension ages are raised after 2017 are likely to be given at least ten years' notice of the changes.

Given the question: Given the background: Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off.  and the situation: Bob just came from a hot air balloon ride. On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly.  Answer the following question: Would balloon B have higher or lower inside pressure than balloon A? The answer is:","output":"Balloon B would have a higher inside pressure than balloon A. Step 1: Understand the background information.  The background information states that the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside when it's flat, which is the case for balloon A. And when the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases, and the pressure goes up. This situation is applicable for balloon B, which is inflated. Step 2: Compare the pressure inside both balloons.  Since balloon A is flat, its inside pressure is equal to the outside pressure. However, balloon B's inside pressure has increased because the air inside it has been heated, causing the balloon to inflate.  Step 3: Determine the higher pressure.  As the balloon B is inflated and the air molecules inside are moving at a higher speed, the pressure inside balloon B is higher than the pressure inside the flat balloon A.

One night, Trevor delivers instead and gets busted by narcs. 5 years later, Trevor is released from jail and learns his girlfriend Laura is now with Billy. Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster.  Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened.  However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back.  He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit. He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less sediment available happens, how will it affect less kerogen occurs.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If less sediment is available in the environment, it will indeed have a direct effect on the formation of kerogen. As you mentioned, the process of kerogen formation begins when dead organic material accumulates on the ocean floor, riverbeds, or swamps, mixing with mud and sand. Over time, sediment layers pile on top of this organic material, generating heat and pressure, which cause the organic layer to undergo chemical transformation, resulting in the formation of kerogen. In the perturbation hypothesis, where there is less sediment available, the organic material would not be subjected to the same levels of heat and pressure as required for the formation of kerogen. This is because the sediment layers on top of the organic material play a crucial role in providing the necessary heat and pressure involved in the process. Less sediment means that there will be less overburden pressure, leading to a decrease in the overall heat and pressure experienced by the organic material. As a result, it is highly likely that less kerogen will be formed in such a scenario. This can indirectly impact the formation of petroleum or natural gas, as they typically form from the cracking of kerogen molecules under certain temperature and pressure conditions. With less kerogen available, the subsequent formation of petroleum or natural gas could also be negatively affected. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of less sediment available would directly hinder the formation of kerogen, as the required heat and pressure are reduced. This in turn would have an indirect effect on the generation of petroleum and natural gas from these source materials."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.  After reading the above, is \\"One million\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How many people were jailed because of the Salt March?\\"? Options: (A). no (B). yes","output":"(A). no The correct answer is \\"no,\\" because one million people were not jailed because of the Salt March.

Article: Computerworld - The first presidential debate lit up social networks Wednesday night, even staggering Twitter throughout the one-and-a-half-hour debate.      President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney faced off in their first debate before the presidential election next month. And it wasn't just a big night for the two candidates. It also was a big night for the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Google+ .      While social networks played a role in the 2008 presidential election, they've taken an even bigger part this year.      That's not surprising since, for instance, Facebook had 100 million monthly users in 2008 and today it has 955 million. Using social networks is an effective way to send a single message out to potentially millions of eyeballs.      Twitter played a starring role during the debate, which was the most tweeted about event in U.S. political history, generating 10.3 million Tweets in 90 minutes, according to Twitter.      People are increasingly turning to social networks to share their opinions on the candidates and the issues. However, the individual campaigns also are using Facebook and Twitter, which set up a dedicated page for the debate.      So when it came time for the first debate to air, users split their focus between watching the verbal sparring and tweeting their reactions with criticism, cheers and jokes.      Twitter's Government and Politics team noted early on that tweets about the debate were coming in fast and furiously. \\"We're only minutes into the event and have already passed 2 million Tweets about this debate over the past 24 hours. #debates,\\" tweeted @gov.      The heavy load on Twitter began well before the debate kicked off. Twitter noted, \\"In the last 24 hours there have now been twice as many Tweets about tonight's debate than there were about all of the #debates in 2008.\\"      The heavy load took its toll on the microblogging site.      Twitter's first noticeable stumble came just after 9:30 when the site didn't come up for some users for about seven minutes. It came back but was in trouble again just before 10 p.m. ET but the site struggled with slow load times and partially loaded pages off and on through at least 11 p.m.      Despite Twitter's efforts to keep up with the onslaught of usage, the site noted that one of the most-tweeted moments of the debate came when Romney said he loves Big Bird but would cut funding to PBS.      Shortly after, Twitter reported there were 17,000 tweets per minute for \\"Big Bird\\" and 10,000 tweets per minute for \\"PBS.\\"      Facebook wasn't being left out of it, either. Images of Sesame Street's Big Bird holding a sign that reads, \\"Will work for food\\" quickly began showing up on the social network.      Big Bird also showed up in the running list of debate-related topics, such as #debates, Jim Lehrer and #PresidentialDebate2012, that began appearing in Twitter's top 10 trending topics hours before the debate even began.      Both the Obama and the Romney campaigns were trying to get as much play on the social networks as possible. Both political camps set up Web sites that promoted tweets and potential social network postings, offering suggestions for what users could post and retweet.

When the first of this season’s debates started on Wednesday in Denver, the scoring began at 9:01 p.m., as soon as Jim Lehrer, the moderator, said “Good evening.”      Mr. Lehrer’s open-ended questions, Mitt Romney’s plan to end the federal subsidy for PBS and Mr. Romney’s high energy level — against President Obama’s comparatively low energy level — all received spikes of attention from viewers who were chatting online along with the debate. The instant feedback helped harden conventional wisdom that Mr. Obama had turned in a weak performance, even before he had finished speaking.      On MSNBC, liberal hosts like Ed Schultz were taken aback by Mr. Obama. Mr. Schultz threw up his arms at one point after the debate and asked, “Where was the president tonight?”      His colleague, Chris Matthews, loudly suggested that Mr. Obama watch MSNBC’s programs for debating advice. “He will learn something every night on this show and all these shows,” he said.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      After Mr. Obama was pronounced “rusty” by CNN hosts, the analyst David Gergen said, “I didn’t think he was rusty so much as I don’t think anybody’s ever spoken to him like that over the last four years. I think he found that not only surprising, but offensive in some ways.”      Photo      The recent surge in so-called second-screen behavior was vividly on display during the debate, both on social networking sites like Twitter that barely existed four years ago and on all manner of even newer apps promoted by media companies. At least half a dozen outlets, as varied as CNBC and The Huffington Post, had debate drinking games ready to go beforehand. ||||| Image credit: Mark Lennihan/AP Photo      While President Obama and Mitt Romney were trying to tout their economic plans, the social media sphere was massively distracted by a big yellow bird - Big Bird that is.      After Romney said, \\"I love Big Bird,\\" but that he plans to cut funding for PBS anyhow, social media exploded with tweets about the \\"Sesame Street\\" character.      According to Twitter data, the words \\"Big Bird\\" were tweeted 17,000 times per minute and \\"PBS,\\" the channel that airs \\"Sesame Street,\\" peaked at 10,000 tweets per minute.\\"Big Bird\\" was also the fourth highest-rising search term on Google.      Romney's comment sparked the hashtag #SaveBigBird, which was trending worldwide, and spawned at least three pro-Big Bird Twitter handles, @BigBird, @BigBirdRomney and @FiredBigBird.      The @BigBird handle, which sent out comments such as, \\"I guess I'm the 47%…\\" and, \\"Even Ernie is mad! :(\\", had nearly 14,000 followers one hour after the debate ended.      The @FiredBigBird went virtually viral, garnering 2,000 followers in two minutes. One hour after the debate, 16,000 people were following the account.      The @BigBirdRomney account, which had about 7,000 followers an hour after the debate, fired off nearly 50 tweets during the debate.      \\"Under Mitt #Romney, Sesame Street will become an extension of Wall Street,\\" read one tweet.      \\"Under Mitt #Romney, Cookie Monster won't receive the care he needs to overcome his addiction,\\" read another.      \\"Sesame Street\\" declined to comment on Big Bird's newfound political fame, saying that the show is careful to remain apolitical and noting that Big Bird is only six years old and, thus, does not understand politics.      The deluge of tweets were soon followed by an onslaught of .gifs, Tumblr images and blog posts. But despite the online explosion, Romney's intentions to cut funding to PBS are not new. He often mentions it as an example of how he will cut spending to shore up deficits and bring down the debt.      \\"I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS,\\" Romney said at Wednesday's debate. \\"I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually, [I] like you [moderator Jim Lehrer], too. But I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.\\"      Lehrer, who rarely spoke throughout the debate, was also mocked by the Twitterverse, inspiring the Twitter account @SilentJimLeher and propelling the moderator's name into the top trends nationwide.      And while Big Bird and PBS were the big winners - or losers depending on how you look at it - on Twitter, the first presidential debate of was the most tweeted political event in U.S. history.      Shortly after President Obama and Romney left the stage, Twitter spokeswoman Rachael Horwitz tweeted, \\"Tonight's debate was the most tweeted about event in US political history, topping the numbers from the RNC and DNC. #debates.\\"      The debate generated more than 10.3 million tweets to move ahead of the 9.5 million tweets measured across the several days of the Democratic Convention last month and the 4 million tweets of the Republican Convention, according to Twitter Government ( @gov), who track political tweets. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. |||||Summary:","output":"The first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012 exploded on social media platforms, marking a significant shift in political discussions and communication. This debate became the most tweeted about event in U.S. political history at the time, generating 10.3 million tweets in a duration of 90 minutes. Social networks, notably Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, played a prominent role in this event. These platforms served as primary channels for immediate reactions, commentary, and discussion, providing a wide audience with a real-time platform to voice their opinions on the candidates and the issues being discussed. This marked a stark difference in usage from previous years, which was largely due to the rapid growth of platforms, such as Facebook, that had increased its monthly users from 100 million in 2008 to 955 million in 2012. One of the most tweet-driven moments of the debate came when Romney bluntly stated his love for Big Bird, a popular Sesame Street character, but also his intention to cut funding to PBS, the network that airs the program. Following this statement, there were 17,000 tweets per minute for \\"Big Bird\\" and 10,000 tweets per minute for \\"PBS.\\" Images related to Big Bird also started to appear on Facebook, reinforcing the debate's relevance and broad reach over social media.  This activity on social media influenced the strategy of both political campaigns. Both the Obama and Romney camps actively utilized these platforms to get as much traction and attention as possible. They set up websites that promoted tweets and potential social network postings, suggesting what users could post and retweet. However, the massive surge of activity took a toll on the platforms. Twitter, in particular, struggled to handle the influx of usage. Just after 9:30 p.m., the site was inaccessible for some users for about seven minutes and continued to experience slow load times and partially loaded pages throughout the night.  Despite these challenges, this debate marked a significant milestone in the relationship between politics and social media. It demonstrated the potential of these platforms as effective channels for political discourse and instant public response. Furthermore, it shed light on the potential influence and repercussions of political comments and decisions reflected through instant social media reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Sept. 4, 2012 -- Blood sugar levels at the high end of what is considered normal may put the brain at risk, according to a new Australian study.      Researchers in Canberra report a link between the shrinkage of two brain regions, the hippocampus and the amygdala, and normal blood sugar levels.      The hippocampus and amygdala are involved in memory, among other things, and researcher Nicolas Cherbuin, PhD, says shrinkage in these areas could worsen memory.      \\"It has been generally assumed that blood glucose in the normal range is not a risk factor for brain health in non-diabetics,\\" Cherbuin says. \\"If the present results are replicated in other studies the definition of normal fasting blood glucose levels and of diabetes may need to be re-evaluated.\\"      Results Are 'Robust'      For the study, Cherbuin, a neuroscientist at Australian National University in Canberra, and his colleagues studied 249 people in their early 60s. Each of them had blood sugar levels in the normal range. At the beginning of the study, and again four years later, the researchers scanned their brains.      Comparing the before and after images, they found significant brain shrinkage among those whose blood sugar levels were high but still below the World Health Organization's threshold for pre-diabetes. The researchers report that those high levels may account for a 6% to 10% decrease in the volume of the hippocampus and amygdala.      Cherbuin and his team then excluded people who were overweight or obese, and substituted the American Diabetes Association's stricter normal range for that endorsed by the WHO. The results were virtually the same.      Cherbuin says they did not take their conclusion \\"lightly,\\" but the association between these higher blood sugar levels and brain shrinkage was \\"robust.\\"      Next, he plans to study the impact that such brain changes may have.      More Research Required      Cherbuin's results suggest a need to reassess what's considered a healthy blood sugar level, but more research must be done before any changes to recommendations are made, says neurologist Marc Gordon, MD.      \\"The research is too preliminary, and the association shown here does not establish a cause or mechanism,\\" says Gordon, chief of neurology at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y., who describes the study as thoughtful and carefully considered. \\"To speak as a clinician and tell patients that they better cut out all candy because it will shrink their brain is a leap of faith.\\" ||||| Reported by Julielynn Wong, M.D., ABC News Medical Unit      High blood sugar levels may take a toll on the brain, a new study found.      The Australian study of nearly 250 non-diabetic men and women found those with high blood sugar levels tended to have shrinking in brain areas linked to memory and emotional processing. The results held up even after controlling for lifestyle factors such as smoking and weight.      \\"If replicated, this finding may contribute to a reevaluation of the concept of normal blood glucose levels and the definition of diabetes,\\" wrote study author Dr. Nicolas Cherbuin, director of the Neuroimaging and Brain Lab at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.      Previous research has linked diabetes, a disorder in which blood sugar levels are abnormally high, to age-related cognitive decline. But the new study, published Monday in the journal Neurology, suggested controlling blood sugar levels could boost cognitive health in non-diabetics.      How exactly? The jury's still out.      Some studies suggest blood sugar control can help regulate the body's inflammatory response, which has been linked to brain shrinkage. Another theory is that high sugar levels make the blood stickier, raising the risk of clots that starve the brain.      Either way, experts said, the study supports healthy eating to keep blood sugar levels in check.      \\"This in line with many other studies that have been published and adds to all of the data on diabetes affecting brain health,\\" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, director of the Memory Disorders Program and a professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center, who was not involved with this study.      For non-diabetic patients with high blood sugar levels, Turner recommended adopting the American Diabetes Association diet, which is high in non-starchy vegetables and low in carbohydrates and protein. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"An Australian study found that having high blood sugar levels might be bad for the brain, even if a person does not have diabetes. The study looked at around 250 people and discovered that those with high blood sugar had some shrinking in areas of the brain related to memory and emotions. This could lead to reconsidering what is thought of as a normal level of blood sugar.

Oscar is still hosting a regular poker game and is still an untidy slob, now living in Sarasota, Florida, but still a sportswriter. One day, he is called by his son Brucey with an invitation to California for his wedding the following Sunday. A second shock for Oscarâthe woman his son is marrying is Felix's daughter, Hannah. On the flight from New York to Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Felix has not changed his waysâhe is still a fussy, allergy-suffering neat freak nuisance. Oscar and Felix are reunited at the airport and very happy to be together again after 17 years of separationâat least for a couple of minutes. They intend to share a rental car to San Malina for the wedding. But the trip begins with Oscar forgetting Felix's suitcase at the Budget car rental, including wedding gifts and wardrobe inside. Oscar also loses the directions to San Malina when his cigar ashes burn them. He and Felix become hopelessly lost, unable to even remember the name of the town where they are headed, so many California city names sounding alike. They end up in a rural area, where the car rolls off a cliff and catches fire. If that were not enough, they get arrested several times by the local police, first for catching a ride in a truck carrying illegal Mexican immigrants. At a bar in town, they meet two extroverted women, Thelma and Holly, and buy them drinks. Accepting an offer of a ride from a stranger even older than themselves, Felix and Oscar end up inside a 150,000 vintage Rolls Royce Silver Wraith with a dead body and get arrested a second time. Irritated, exhausted and convinced that they'll never get to the wedding, they get arrested yet again for consorting with armed Rednecks who believe Oscar and Felix were flirting with their wild women, Thelma and Holly.

If you have figured out that one of your family members is struggling with depression, it can be seem like you had something to do with it. But it’s not your fault. Depression makes it hard to for people to connect emotionally with their loved ones. To be available to this person and help them, it is important to understand that it’s not personal. When you are talking to a depressed family member, you have to keep in mind that they are dealing with an actual physical problem. It can be tempting to blame their mental disorder on decisions they have made, but recognizing that it’s not their fault can help you be less critical and more supportive. Keep in mind that your love and support can help them recover from depression. Your support of their recovery process is one of the most valuable things you can offer someone struggling with depression. Offering to let someone with depression talk about what they are feeling without judging them is an important part of recovery. It will help them feel less alone. You can also offer to help them find a support group, where they can talk to people who have been through what they are going through to help them feel less alone. To help your depressed family member, you need to know what they are experiencing. With depression, there are a lot of things that can be going on, so you have to ask direct questions to get to the heart of it. You can prompt your loved one to explore why they are feeling depressed to help them get to the other side of it. Ask questions like:  “When did you first start to feel bad?” ”Do you know what triggered these feelings?” ”What makes it worse?” ”What makes it better?” Demanding that your loved one change the way they feel is a pointless exercise, mostly because they don’t know how to change how they feel. You will feel frustrated when they don’t change, and they will feel angry toward you, perhaps even feeling more depressed than ever. This can also trigger shame in them, which makes things even worse. If you try to rescue your family member, they will not learn for themselves how to manage feelings of sadness on their own. It is unlikely that you will be able to make the depression go away, and the fact that you are sticking your finger into their lives can trigger depressed relatives to feel frustrated with you.  This will also lead you to have negative interactions with your loved one, such as when fixing it doesn’t work and you get angry with them. Accept them for who they are and where they are emotionally. Develop realistic expectations for your depressed loved one and maintain an attitude full of hope for them. Your loved one can get help for depression, and they can change. There is hope, and if you keep this in the forefront of your mind, you can help them have hope as well.","output":"This article is about how to support a family member who is dealing with depression by understanding it's not their fault, asking them about their feelings, avoiding blame and not trying to fix them, but instead offering love, patience and hope for their recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Eastleigh is in Hampshire, England, and the main town in the Borough of Eastleigh. The town lies between Southampton and Winchester, and is part of the South Hampshire conurbation. The first substantial growth was as a railway town. Now it is home to many businesses, including a manufacturing plant owned by Prysmian Cables & Systems (formerly the cables division of Pirelli). The town lies on the River Itchen, one of England's premier chalk streams for fly fishing, a designated site of Special Scientific Interest.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - Collage (from the , \\"to glue\\") is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the visual arts, where the artwork is made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Portsea Island is a small, flat and low-lying island just off the south coast of England. The island is totally within, and contains a large proportion of, the city of Portsmouth. The third largest by population of any island in the British Isles after the mainlands of Great Britain and Ireland, it has the highest population density.  - Population density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term.  - Havant is a town in the south east corner of Hampshire, England approximately midway between Portsmouth and Chichester. Its borough (population: 125,000) comprises the town and its suburbs including the resort of Hayling Island as well as Rowland's Castle (an exurb), the smaller town of Waterlooville and Langstone Harbour.
