There are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer. Different types of treatments are available for patients with testicular cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment. Good Prognosis For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true: - The tumor is found only in the testicle or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and - The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and - The levels of all the tumor markers are slightly above normal. For seminoma, all of the following must be true: - The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and - The level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is normal. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be at any level. Intermediate Prognosis For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true: - The tumor is found in one testicle only or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and - The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and - The level of any one of the tumor markers is more than slightly above normal. For seminoma, all of the following must be true: - The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; and - The level of AFP is normal. -hCG and LDH may be at any level. Poor Prognosis For nonseminoma, at least one of the following must be true: - The tumor is in the center of the chest between the lungs; or - The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or - The level of any one of the tumor markers is high. There is no poor prognosis grouping for seminoma testicular tumors. Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery to remove the testicle (inguinal orchiectomy) and some of the lymph nodes may be done at diagnosis and staging. (See the General Information and Stages sections of this summary.) Tumors that have spread to other places in the body may be partly or entirely removed by surgery. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat testicular cancer. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. See Drugs Approved for Testicular Cancer for more information. Surveillance Surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the cancer has recurred (come back). In surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests on a regular schedule. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells. See Drugs Approved for Testicular Cancer for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Men who have had testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle. A patient is advised to regularly check the other testicle and report any unusual symptoms to a doctor right away. Long-term clinical exams are very important. The patient will probably have check-ups frequently during the first year after surgery and less often after that. Treatment Options by Stage Stage 0 (Testicular Intraepithelial Neoplasia) Treatment of stage 0 may include the following: - Radiation therapy. - Surveillance. - Surgery to remove the testicle.

Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Stage I Testicular Cancer Treatment of stage I testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma. Treatment of seminoma may include the following: - Surgery to remove the testicle, followed by surveillance. - For patients who want active treatment rather than surveillance, treatment may include: - - Surgery to remove the testicle, followed by chemotherapy. Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following: - Surgery to remove the testicle, with long-term follow-up. - Surgery to remove the testicle and lymph nodes in the abdomen, with long-term follow-up. - Surgery followed by chemotherapy for patients at high risk of recurrence, with long-term follow-up.

Hairy cell leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). Hairy cell leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This rare type of leukemia gets worse slowly or does not get worse at all. The disease is called hairy cell leukemia because the leukemia cells look \\"hairy\\" when viewed under a microscope. Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body. - White blood cells that fight infection and disease. - Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then into one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells): - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection. - T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make antibodies to help fight infection. - Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses. In hairy cell leukemia, too many blood stem cells become lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. They are also called leukemia cells. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. Some of the leukemia cells may collect in the spleen and cause it to swell. This summary is about hairy cell leukemia. See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia: - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment. - Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment. - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment. - Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment. - Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment. - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Hairy Cell Leukemia? ?","output":"Gender and age may affect the risk of hairy cell leukemia.

The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as a swollen spleen, lumps, or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. - Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for cells that look \\"hairy,\\" the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells. - Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. - Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see what type of cell it is. This test is done to diagnose the specific type of leukemia by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system. - Flow cytometry : A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. The cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. The measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light. - Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. - Gene mutation test: A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for mutations in the BRAF gene. A BRAF gene mutation is often found in patients with hairy cell leukemia. - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. A CT scan of the abdomen may be done to check for swollen lymph nodes or a swollen spleen."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Hairy Cell Leukemia ?","output":"Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).

These drugs may increase the risk of other types of cancer, especially Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Long-term follow up for second cancers is very important. Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Interferon alfa is a biologic agent commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia. See Drugs Approved for Hairy Cell Leukemia for more information. Surgery Splenectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the spleen. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used to treat hairy cell leukemia. Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. A monoclonal antibody called rituximab may be used for certain patients with hairy cell leukemia. Other types of targeted therapies are being studied. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.

An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and/or spinal cord. There are many types of brain and spinal cord tumors. The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord. Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). The tumors may be either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer): - Benign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues and may recur (come back). - Malignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue. When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors cause signs and symptoms and need treatment. Brain and spinal cord tumors can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview for more information on the treatment of children.) For information about lymphoma that begins in the brain, see the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment. A tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor. Tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the spine. They rarely spread to other parts of the body. Often, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain. These are called metastatic brain tumors (or brain metastases). Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors. Up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from lung cancer. Other types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include: - Melanoma. - Breast cancer. - Colon cancer. - Kidney cancer. - Nasopharyngeal cancer. - Cancer of unknown primary site. Cancer may spread to the leptomeninges (the two innermost membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). This is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The most common cancers that spread to the leptomeninges include: - Breast cancer. - Lung cancer. - Leukemia. - Lymphoma. See the following for more information from PDQ about cancers that commonly spread to the brain or spinal cord: - Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Breast Cancer Treatment - Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Treatment - Colon Cancer Treatment - Leukemia Home Page - Melanoma Treatment - Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment - Renal Cell Cancer Treatment - Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment The brain controls many important body functions. The brain has three major parts: - The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. - The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). It controls movement, balance, and posture. - The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord. It is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). The brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used to see, hear, walk, talk, and eat. The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body. The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch. There are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors. Brain and spinal cord tumors are named based on the type of cell they formed in and where the tumor first formed in the CNS. The grade of a tumor may be used to tell the difference between slow-growing and fast-growing types of the tumor. The World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grades are based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread. WHO Tumor Grading System - Grade I (low-grade) The tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade II, III, and IV tumor cells. They rarely spread into nearby tissues. Grade I brain tumors may be cured if they are completely removed by surgery. - Grade II The tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade III and IV tumor cells. They may spread into nearby tissue and may recur (come back). Some tumors may become a higher-grade tumor. - Grade III The tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade I and II tumor cells. They are likely to spread into nearby tissue. - Grade IV (high-grade) The tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly. There may be areas of dead cells in the tumor. Grade IV tumors usually cannot be cured. The following types of primary tumors can form in the brain or spinal cord: Astrocytic Tumors An astrocytic tumor begins in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An astrocyte is a type of glial cell. Glial cells sometimes form tumors called gliomas. Astrocytic tumors include the following: - Brain stem glioma (usually high grade): A brain stem glioma forms in the brain stem, which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord. It is often a high-grade tumor, which spreads widely through the brain stem and is hard to cure. Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain Stem Glioma Treatment for more information.) - Pineal astrocytic tumor (any grade): A pineal astrocytic tumor forms in tissue around the pineal gland and may be any grade. The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes melatonin, a hormone that helps control the sleeping and waking cycle. - Pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I): A pilocytic astrocytoma grows slowly in the brain or spinal cord. It may be in the form of a cyst and rarely spreads into nearby tissues. Pilocytic astrocytomas can often be cured. - Diffuse astrocytoma (grade II): A diffuse astrocytoma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, a diffuse astrocytoma can be cured. It is also called a low-grade diffuse astrocytoma. - Anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic astrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. An anaplastic astrocytoma is also called a malignant astrocytoma or high-grade astrocytoma. - Glioblastoma (grade IV): A glioblastoma grows and spreads very quickly. The tumor cells look very different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. It is also called glioblastoma multiforme. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about astrocytomas in children. Oligodendroglial Tumors An oligodendroglial tumor begins in brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An oligodendrocyte is a type of glial cell. Oligodendrocytes sometimes form tumors called oligodendrogliomas. Grades of oligodendroglial tumors include the following: - Oligodendroglioma (grade II): An oligodendroglioma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligodendroglioma can be cured. - Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III): An anaplastic oligodendroglioma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about oligodendroglial tumors in children. Mixed Gliomas A mixed glioma is a brain tumor that has two types of tumor cells in it oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This type of mixed tumor is called an oligoastrocytoma. - Oligoastrocytoma (grade II): An oligoastrocytoma is a slow-growing tumor. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligoastrocytoma can be cured. - Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor has a worse prognosis than oligoastrocytoma (grade II). See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about mixed gliomas in children. Ependymal Tumors An ependymal tumor usually begins in cells that line the fluid -filled spaces in the brain and around the spinal cord. An ependymal tumor may also be called an ependymoma. Grades of ependymomas include the following: - Ependymoma (grade I or II): A grade I or II ependymoma grows slowly and has cells that look something like normal cells. There are two types of grade I ependymoma myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma. A grade II ependymoma grows in a ventricle (fluid-filled space in the brain) and its connecting paths or in the spinal cord. In some cases, a grade I or II ependymoma can be cured. - Anaplastic ependymoma (grade III): An anaplastic ependymoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually has a worse prognosis than a grade I or II ependymoma. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Ependymoma Treatment for more information about ependymoma in children. Medulloblastomas A medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor. Medulloblastomas are most common in children or young adults. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment for more information about medulloblastomas in children. Pineal Parenchymal Tumors A pineal parenchymal tumor forms in parenchymal cells or pineocytes, which are the cells that make up most of the pineal gland. These tumors are different from pineal astrocytic tumors. Grades of pineal parenchymal tumors include the following: - Pineocytoma (grade II): A pineocytoma is a slow-growing pineal tumor. - Pineoblastoma (grade IV): A pineoblastoma is a rare tumor that is very likely to spread. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment for more information about pineal parenchymal tumors in children. Meningeal Tumors A meningeal tumor, also called a meningioma, forms in the meninges (thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord). It can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. Meningiomas are most common in adults. Types of meningeal tumors include the following: - Meningioma (grade I): A grade I meningioma is the most common type of meningeal tumor. A grade I meningioma is a slow-growing tumor. It forms most often in the dura mater. A grade I meningioma can be cured if it is completely removed by surgery. - Meningioma (grade II and III): This is a rare meningeal tumor. It grows quickly and is likely to spread within the brain and spinal cord. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery. A hemangiopericytoma is not a meningeal tumor but is treated like a grade II or III meningioma. A hemangiopericytoma usually forms in the dura mater. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery. Germ Cell Tumors A germ cell tumor forms in germ cells, which are the cells that develop into sperm in men or ova (eggs) in women. There are different types of germ cell tumors. These include germinomas, teratomas, embryonal yolk sac carcinomas, and choriocarcinomas. Germ cell tumors can be either benign or malignant. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information about childhood germ cell tumors in the brain. Craniopharyngioma (Grade I) A craniopharyngioma is a rare tumor that usually forms in the center of the brain just above the pituitary gland (a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands). Craniopharyngiomas can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Craniopharyngioma Treatment for more information about craniopharyngioma in children."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors? ?","output":"Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. There are few known risk factors for brain tumors. The following conditions may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors: - Being exposed to vinyl chloride may increase the risk of glioma. - Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, having AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), or receiving an organ transplant may increase the risk of primary CNS lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma for more information.) - Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk brain tumors: - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or 2 (NF2). - von Hippel-Lindau disease. - Tuberous sclerosis. - Li-Fraumeni syndrome. - Turcot syndrome type 1 or 2. - Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome."},{"instruction":"What causes Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?","output":"The cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?","output":"The signs and symptoms of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person. Signs and symptoms depend on the following: - Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord. - What the affected part of the brain controls. - The size of the tumor. Signs and symptoms may be caused by CNS tumors or by other conditions, including cancer that has spread to the brain. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Brain Tumor Symptoms - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting. - Seizures. - Vision, hearing, and speech problems. - Loss of appetite. - Frequent nausea and vomiting. - Changes in personality, mood, ability to focus, or behavior. - Loss of balance and trouble walking. - Weakness. - Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level. Spinal Cord Tumor Symptoms - Back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs. - A change in bowel habits or trouble urinating. - Weakness or numbness in the arms or legs. - Trouble walking."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?","output":"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. - Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight. - Tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. This test may be done to diagnose a germ cell tumor. - Gene testing : A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for changes in a chromosome that has been linked with a certain type of brain tumor. This test may be done to diagnose an inherited syndrome. - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). MRI is often used to diagnose tumors in the spinal cord. Sometimes a procedure called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the MRI scan. An MRS is used to diagnose tumors, based on their chemical make-up. - SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan. SPECT is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body. - PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body. A biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor. If imaging tests show there may be a brain tumor, a biopsy is usually done. One of the following types of biopsies may be used: - Stereotactic biopsy : When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place, a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done. This kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue. A small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull. A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. - Open biopsy : When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery, an open biopsy may be done. A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy. A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If cancer cells are found, some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery. Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function. There are also ways to test brain function during surgery. The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain. The pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread. The following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed: - Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. - Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells. - Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done. For some tumors, a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures. Sometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign and a biopsy is not done."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for primary brain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following: - The type and grade of the tumor. - Where the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord. - Whether the tumor can be removed by surgery. - Whether cancer cells remain after surgery. - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes. - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). - The patient's general health. The prognosis and treatment options for metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following: - Whether there are more than two tumors in the brain or spinal cord. - Where the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord. - How well the tumor responds to treatment. - Whether the primary tumor continues to grow or spread."},{"instruction":"What are the stages of Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?","output":"Key Points - There is no standard staging system for adult brain and spinal cord tumors. - Imaging tests may be repeated after surgery to help plan more treatment.

Brain tumors that begin in the brain may spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord, but they rarely spread to other parts of the body. Treatment of primary brain and spinal cord tumors is based on the following: - The type of cell in which the tumor began. - Where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. - The amount of cancer left after surgery. - The grade of the tumor. Treatment of tumors that have spread to the brain from other parts of the body is based on the number of tumors in the brain. Imaging tests may be repeated after surgery to help plan more treatment. Some of the tests and procedures used to diagnose a brain or spinal cord tumor may be repeated after treatment to find out how much tumor is left."},{"instruction":"what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?","output":"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Proton beam radiation therapy Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged pieces of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues. It is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and spine and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, and prostate. Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation. Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. Treatments may include the following: - Dendritic cell vaccine therapy. - Gene therapy. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Targeted therapy - Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Proton beam radiation therapy - Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors. Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Five types of standard treatment are used: Active surveillance Active surveillance is closely watching a patients condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery, which can cause side effects or other problems. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. Active surveillance may be used for very slow-growing tumors that do not cause symptoms. Surgery Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors. Removing tumor tissue helps decrease pressure of the tumor on nearby parts of the brain. See the General Information section of this summary. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following: - Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. - Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. - Stereotactic radiosurgery: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor. This procedure does not involve surgery. It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain or spinal cord. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult central nervous system tumors. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. To treat brain tumors, a wafer that dissolves may be used to deliver an anticancer drug directly to the brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain. Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill cancer cells there. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy. See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Bevacizumab is used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Other types of targeted therapies are being studied for adult brain tumors, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and new VEGF inhibitors. See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information. Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. This therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment and improves quality of life. For brain tumors, supportive care includes drugs to control seizures and fluid buildup or swelling in the brain. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. The following tests and procedures may be used to check whether a brain tumor has come back after treatment: - SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan. - PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.

Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas. The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies between the stomach and the spine. The pancreas has two main jobs in the body: - To make juices that help digest (break down) food. - To make hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, that help control blood sugar levels. Both of these hormones help the body use and store the energy it gets from food. The digestive juices are made by exocrine pancreas cells and the hormones are made by endocrine pancreas cells. About 95% of pancreatic cancers begin in exocrine cells. This summary is about exocrine pancreatic cancer. For information on endocrine pancreatic cancer, see the PDQ summary on Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Islet Cell Tumors) Treatment. For information on pancreatic cancer in children, see the PDQ summary on Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Pancreatic Cancer? ?","output":"Smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include the following: - Smoking. - Being very overweight. - Having a personal history of diabetes or chronic pancreatitis. - Having a family history of pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis. - Having certain hereditary conditions, such as: - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. - Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC; Lynch syndrome). - von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. - Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. - Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. - Familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer ?","output":"Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss. Pancreatic cancer may not cause early signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms may be caused by pancreatic cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). - Light-colored stools. - Dark urine. - Pain in the upper or middle abdomen and back. - Weight loss for no known reason. - Loss of appetite. - Feeling very tired. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons: - There arent any noticeable signs or symptoms in the early stages of pancreatic cancer. - The signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer, when present, are like the signs and symptoms of many other illnesses. - The pancreas is hidden behind other organs such as the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and bile ducts."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Pancreatic Cancer ?","output":"Tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed with tests and procedures that make pictures of the pancreas and the area around it. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the pancreas is called staging. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time. In order to plan treatment, it is important to know the stage of the disease and whether or not the pancreatic cancer can be removed by surgery. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as bilirubin, released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - Tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. A spiral or helical CT scan makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path. - PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT. - Abdominal ultrasound : An ultrasound exam used to make pictures of the inside of the abdomen. The ultrasound transducer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen and directs high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) into the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the internal tissues and organs and make echoes. The transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer, which uses the echoes to make pictures called sonograms. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or rectum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography. - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. A catheter (a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts. A dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. Tissue samples may also be taken. - Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. If a blockage is found, a thin, flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This test is done only if ERCP cannot be done. - Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. The laparoscope may have an ultrasound probe at the end in order to bounce high-energy sound waves off internal organs, such as the pancreas. This is called laparoscopic ultrasound. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples from the pancreas or a sample of fluid from the abdomen to check for cancer. - Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. There are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic cancer. A fine needle or a core needle may be inserted into the pancreas during an x-ray or ultrasound to remove cells. Tissue may also be removed during a laparoscopy."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Pancreatic Cancer ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. - The stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread outside the pancreas to nearby tissues or lymph nodes or to other places in the body). - The patients general health. - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). Pancreatic cancer can be controlled only if it is found before it has spread, when it can be completely removed by surgery. If the cancer has spread, palliative treatment can improve the patient's quality of life by controlling the symptoms and complications of this disease."},{"instruction":"What are the stages of Pancreatic Cancer ?","output":"Key Points - Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose pancreatic cancer are often also used to stage the disease. See the General Information section for more information. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually pancreatic cancer cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic cancer, not liver cancer. The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the pancreas. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. Stage I In stage I, cancer has formed and is found in the pancreas only. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, based on the size of the tumor. - Stage IA: The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. - Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters. Stage II In stage II, cancer may have spread to nearby tissue and organs, and may have spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, based on where the cancer has spread. - Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to nearby tissue and organs but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes. - Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and may have spread to nearby tissue and organs. Stage III In stage III, cancer has spread to the major blood vessels near the pancreas and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage IV In stage IV, cancer may be of any size and has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lung, and peritoneal cavity. It may have also spread to organs and tissues near the pancreas or to lymph nodes."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Pancreatic Cancer ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Chemoradiation therapy - Targeted therapy - There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. - Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. Different types of treatment are available for patients with pancreatic cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery One of the following types of surgery may be used to take out the tumor: - Whipple procedure: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to produce digestive juices and insulin. - Total pancreatectomy: This operation removes the whole pancreas, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, the common bile duct, the gallbladder, the spleen, and nearby lymph nodes. - Distal pancreatectomy: The body and the tail of the pancreas and usually the spleen are removed. If the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life: - Surgical biliary bypass: If cancer is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. During this operation, the doctor will cut the gallbladder or bile duct and sew it to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area. - Endoscopic stent placement: If the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area. The doctor may place the stent through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine. - Gastric bypass: If the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach, the stomach may be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat normally. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat pancreatic cancer. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information. Chemoradiation therapy Chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. Erlotinib is a type of TKI used to treat pancreatic cancer. See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information. There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Pain can occur when the tumor presses on nerves or other organs near the pancreas. When pain medicine is not enough, there are treatments that act on nerves in the abdomen to relieve the pain. The doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain. Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor. See the PDQ summary on Cancer Pain for more information. Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. Surgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make pancreatic enzymes that help to digest food. As a result, patients may have problems digesting food and absorbing nutrients into the body. To prevent malnutrition, the doctor may prescribe medicines that replace these enzymes. See the PDQ summary on Nutrition in Cancer Care for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Treatment Options by Stage Stages I and II Pancreatic Cancer Treatment of stage I and stage II pancreatic cancer may include the following: - Surgery. - Surgery followed by chemotherapy. - Surgery followed by chemoradiation. - A clinical trial of combination chemotherapy. - A clinical trial of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, with or without chemoradiation. - A clinical trial of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery.

Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system. Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system, part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following: - Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors. - Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream. - Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin. - Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. It is located on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach. - Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone. - Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes. - Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin. Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs. Lymphomas are divided into two general types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of adult Hodgkin lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.) Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children. Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); these patients require special treatment. See the following PDQ summaries for more information: - Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. However, treatment is different for pregnant women. This summary includes information about treating Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy. There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant. Most Hodgkin lymphomas are the classical type. The classical type is broken down into the following four subtypes: - Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma. - Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma. - Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma? ?","output":"Age, gender, and Epstein-Barr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma.

Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for adult Hodgkin lymphoma include the following: - Being in young or late adulthood. - Being male. - Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus. - Having a first-degree relative (parent, brother, or sister) with Hodgkin lymphoma. Pregnancy is not a risk factor for Hodgkin lymphoma."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?","output":"Signs of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adult Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if any of the following do not go away: - Painless, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, or groin. - Fever for no known reason. - Drenching night sweats. - Weight loss for no known reason. - Itchy skin. - Feeling very tired."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?","output":"Tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult Hodgkin lymphoma. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. - Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma or another condition. Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or ESR. - Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. One of the following types of biopsies may be done: - Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lymph node. - Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lymph node. - Core biopsy : The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The following test may be done on tissue that was removed: - Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - The patient's signs and symptoms. - The stage of the cancer. - The type of Hodgkin lymphoma. - Blood test results. - The patient's age, gender, and general health. - Whether the cancer is recurrent or progressive. For Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy, treatment options also depend on: - The wishes of the patient. - The age of the fetus. Adult Hodgkin lymphoma can usually be cured if found and treated early."},{"instruction":"what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?","output":"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. The use of lower-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is also being studied. Monoclonal antibody therapy Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials."},{"instruction":"What are the stages of Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?","output":"Key Points - After adult Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Stages of adult Hodgkin lymphoma may include A, B, E, and S. - The following stages are used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma: - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be grouped for treatment as follows: - Early Favorable - Early Unfavorable - Advanced After adult Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. For adult Hodgkin lymphoma, CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis are taken. - PET-CT scan : A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. For pregnant women with Hodgkin lymphoma, staging tests that protect the fetus from the harms of radiation are used. These include: - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). - Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Stages of adult Hodgkin lymphoma may include A, B, E, and S. Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows: - A: The patient does not have B symptoms (fever, weight loss, or night sweats). - B: The patient has B symptoms. - E: Cancer is found in an organ or tissue that is not part of the lymph system but which may be next to an involved area of the lymph system. - S: Cancer is found in the spleen. The following stages are used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma: Stage I Stage I is divided into stage I and stage IE. - Stage I: Cancer is found in one of the following places in the lymph system: - One or more lymph nodes in one lymph node group. - Waldeyer's ring. - Thymus. - Spleen. - Stage IE: Cancer is found outside the lymph system in one organ or area. Stage II Stage II is divided into stage II and stage IIE. - Stage II: Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen). - Stage IIE: Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area. Stage III Stage III is divided into stage III, stage IIIE, stage IIIS, and stage IIIE,S. - Stage III: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen). - Stage IIIE: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area. - Stage IIIS: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, and in the spleen. - Stage IIIE,S: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area, and in the spleen. Stage IV In stage IV, the cancer: - is found outside the lymph nodes throughout one or more organs, and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or - is found outside the lymph nodes in one organ and has spread to areas far away from that organ; or - is found in the lung, liver, bone marrow, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cancer has not spread to the lung, liver, bone marrow, or CSF from nearby areas. Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be grouped for treatment as follows: Early Favorable Early favorable adult Hodgkin lymphoma is stage I or stage II, without risk factors. Early Unfavorable Early unfavorable adult Hodgkin lymphoma is stage I or stage II with one or more of the following risk factors: - A tumor in the chest that is larger than 1/3 of the width of the chest or at least 10 centimeters. - Cancer in an organ other than the lymph nodes. - A high sedimentation rate (in a sample of blood, the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube more quickly than normal). - Three or more lymph nodes with cancer. - Symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Advanced Advanced Hodgkin lymphoma includes some or all of the following risk factors: - Being male. - Being aged 45 years or older. - Having stage IV disease. - Having a low blood albumin (protein) level (below 4). - Having a low hemoglobin level (below 10.5). - Having a high white blood cell count (15,000 or higher). - Having a low lymphocyte count (below 600 or less than 8% of the white blood cell count)."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma. - Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas. - Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. - Three types of standard treatment are used: - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Surgery - For pregnant patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment options also include: - Watchful waiting - Steroid therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant - Monoclonal antibody therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma. Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. For pregnant women with Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the fetus. Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes, the stage of the Hodgkin lymphoma, and the age of the fetus. The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms, cancer, and pregnancy change. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas. Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer. The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and expertise in treating adult Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists: - Neurosurgeon. - Neurologist. - Rehabilitation specialist. - Radiation oncologist. - Endocrinologist. - Hematologist. - Other oncology specialists. Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of second cancers and other health problems for many months or years after treatment. These late effects depend on the type of treatment and the patient's age when treated, and may include: - Acute myelogenous leukemia. - Cancer of the breast, bone, cervix, gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, lung, soft tissue, and thyroid. - Heart, lung, and thyroid disease. - Avascular necrosis of bone (death of bone cells caused by lack of blood flow). - Herpes zoster (shingles) or severe infection. - Depression and fatigue. - Infertility. - Hypogonadism (low levels of testosterone and estrogen). Regular follow-up by doctors who are expert in finding and treating late effects is important for the long-term health of patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma. Three types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Combination chemotherapy is treatment with more than one anticancer drug. When a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, it isn't possible to protect the fetus from being exposed to the chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester. Vinblastine is an anticancer drug that has not been linked with birth defects when given in the second half of pregnancy. See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult Hodgkin lymphoma. For a pregnant woman with Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be postponed until after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the fetus. If immediate treatment is needed, the woman may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy. However, lead used to shield the fetus may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future. Surgery Laparotomy is a procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. If cancer is found, the tissue or organ is removed during the laparotomy. For pregnant patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment options also include: Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change. Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old, so that the mother can begin treatment. Steroid therapy Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body by the adrenal glands and by reproductive organs. Some types of steroids are made in a laboratory. Certain steroid drugs have been found to help chemotherapy work better and help stop the growth of cancer cells. Steroids can also help the lungs of the fetus develop faster than normal. This is important when delivery is induced early. See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.

Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Treatment Options for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Early Favorable Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment of early favorable Hodgkin lymphoma may include the following: - Combination chemotherapy. - Combination chemotherapy with radiation therapy to parts of the body with cancer. - Radiation therapy alone to areas of the body with cancer or to the mantle field (neck, chest, armpits).

Treatment Options for Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy Hodgkin Lymphoma During the First Trimester of Pregnancy When Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy, it does not necessarily mean that the woman will be advised to end the pregnancy. Each woman's treatment will depend on the stage of the lymphoma, how fast it is growing, and her wishes. For women who choose to continue the pregnancy, treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during the first trimester of pregnancy may include the following: - Watchful waiting when the cancer is above the diaphragm and is slow-growing. Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old so the mother can begin treatment. - Radiation therapy above the diaphragm. (A lead shield is used to protect the fetus from the radiation as much as possible.) - Systemic chemotherapy using one or more drugs. Hodgkin Lymphoma During the Second Half of Pregnancy When Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy, most women can delay treatment until after the baby is born. Treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during the second half of pregnancy may include the following: - Watchful waiting, with plans to induce delivery when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old. - Systemic chemotherapy using one or more drugs. - Steroid therapy. - Radiation therapy to relieve breathing problems caused by a large tumor in the chest."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) ?","output":"Key Points - Bile duct cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the bile ducts. - Having colitis or certain liver diseases can increase the risk of bile duct cancer. - Signs of bile duct cancer include jaundice and pain in the abdomen. - Tests that examine the bile ducts and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage bile duct cancer. - Different procedures may be used to obtain a sample of tissue and diagnose bile duct cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Bile duct cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the bile ducts. A network of tubes, called ducts, connects the liver, gallbladder, and small intestine. This network begins in the liver where many small ducts collect bile (a fluid made by the liver to break down fats during digestion). The small ducts come together to form the right and left hepatic ducts, which lead out of the liver. The two ducts join outside the liver and form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct connects the gallbladder to the common hepatic duct. Bile from the liver passes through the hepatic ducts, common hepatic duct, and cystic duct and is stored in the gallbladder. When food is being digested, bile stored in the gallbladder is released and passes through the cystic duct to the common bile duct and into the small intestine. Bile duct cancer is also called cholangiocarcinoma. There are two types of bile duct cancer: - Intrahepatic bile duct cancer : This type of cancer forms in the bile ducts inside the liver. Only a small number of bile duct cancers are intrahepatic. Intrahepatic bile duct cancers are also called intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. - Extrahepatic bile duct cancer : The extrahepatic bile duct is made up of the hilum region and the distal region. Cancer can form in either region: - Perihilar bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the hilum region, the area where the right and left bile ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct. Perihilar bile duct cancer is also called a Klatskin tumor or perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. - Distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the distal region. The distal region is made up of the common bile duct which passes through the pancreas and ends in the small intestine. Distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer is also called extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma)? ?","output":"Having colitis or certain liver diseases can increase the risk of bile duct cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. People who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor. Risk factors for bile duct cancer include the following conditions: - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (a progressive disease in which the bile ducts become blocked by inflammation and scarring). - Chronic ulcerative colitis. - Cysts in the bile ducts (cysts block the flow of bile and can cause swollen bile ducts, inflammation, and infection). - Infection with a Chinese liver fluke parasite."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) ?","output":"Signs of bile duct cancer include jaundice and pain in the abdomen.

Procedures that make pictures of the bile ducts and the nearby area help diagnose bile duct cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the bile ducts or to distant parts of the body is called staging. In order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the bile duct cancer can be removed by surgery. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage bile duct cancer are usually done at the same time. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of these substances can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by bile duct cancer. - Laboratory tests : Medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body. These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time. - Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. Higher than normal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 may mean there is bile duct cancer. - Ultrasound exam : A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the abdomen, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.

Different procedures may be used to obtain a sample of tissue and diagnose bile duct cancer. Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Different procedures may be used to obtain the sample of cells and tissue. The type of procedure used depends on whether the patient is well enough to have surgery. Types of biopsy procedures include the following: - Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen, such as the bile ducts and liver, to check for signs of cancer. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples to be checked for signs of cancer. - Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. A sample of tissue is removed and checked for signs of cancer. If the bile duct is blocked, a thin, flexible tube called a stent may be left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This procedure may be used when a patient cannot have surgery. - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes bile duct cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope is passed through the mouth and stomach and into the small intestine. Dye is injected through the endoscope (thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing) into the bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. A sample of tissue is removed and checked for signs of cancer. If the bile duct is blocked, a thin tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open.

Treatment options may also depend on the symptoms caused by the cancer. Bile duct cancer is usually found after it has spread and can rarely be completely removed by surgery. Palliative therapy may relieve symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life."},{"instruction":"what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) ?","output":"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Liver transplant In a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed and replaced with a healthy donated liver. A liver transplant may be done in patients with perihilar bile duct cancer. If the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.

The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. For bile duct cancer, the information gathered from tests and procedures is used to plan treatment, including whether the tumor can be removed by surgery. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if bile duct cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually bile duct cancer cells. The disease is metastatic bile duct cancer, not liver cancer. Stages are used to describe the different types of bile duct cancer. Intrahepatic bile duct cancer - Stage 0: Abnormal cells are found in the innermost layer of tissue lining the intrahepatic bile duct. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. - Stage I: There is one tumor that has spread into the intrahepatic bile duct and it has not spread into any blood vessels. - Stage II: There is one tumor that has spread through the wall of the bile duct and into a blood vessel, or there are multiple tumors that may have spread into a blood vessel. - Stage III: The tumor has spread through the tissue that lines the abdominal wall or has spread to organs or tissues near the liver such as the duodenum, colon, and stomach. - Stage IV: Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB. - Stage IVA: The cancer has spread along the outside of the intrahepatic bile ducts or the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. - Stage IVB: The cancer has spread to organs in other parts of the body. Perihilar bile duct cancer - Stage 0: Abnormal cells are found in the innermost layer of tissue lining the perihilar bile duct. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. - Stage I: Cancer has formed in the innermost layer of the wall of the perihilar bile duct and has spread into the muscle layer or fibrous tissue layer of the wall. - Stage II: Cancer has spread through the wall of the perihilar bile duct to nearby fatty tissue or to the liver. - Stage III: Stage III is divided into stage IIIA and stage IIIB. - Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to branches on one side of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein. - Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Cancer may have spread into the wall of the perihilar bile duct or through the wall to nearby fatty tissue, the liver, or to branches on one side of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein. - Stage IV: Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB. - Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to one or more of the following: - the main part of the portal vein and/or common hepatic artery; - the branches of the portal vein and/or common hepatic artery on both sides; - the right hepatic duct and the left branch of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein; - the left hepatic duct and the right branch of the hepatic artery or of the portal vein. Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. - Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in more distant parts of the abdomen, or to organs in other parts of the body. Distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer - Stage 0: Abnormal cells are found in the innermost layer of tissue lining the distal extrahepatic bile duct. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. - Stage I: Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB. - Stage IA: Cancer has formed and is found in the distal extrahepatic bile duct wall only. - Stage IB: Cancer has formed and has spread through the wall of the distal extrahepatic bile duct but has not spread to nearby organs. - Stage II: Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB. - Stage IIA: Cancer has spread from the distal extrahepatic bile duct to the gallbladder, pancreas, duodenum, or other nearby organs. - Stage IIB: Cancer has spread from the distal extrahepatic bile duct to nearby lymph nodes. Cancer may have spread through the wall of the duct or to nearby organs. - Stage III: Cancer has spread to the large vessels that carry blood to the organs in the abdomen. Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. - Stage IV: Cancer has spread to organs in distant parts of the body. The following groups are used to plan treatment: Resectable (localized) bile duct cancer The cancer is in an area, such as the lower part of the common bile duct or perihilar area, where it can be removed completely by surgery. Unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer Unresectable cancer cannot be removed completely by surgery. Most patients with bile duct cancer cannot have their cancer completely removed by surgery. Metastasis is the spread of cancer from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body. Metastatic bile duct cancer may have spread to the liver, other parts of the abdominal cavity, or to distant parts of the body. Recurrent bile duct cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the bile ducts, liver, or gallbladder. Less often, it may come back in distant parts of the body."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with bile duct cancer. - Three types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Liver transplant - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with bile duct cancer. Different types of treatments are available for patients with bile duct cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Three types of standard treatment are used: Surgery The following types of surgery are used to treat bile duct cancer: - Removal of the bile duct: A surgical procedure to remove part of the bile duct if the tumor is small and in the bile duct only. Lymph nodes are removed and tissue from the lymph nodes is viewed under a microscope to see if there is cancer. - Partial hepatectomy: A surgical procedure in which the part of the liver where cancer is found is removed. The part removed may be a wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with some normal tissue around it. - Whipple procedure: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy or radiation therapy given after surgery helps keep the cancer from coming back. The following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms caused by a blocked bile duct and improve quality of life: - Biliary bypass: A surgical procedure in which the part of the bile duct before the blockage is connected with part of the bile duct that is past the blockage or to the small intestine. This allows bile to flow to the gallbladder or small intestine. - Stent placement: A surgical procedure in which a stent (a thin, flexible tube or metal tube) is placed in the bile duct to open it and allow bile to flow into the small intestine or through a catheter that goes to a collection bag outside of the body. - Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage: A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the bile duct is blocked, a thin, flexible tube called a stent may be left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat bile duct cancer. It is not yet known whether external radiation therapy helps in the treatment of resectable bile duct cancer. In unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer, new ways to improve the effect of external radiation therapy on cancer cells are being studied: - Hyperthermia therapy: A treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy and certain anticancer drugs. - Radiosensitizers: Drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more cancer cells. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Systemic chemotherapy is used to treat unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer. It is not yet known whether systemic chemotherapy helps in the treatment of resectable bile duct cancer. In unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer, intra-arterial embolization is being studied. It is a procedure in which the blood supply to a tumor is blocked after anticancer drugs are given in blood vessels near the tumor. Sometimes, the anticancer drugs are attached to small beads that are injected into an artery that feeds the tumor. The beads block blood flow to the tumor as they release the drug. This allows a higher amount of drug to reach the tumor for a longer period of time, which may kill more cancer cells. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Liver transplant In a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed and replaced with a healthy donated liver.

These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Treatment Options for Bile Duct Cancer Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer Resectable Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer Treatment of resectable intrahepatic bile duct cancer may include: - Surgery to remove the cancer, which may include partial hepatectomy. Embolization may be done before surgery. - Surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Intraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye. Intraocular melanoma begins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer includes the white sclera (the \\"white of the eye\\") and the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The inner layer has a lining of nerve tissue, called the retina, which senses light and sends images along the optic nerve to the brain. The middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called the uvea or uveal tract, and has three main parts: - Iris The iris is the colored area at the front of the eye (the \\"eye color\\"). It can be seen through the clear cornea. The pupil is in the center of the iris and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small tumor that grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body. - Ciliary body The ciliary body is a ring of tissue with muscle fibers that change the size of the pupil and the shape of the lens. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris. Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris. - Choroid The choroid is a layer of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the eye. Most intraocular melanomas begin in the choroid. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris. Intraocular melanoma is a rare cancer that forms from cells that make melanin in the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It is the most common eye cancer in adults."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma? ?","output":"Being older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following: - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following: - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly. - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes. - Older age. - Being white."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?","output":"Signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris. Intraocular melanoma may not cause early signs or symptoms. It is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor dilates the pupil and looks into the eye. Signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: - Blurred vision or other change in vision. - Floaters (spots that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light. - A dark spot on the iris. - A change in the size or shape of the pupil. - A change in the position of the eyeball in the eye socket."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?","output":"Tests that examine the eye are used to help detect (find) and diagnose intraocular melanoma. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Eye exam with dilated pupil: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor. There are several types of eye exams: - Ophthalmoscopy : An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light. - Slit-lamp biomicroscopy : An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope. - Gonioscopy : An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. A special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked. - Ultrasound exam of the eye: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a sonogram, shows on the screen of the ultrasound monitor. - High-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy : A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a more detailed picture of the inside of the eye than a regular ultrasound. The tumor is checked for its size, shape, and thickness, and for signs that the tumor has spread to nearby tissue. - Transillumination of the globe and iris: An exam of the iris, cornea, lens, and ciliary body with a light placed on either the upper or lower lid. - Fluorescein angiography : A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye. An orange fluorescent dye (fluorescein) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. - Indocyanine green angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. A green dye (indocyanine green) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. - Ocular coherence tomography : An imaging test that uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina, and sometimes the choroid, to see if there is swelling or fluid beneath the retina. A biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma. A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Rarely, a biopsy of the tumor is needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma. Tissue that is removed during a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor may be tested to get more information about prognosis and which treatment options are best. The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue: - Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. - Gene expression profiling : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked for certain types of RNA. A biopsy may result in retinal detachment (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye). This can be repaired by surgery."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - How the melanoma cells look under a microscope. - The size and thickness of the tumor. - The part of the eye the tumor is in (the iris, ciliary body, or choroid). - Whether the tumor has spread within the eye or to other places in the body. - Whether there are certain changes in the genes linked to intraocular melanoma. - The patient's age and general health. - Whether the tumor has recurred (come back) after treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the stages of Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?","output":"Key Points - After intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. - The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma: - Small - Medium - Large - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - There are two staging systems for intraocular melanoma. - The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the iris: - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid: - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV After intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: - Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver. - Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. - Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found. The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma: Small The tumor is 5 to 16 millimeters in diameter and from 1 to 3 millimeters thick. Medium The tumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and from 3.1 to 8 millimeters thick. Large The tumor is: - more than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or - at least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter. Though most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat. These diffuse tumors grow widely across the uvea. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not liver cancer. There are two staging systems for intraocular melanoma. Intraocular melanoma has two staging systems. The staging system used depends on where in the eye the cancer first formed: - Iris. - Ciliary body and choroid. If intraocular melanoma spreads to the optic nerve or nearby tissue of the eye socket, it is called extraocular extension. The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the iris: Stage I In stage I, the tumor is in the iris only and is not more than one fourth the size of the iris. Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB. - In stage IIA, the tumor: - is in the iris only and is more than one fourth the size of the iris; or - is in the iris only and has caused glaucoma; or - has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both. The tumor has caused glaucoma. - In stage IIB, the tumor has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both, and has also spread into the sclera. The tumor has caused glaucoma. Stage III Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB. - In stage IIIA, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. - In stage IIIB, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is more than 5 millimeters thick. Stage IV In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread: - to nearby lymph nodes; or - to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, or bone, or to areas under the skin. The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid: Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid is grouped into four size categories. The category depends on how wide and thick the tumor is. Category 1 tumors are the smallest and category 4 tumors are the biggest. Category 1: - The tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or - the tumor is not more than 9 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick. Category 2: - The tumor is 12.1 to 18 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or - the tumor is 9.1 to 15 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick; or - the tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and 6.1 to 9 millimeters thick. Category 3: - The tumor is 15.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick; or - the tumor is 12.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 6.1 to 9 millimeters thick; or - the tumor is 3.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 9.1 to 12 millimeters thick; or - the tumor is 9.1 to 15 millimeters wide and 12.1 to 15 millimeters thick. Category 4: - The tumor is more than 18 millimeters wide and may be any thickness; or - the tumor is 15.1 to 18 millimeters wide and more than 12 millimeters thick; or - the tumor is 12.1 to 15 millimeters wide and more than 15 millimeters thick.

Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB. - In stage IIA, the tumor: - is size category 1 and has spread to the ciliary body; or - is size category 1 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor may have spread to the ciliary body; or - is size category 2 and is in the choroid only. - In stage IIB, the tumor: - is size category 2 and has spread to the ciliary body; or - is size category 3 and is in the choroid only. Stage III Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC. - In stage IIIA, the tumor: - is size category 2 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor may have spread to the ciliary body; or - is size category 3 and has spread to the ciliary body; or - is size category 3 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball.

Stage IV In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread: - to nearby lymph nodes; or - to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, or bone, or to areas under the skin."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatments for patients with intraocular melanoma. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Watchful Waiting - Radiation therapy - Photocoagulation - Thermotherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Treatment for intraocular (uveal) melanoma may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatments for patients with intraocular melanoma. Different types of treatments are available for patients with intraocular melanoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery is the most common treatment for intraocular melanoma. The following types of surgery may be used: - Resection: Surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue around it. - Enucleation: Surgery to remove the eye and part of the optic nerve. This is done if vision cannot be saved and the tumor is large, has spread to the optic nerve, or causes high pressure inside the eye. After surgery, the patient is usually fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye. - Exenteration: Surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and muscles, nerves, and fat in the eye socket. After surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial prosthesis. Watchful Waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Pictures are taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor and how fast it is growing. Watchful waiting is used for patients who do not have signs or symptoms and the tumor is not growing. It is also used when the tumor is in the only eye with useful vision. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following: - Charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy. A special radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called protons or helium ions, at the cancer cells to kill them with little damage to nearby normal tissues. Charged-particle radiation therapy uses a different type of radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy. - Gamma Knife therapy is a type of stereotactic radiosurgery used for some melanomas. This treatment can be given in one treatment. It aims tightly focused gamma rays directly at the tumor so there is little damage to healthy tissue. Gamma Knife therapy does not use a knife to remove the tumor and is not an operation. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following: - Localized plaque radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used for tumors of the eye. Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the eye near the tumor. The side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. The plaque helps protect other nearby tissue from the radiation. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat intraocular melanoma. Photocoagulation Photocoagulation is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. Photocoagulation may be used to treat small tumors. This is also called light coagulation. Thermotherapy Thermotherapy is the use of heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Treatment for intraocular (uveal) melanoma may cause side effects. For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

Non-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung. The lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs in the chest. The lungs bring oxygen into the body as you breathe in. They release carbon dioxide, a waste product of the bodys cells, as you breathe out. Each lung has sections called lobes. The left lung has two lobes. The right lung is slightly larger and has three lobes. Two tubes called bronchi lead from the trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. The bronchi are sometimes also involved in lung cancer. Tiny air sacs called alveoli and small tubes called bronchioles make up the inside of the lungs. A thin membrane called the pleura covers the outside of each lung and lines the inside wall of the chest cavity. This creates a sac called the pleural cavity. The pleural cavity normally contains a small amount of fluid that helps the lungs move smoothly in the chest when you breathe. There are two main types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. See the following PDQ summaries for more information about lung cancer: - Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment - Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment - Lung Cancer Prevention - Lung Cancer Screening There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer. Each type of non-small cell lung cancer has different kinds of cancer cells. The cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways. The types of non-small cell lung cancer are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look under a microscope: - Squamous cell carcinoma: Cancer that begins in squamous cells, which are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales. This is also called epidermoid carcinoma. - Large cell carcinoma: Cancer that may begin in several types of large cells. - Adenocarcinoma: Cancer that begins in the cells that line the alveoli and make substances such as mucus. Other less common types of non-small cell lung cancer are: pleomorphic, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma. For most patients with non-small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. If lung cancer is found, taking part in one of the many clinical trials being done to improve treatment should be considered. Clinical trials are taking place in most parts of the country for patients with all stages of non-small cell lung cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer? ?","output":"Smoking is the major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for lung cancer. Risk factors for lung cancer include the following: - Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars, now or in the past. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer. - Being exposed to secondhand smoke. - Being exposed to radiation from any of the following: - Radiation therapy to the breast or chest. - Radon in the home or workplace. - Imaging tests such as CT scans. - Atomic bomb radiation. - Being exposed to asbestos, chromium, nickel, beryllium, arsenic, soot, or tar in the workplace. - Living where there is air pollution. - Having a family history of lung cancer. - Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). - Taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker. Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older. When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer ?","output":"Signs of non-small cell lung cancer include a cough that doesn't go away and shortness of breath.

Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: - Chest discomfort or pain. - A cough that doesnt go away or gets worse over time. - Trouble breathing. - Wheezing. - Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs). - Hoarseness. - Loss of appetite. - Weight loss for no known reason. - Feeling very tired. - Trouble swallowing. - Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer ?","output":"Tests that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage non-small cell lung cancer. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage non-small cell lung cancer are often done at the same time. Some of the following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits, including smoking, and past jobs, illnesses, and treatments will also be taken. - Laboratory tests : Medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body. These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time. - Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - Sputum cytology : A procedure in which a pathologist views a sample of sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) under a microscope, to check for cancer cells. - Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung: The removal of tissue or fluid from the lung using a thin needle. A CT scan, ultrasound, or other imaging procedure is used to locate the abnormal tissue or fluid in the lung. A small incision may be made in the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue or fluid. A sample is removed with the needle and sent to the laboratory. A pathologist then views the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells. A chest x-ray is done after the procedure to make sure no air is leaking from the lung into the chest. - Bronchoscopy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. - Thoracoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs, and a thoracoscope is inserted into the chest. A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the esophagus or lung. If certain tissues, organs, or lymph nodes cant be reached, a thoracotomy may be done. In this procedure, a larger incision is made between the ribs and the chest is opened. - Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells. - Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells. - Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Some of the tests used to diagnose non-small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.) Other tests and procedures that may be used in the staging process include the following: - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain and abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - Radionuclide bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner. - Pulmonary function test (PFT): A test to see how well the lungs are working. It measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs. It also measures how much oxygen is used and how much carbon dioxide is given off during breathing. This is also called lung function test. - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography. EUS may be used to guide fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung, lymph nodes, or other areas. - Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. - Anterior mediastinotomy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This is also called the Chamberlain procedure. - Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if non-small cell lung cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells in the brain are actually lung cancer cells. The disease is metastatic lung cancer, not brain cancer. The following stages are used for non-small cell lung cancer: Occult (hidden) stage In the occult (hidden) stage, cancer cannot be seen by imaging or bronchoscopy. Cancer cells are found in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) or bronchial washing (a sample of cells taken from inside the airways that lead to the lung). Cancer may have spread to other parts of the body. Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the airways. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. Stage I In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB: - Stage IA: The tumor is in the lung only and is 3 centimeters or smaller. - Stage IB: Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true: - The tumor is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. - Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus. - Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung. - Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus. Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.

There are different types of treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Different types of treatments are available for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Nine types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Four types of surgery are used to treat lung cancer: - Wedge resection: Surgery to remove a tumor and some of the normal tissue around it. When a slightly larger amount of tissue is taken, it is called a segmental resection. - Lobectomy: Surgery to remove a whole lobe (section) of the lung. - Pneumonectomy: Surgery to remove one whole lung. - Sleeve resection: Surgery to remove part of the bronchus. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy used to treat lung cancer that has spread to the brain. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor in the brain. This procedure does not involve surgery. It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery. For tumors in the airways, radiation is given directly to the tumor through an endoscope. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. It also depends on where the cancer is found. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. See Drugs Approved for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer for more information. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the two main types of targeted therapy being used to treat advanced, metastatic, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances in the blood or tissues that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. There are different types of monoclonal antibody therapy: - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapy: Cancer cells make a substance called VEGF, which causes new blood vessels to form (angiogenesis) and helps the cancer grow. VEGF inhibitors block VEGF and stop new blood vessels from forming. This may kill cancer cells because they need new blood vessels to grow. Bevacizumab and ramucirumab are VEGF inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors. - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor therapy: EGFRs are proteins found on the surface of certain cells, including cancer cells. Epidermal growth factor attaches to the EGFR on the surface of the cell and causes the cells to grow and divide. EGFR inhibitors block the receptor and stop the epidermal growth factor from attaching to the cancer cell. This stops the cancer cell from growing and dividing. Cetuximab and necitumumab are EGFR inhibitors. - Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When PD-1 attaches to another protein called PDL-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 inhibitors attach to PDL-1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab are types of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small-molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. Some tyrosine kinase inhibitors also have angiogenesis inhibitor effects. There are different types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors: - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors: EGFRs are proteins found on the surface and inside certain cells, including cancer cells. Epidermal growth factor attaches to the EGFR inside the cell and sends signals to the tyrosine kinase area of the cell, which tells the cell to grow and divide. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors stop these signals and stop the cancer cell from growing and dividing. Erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib are types of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some of these drugs work better when there is also a mutation (change) in the EGFR gene. - Kinase inhibitors that affect cells with certain gene changes: Certain changes in the ALK and ROS1 genes cause too much protein to be made. Blocking these proteins may stop the cancer from growing and spreading. Crizotinib is used to stop proteins from being made by the ALK and ROS1 gene. Ceritinib is used to stop proteins from being made by the ALK gene. See Drugs Approved for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer for more information. Laser therapy Laser therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) to kill cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. Fiberoptic tubes are then used to carry the laser light to the cancer cells, where the drug becomes active and kills the cells. Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue. It is used mainly to treat tumors on or just under the skin or in the lining of internal organs. When the tumor is in the airways, PDT is given directly to the tumor through an endoscope. Cryosurgery Cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue, such as carcinoma in situ. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. For tumors in the airways, cryosurgery is done through an endoscope. Electrocautery Electrocautery is a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue. For tumors in the airways, electrocautery is done through an endoscope. Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. This may be done in certain rare cases of non-small cell lung cancer. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Chemoprevention Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other substances to reduce the risk of cancer or to reduce the risk cancer will recur (come back). For lung cancer, chemoprevention is used to lessen the chance that a new tumor will form in the lung. Radiosensitizers Radiosensitizers are substances that make tumor cells easier to kill with radiation therapy. The combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy given with a radiosensitizer is being studied in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. New combinations New combinations of treatments are being studied in clinical trials. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

Ovarian low malignant potential tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissue covering the ovary. Ovarian low malignant potential tumors have abnormal cells that may become cancer, but usually do not. This disease usually remains in the ovary. When disease is found in one ovary, the other ovary should also be checked carefully for signs of disease. The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and female hormones."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ?","output":"Signs and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.Ovarian low malignant potential tumor may not cause early signs or symptoms. If you do have signs or symptoms, they may include the following: - Pain or swelling in the abdomen. - Pain in the pelvis. - Gastrointestinal problems, such as gas, bloating, or constipation.

The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas. - Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.Other patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound. - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - CA 125 assay : A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition. - Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during surgery to remove the tumor."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - The stage of the disease (whether it affects part of the ovary, involves the whole ovary, or has spread to other places in the body). - What type of cells make up the tumor. - The size of the tumor. - The patients general health.

The process used to find out whether abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests or procedures are used for staging. Staging laparotomy (a surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen to remove ovarian tissue) may be used. Most patients are diagnosed with stage I disease. The following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor: Stage I In stage I, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC. - Stage IA: The tumor is found inside a single ovary. - Stage IB: The tumor is found inside both ovaries. - Stage IC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries and one of the following is true: - tumor cells are found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or - the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has ruptured (broken open); or - tumor cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity). Stage II In stage II, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries and has spread into other areas of the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC. - Stage IIA: The tumor has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes (the long slender tubes through which eggs pass from the ovaries to the uterus). - Stage IIB: The tumor has spread to other tissue within the pelvis. - Stage IIC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries and has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes, or to other tissue within the pelvis. Also, one of the following is true: - tumor cells are found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or - the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has ruptured (broken open); or - tumor cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity). Stage III In stage III, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries and has spread outside the pelvis to other parts of the abdomen and/or nearby lymph nodes. Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC. - Stage IIIA: The tumor is found in the pelvis only, but tumor cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum (tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the organs in the abdomen), the small intestines, or the tissue that connects the small intestines to the wall of the abdomen. - Stage IIIB: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum and the tumor in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller. - Stage IIIC: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum and the tumor in the peritoneum is larger than 2 centimeters and/or has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen. The spread of tumor cells to the surface of the liver is also considered stage III disease. Stage IV In stage IV, tumor cells have spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or tissue inside the liver. Tumor cells in the fluid around the lungs is also considered stage IV disease. Ovarian low malignant potential tumors almost never reach stage IV."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low malignant potential tumor. - Two types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Chemotherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low malignant potential tumor. Different types of treatment are available for patients with ovarian low malignant potential tumor. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer, tumors, and related conditions. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Two types of standard treatment are used: Surgery The type of surgery (removing the tumor in an operation) depends on the size and spread of the tumor and the womans plans for having children. Surgery may include the following: - Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube. - Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. - Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and both ovaries and fallopian tubes. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. - Partial oophorectomy: Surgery to remove part of one ovary or part of both ovaries. - Omentectomy: Surgery to remove the omentum (a piece of the tissue lining the abdominal wall). Even if the doctor removes all disease that can be seen at the time of the operation, the patient may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any tumor cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the tumor will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the medical research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for disease are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose disease has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's clinical trials database. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the disease may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called re-staging. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the disease has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Treatment Options for Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors Early Stage Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors (Stage I and II) Surgery is the standard treatment for early stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor. The type of surgery usually depends on whether a woman plans to have children. For women who plan to have children, surgery is either: - unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; or - partial oophorectomy. To prevent recurrence of disease, most doctors recommend surgery to remove the remaining ovarian tissue when a woman no longer plans to have children. For women who do not plan to have children, treatment may be hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

Osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in bone. Osteosarcoma usually starts in osteoblasts, which are a type of bone cell that becomes new bone tissue. Osteosarcoma is most common in adolescents. It commonly forms in the ends of the long bones of the body, which include bones of the arms and legs. In children and adolescents, it often forms in the bones near the knee. Rarely, osteosarcoma may be found in soft tissue or organs in the chest or abdomen. Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone is a rare tumor of the bone. It is treated like osteosarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is another kind of bone cancer, but it is not covered in this summary. See the PDQ summary about Ewing Sarcoma Treatment for more information."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone? ?","output":"Having past treatment with radiation can increase the risk of osteosarcoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Risk factors for osteosarcoma include the following: - Past treatment with radiation therapy. - Past treatment with anticancer drugs called alkylating agents. - Having a certain change in the retinoblastoma gene. - Having certain conditions, such as the following: - Bloom syndrome. - Diamond-Blackfan anemia. - Li-Fraumeni syndrome. - Paget disease. - Hereditary retinoblastoma. - Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. - Werner syndrome."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone ?","output":"Signs and symptoms of osteosarcoma and MFH include swelling over a bone or a bony part of the body and joint pain. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by osteosarcoma or MFH or by other conditions. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following: - Swelling over a bone or bony part of the body. - Pain in a bone or joint. - A bone that breaks for no known reason."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone ?","output":"Imaging tests are used to detect (find) osteosarcoma and MFH. Imaging tests are done before the biopsy. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - X-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). A biopsy is done to diagnose osteosarcoma. Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. It is important that the biopsy be done by a surgeon who is an expert in treating cancer of the bone. It is best if that surgeon is also the one who removes the tumor. The biopsy and the surgery to remove the tumor are planned together. The way the biopsy is done affects which type of surgery can be done later. The type of biopsy that is done will be based on the size of the tumor and where it is in the body. There are two types of biopsy that may be used: - Core biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle. - Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn't look normal. The following test may be done on the tissue that is removed: - Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) is affected by certain factors before and after treatment. The prognosis of untreated osteosarcoma and MFH depends on the following: - Where the tumor is in the body and whether tumors formed in more than one bone. - The size of the tumor. - Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and where it has spread. - The type of tumor (based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope). - The patient's age and weight at diagnosis. - Whether the tumor has caused a break in the bone. - Whether the patient has certain genetic diseases. After osteosarcoma or MFH is treated, prognosis also depends on the following: - How much of the cancer was killed by chemotherapy. - How much of the tumor was taken out by surgery. - Whether chemotherapy is delayed for more than 3 weeks after surgery takes place. - Whether the cancer has recurred (come back) within 2 years of diagnosis. Treatment options for osteosarcoma and MFH depend on the following: - Where the tumor is in the body. - The size of the tumor. - The stage of the cancer. - Whether the bones are still growing. - The patient's age and general health. - The desire of the patient and family for the patient to be able to participate in activities such as sports or have a certain appearance. - Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred after treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the stages of Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone ?","output":"Key Points - After osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - Osteosarcoma and MFH are described as either localized or metastatic. After osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. For osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), most patients are grouped according to whether cancer is found in only one part of the body or has spread. The following tests and procedures may be used: - X-ray : An x-ray of the organs, such as the chest, and bones inside the body. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. X-rays will be taken of the chest and the area where the tumor formed. - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Pictures will be taken of the chest and the area where the tumor formed. - PET-CT scan : A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). - Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if osteosarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually osteosarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic osteosarcoma, not lung cancer. Osteosarcoma and MFH are described as either localized or metastatic. - Localized osteosarcoma or MFH has not spread out of the bone where the cancer started. There may be one or more areas of cancer in the bone that can be removed during surgery. - Metastatic osteosarcoma or MFH has spread from the bone in which the cancer began to other parts of the body. The cancer most often spreads to the lungs. It may also spread to other bones."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone. - Children with osteosarcoma or MFH should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children. - Treatment for osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma may cause side effects. - Four types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Samarium - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Targeted therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone. Different types of treatment are available for children with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Children with osteosarcoma or MFH should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating osteosarcoma and MFH and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists: - Pediatrician. - Orthopedic surgeon. - Radiation oncologist. - Rehabilitation specialist. - Pediatric nurse specialist. - Social worker. - Psychologist. Treatment for osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma may cause side effects. For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following: - Physical problems. - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. - Second cancers (new types of cancer). Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information). Four types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery to remove the entire tumor will be done when possible. Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to make the tumor smaller. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is given so less bone tissue needs to be removed and there are fewer problems after surgery. The following types of surgery may be done: - Wide local excision: Surgery to remove the cancer and some healthy tissue around it. - Limb-sparing surgery: Removal of the tumor in a limb (arm or leg) without amputation, so the use and appearance of the limb is saved. Most patients with osteosarcoma in a limb can be treated with limb-sparing surgery. The tumor is removed by wide local excision. Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft using tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body, or with an implant such as artificial bone. If a fracture is found at diagnosis or during chemotherapy before surgery, limb-sparing surgery may still be possible in some cases. If the surgeon is not able to remove all of the tumor and enough healthy tissue around it, an amputation may be done. - Amputation: Surgery to remove part or all of an arm or leg. This may be done when it is not possible to remove all of the tumor in limb-sparing surgery. The patient may be fitted with a prosthesis (artificial limb) after amputation. - Rotationplasty: Surgery to remove the tumor and the knee joint. The part of the leg that remains below the knee is then attached to the part of the leg that remains above the knee, with the foot facing backward and the ankle acting as a knee. A prosthesis may then be attached to the foot. Studies have shown that survival is the same whether the first surgery done is a limb-sparing surgery or an amputation. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients are also given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left in the area where the tumor was removed or that have spread to other parts of the body. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. In the treatment of osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytosis of bone, chemotherapy is usually given before and after surgery to remove the primary tumor. See Drugs Approved for Bone Cancer for more information. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Osteosarcoma and MFH cells are not killed easily by external radiation therapy. It may be used when a small amount of cancer is left after surgery or used together with other treatments. Samarium Samarium is a radioactive drug that targets areas where bone cells are growing, such as tumor cells in bone. It helps relieve pain caused by cancer in the bone and it also kills blood cells in the bone marrow. It also is used to treat osteosarcoma that has come back after treatment in a different bone. Treatment with samarium may be followed by stem cell transplant. Before treatment with samarium, stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After treatment with samarium is complete, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to find and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Kinase inhibitor therapy and monoclonal antibody therapy are types of targeted therapy being studied in clinical trials for osteosarcoma. Kinase inhibitor therapy blocks a protein needed for cancer cells to divide. Sorafenib is a type of kinase inhibitor therapy being studied for the treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Denosumab, dinutuximab, and glembatumumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied for the treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Treatment Options for Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone Localized Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone Treatment may include the following: - Surgery. Combination chemotherapy is usually given before and after surgery. - Surgery followed by radiation therapy when the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery.

Metastatic Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone Lung Metastasis When osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) spreads, it usually spreads to the lung. Treatment of osteosarcoma and MFH with lung metastasis may include the following: - Combination chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the primary cancer and the cancer that has spread to the lung. Bone Metastasis or Bone with Lung Metastasis Osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma may spread to a distant bone and/or the lung.

Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?","output":"Key Points - Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. - Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - There are different subtypes of AML. - Smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML. - Signs and symptoms of adult AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding. - Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult AML. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. It is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells: - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body. - White blood cells that fight infection and disease. - Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding. In AML, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts). The myeloblasts in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. Sometimes in AML, too many stem cells become abnormal red blood cells or platelets. These abnormal white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets are also called leukemia cells or blasts. Leukemia cells can build up in the bone marrow and blood so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums. This summary is about adult AML. See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia: - Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment - Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment There are different subtypes of AML. Most AML subtypes are based on how mature (developed) the cancer cells are at the time of diagnosis and how different they are from normal cells. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML that occurs when parts of two genes stick together. APL usually occurs in middle-aged adults. Signs of APL may include both bleeding and forming blood clots."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia? ?","output":"Smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Possible risk factors for AML include the following: - Being male. - Smoking, especially after age 60. - Having had treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past. - Having had treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the past. - Being exposed to radiation from an atomic bomb or to the chemical benzene. - Having a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?","output":"Signs and symptoms of adult AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding. The early signs and symptoms of AML may be like those caused by the flu or other common diseases. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: - Fever. - Shortness of breath. - Easy bruising or bleeding. - Petechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding). - Weakness or feeling tired. - Weight loss or loss of appetite."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?","output":"Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult AML. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. - Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells. - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. - Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Other tests, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. - Immunophenotyping : A process used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. This process is used to diagnose the subtype of AML by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system. For example, a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals (dyes) to look for certain changes in the sample. A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell. - Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test (RTPCR): A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes. This test is used to diagnose certain types of AML including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on: - The age of the patient. - The subtype of AML. - Whether the patient received chemotherapy in the past to treat a different cancer. - Whether there is a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome. - Whether the cancer has spread to the central nervous system. - Whether the cancer has been treated before or recurred (come back). It is important that acute leukemia be treated right away."},{"instruction":"What are the stages of Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?","output":"Key Points - Once adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. - There is no standard staging system for adult AML. Once adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. In adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the subtype of AML and whether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow are used instead of the stage to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread: - Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap. - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. There is no standard staging system for adult AML. The disease is described as untreated, in remission, or recurrent. Untreated adult AML In untreated adult AML, the disease is newly diagnosed. It has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever, bleeding, or pain, and the following are true: - The complete blood count is abnormal. - At least 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells). - There are signs or symptoms of leukemia. Adult AML in remission In adult AML in remission, the disease has been treated and the following are true: - The complete blood count is normal. - Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells). - There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain and spinal cord or elsewhere in the body. Recurrent Adult AML Recurrent AML is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The AML may come back in the blood or bone marrow."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia. - The treatment of adult AML usually has 2 phases. - Four types of standard treatment are used: - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Stem cell transplant - Other drug therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Targeted therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia. Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. The treatment of adult AML usually has 2 phases. The 2 treatment phases of adult AML are: - Remission induction therapy: This is the first phase of treatment. The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission. - Post-remission therapy: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins after the leukemia is in remission. The goal of post-remission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse. This phase is also called remission continuation therapy. Four types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult AML that has spread to the brain and spinal cord. Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the subtype of AML being treated and whether leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated and whether leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult AML. Stem cell transplant Stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Other drug therapy Arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells. These drugs are used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia. See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of adult AML. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. Oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are two different diseases, but they have some risk factors in common. The following are risk factors for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: Tobacco use Using tobacco is the most common cause of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. The risk of these cancers is about 5 to 10 times higher for current smokers than for people who have never smoked. The use of all types of tobacco, including cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) can cause cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx. For cigarette smokers, the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Alcohol use Using alcohol is also an important risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about twice as high in people who have 3 to 4 alcoholic drinks per day and 5 times higher in people who have 5 or more alcoholic drinks per day compared with those who don't drink alcohol. Tobacco and alcohol use The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is 2 to 3 times higher in people who use both tobacco and alcohol than it is in people who use only tobacco or only alcohol. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about 35 times higher in people who smoke 2 or more packs of cigarettes per day and have more than 4 alcoholic drinks per day than it is in people who have never smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol. Betel quid or gutka chewing Chewing betel quid or gutka (betel quid mixed with tobacco) has been shown to increase the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. Betel quid contains areca nut, which is a cancer-causing substance. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with how long and how often betel quid or gutka are chewed. The risk for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is higher when chewing gutka than when chewing betel quid alone. Betel quid and gutka chewing is common in many countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia, including China and India. Personal history of head and neck cancer A personal history of head and neck cancer increases the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. The following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer: HPV infection Being infected with certain types of HPV, especially HPV type 16, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancer. HPV infection is spread mainly through sexual contact. The risk of oropharyngeal cancer is about 15 times higher in people who have oral HPV 16 infection compared with people who do not have oral HPV 16 infection. The following is a protective factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: Quitting smoking Studies have shown that when people stop smoking cigarettes, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer decreases by one half (50%) within 5 years. Within 20 years of quitting, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is the same as for a person who never smoked cigarettes. It is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer. It has not been proven that stopping alcohol use will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer. Getting an HPV vaccination greatly lessens the risk of oral HPV infection. It is not yet known whether getting an HPV vaccination at any age will decrease the risk of oropharyngeal cancer from HPV infection. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.

Childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the brain. Astrocytomas are tumors that start in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. An astrocyte is a type of glial cell. Glial cells hold nerve cells in place, bring food and oxygen to them, and help protect them from disease, such as infection. Gliomas are tumors that form from glial cells. An astrocytoma is a type of glioma. Astrocytoma is the most common type of glioma diagnosed in children. It can form anywhere in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). This summary is about the treatment of tumors that begin in astrocytes in the brain (primary brain tumors). Metastatic brain tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain. Treatment of metastatic brain tumors is not discussed here. Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults. However, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. See the following PDQ summaries for more information about other types of brain tumors in children and adults: - Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment Astrocytomas may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues. Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue. When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and almost all need treatment. The central nervous system controls many important body functions. Astrocytomas are most common in these parts of the central nervous system (CNS): - Cerebrum : The largest part of the brain, at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, speech, emotions, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. - Cerebellum : The lower, back part of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). The cerebellum controls movement, balance, and posture. - Brain stem : The part that connects the brain to the spinal cord, in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). The brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used in seeing, hearing, walking, talking, and eating. - Hypothalamus : The area in the middle of the base of the brain. It controls body temperature, hunger, and thirst. - Visual pathway: The group of nerves that connect the eye with the brain. - Spinal cord: The column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. The spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch."},{"instruction":"What causes Childhood Astrocytomas ?","output":"The cause of most childhood brain tumors is not known."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Childhood Astrocytomas? ?","output":"Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Possible risk factors for astrocytoma include: - Past radiation therapy to the brain. - Having certain genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or tuberous sclerosis."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Childhood Astrocytomas ?","output":"The signs and symptoms of astrocytomas are not the same in every child. Signs and symptoms depend on the following: - Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord. - The size of the tumor. - How fast the tumor grows. - The child's age and development. Some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood astrocytomas or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting. - Nausea and vomiting. - Vision, hearing, and speech problems. - Loss of balance and trouble walking. - Worsening handwriting or slow speech. - Weakness or change in feeling on one side of the body. - Unusual sleepiness. - More or less energy than usual. - Change in personality or behavior. - Seizures. - Weight loss or weight gain for no known reason. - Increase in the size of the head (in infants)."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Childhood Astrocytomas ?","output":"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood astrocytomas. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health. This includes checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. - Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). The eyes are tested one at a time. The eye not being tested is covered. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the same MRI scan to look at the chemical makeup of the brain tissue. Childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery. If doctors think there may be an astrocytoma, a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue. For tumors in the brain, a part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove tissue. Sometimes, the needle is guided by a computer. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. Because it can be hard to tell the difference between types of brain tumors, you may want to have your child's tissue sample checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing brain tumors. The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed: - Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. An MIB-1 test is a type of immunohistochemistry that checks tumor tissue for an antigen called MIB-1. This may show how fast a tumor is growing. Sometimes tumors form in a place that makes them hard to remove. If removing the tumor may cause severe physical, emotional, or learning problems, a biopsy is done and more treatment is given after the biopsy. Children who have NF1 may form a low-grade astrocytoma in the area of the brain that controls vision and may not need a biopsy. If the tumor does not continue to grow or symptoms do not occur, surgery to remove the tumor may not be needed."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Childhood Astrocytomas ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: - Whether the tumor is a low-grade or high-grade astrocytoma. - Where the tumor has formed in the CNS and if it has spread to nearby tissue or to other parts of the body. - How fast the tumor is growing. - The child's age. - Whether cancer cells remain after surgery. - Whether there are changes in certain genes. - Whether the child has NF1 or tuberous sclerosis. - Whether the child has diencephalic syndrome (a condition which slows physical growth). - Whether the child has intracranial hypertension (cerebrospinal fluid pressure within the skull is high) at the time of diagnosis. - Whether the astrocytoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). For recurrent astrocytoma, prognosis and treatment depend on how much time passed between the time treatment ended and the time the astrocytoma recurred."},{"instruction":"What are the stages of Childhood Astrocytomas ?","output":"Key Points - The grade of the tumor is used to plan cancer treatment. - Low-grade astrocytomas - High-grade astrocytomas - An MRI is done after surgery. The grade of the tumor is used to plan cancer treatment. Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. There is no standard staging system for childhood astrocytoma. Treatment is based on the following: - Whether the tumor is low grade or high grade. - Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent (has come back after treatment). The grade of the tumor describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread. The following grades are used: Low-grade astrocytomas Low-grade astrocytomas are slow-growing and rarely spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body. There are many types of low-grade astrocytomas. Low-grade astrocytomas can be either: - Grade I tumors pilocytic astrocytoma, subependymal giant cell tumor, or angiocentric glioma. - Grade II tumors diffuse astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, or choroid glioma of the third ventricle. Children who have neurofibromatosis type 1 may have more than one low-grade tumor in the brain. Children who have tuberous sclerosis have an increased risk of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. High-grade astrocytomas High-grade astrocytomas are fast-growing and often spread within the brain and spinal cord. There are several types of high-grade astrocytomas. High grade astrocytomas can be either: - Grade III tumors anaplastic astrocytoma or anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. - Grade IV tumors glioblastoma or diffuse midline glioma. Childhood astrocytomas usually do not spread to other parts of the body. An MRI is done after surgery. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is done in the first few days after surgery. This is to find out how much tumor, if any, remains after surgery and to plan further treatment."},{"instruction":"what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Astrocytomas ?","output":"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Other drug therapy Lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor. It prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Childhood Astrocytomas ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood astrocytoma. - Children with astrocytomas should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors. - Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years. - Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. - Six types of treatment are used: - Surgery - Observation - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Other drug therapy - If fluid builds up around the brain and spinal cord, a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure may be done. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood astrocytoma. Different types of treatment are available for children with astrocytomas. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Children with astrocytomas should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists: - Pediatrician. - Pediatric neurosurgeon. - Neurologist. - Neuropathologist. - Neuroradiologist. - Rehabilitation specialist. - Radiation oncologist. - Endocrinologist. - Psychologist. Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years. Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis. These signs or symptoms may continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment. Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following: - Physical problems. - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. - Second cancers (new types of cancer). Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.) Six types of treatment are used: Surgery Surgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood astrocytoma, as discussed in the General Information section of this summary. If cancer cells remain after surgery, further treatment depends on: - Where the remaining cancer cells are. - The grade of the tumor. - The age of the child. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Observation may be used: - If the patient has no symptoms, such as patients with neurofibromatosis type1. - If the tumor is small and is found when a different health problem is being diagnosed or treated. - After the tumor is removed by surgery until signs or symptoms appear or change. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following: - Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. - Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. - Stereotactic radiation therapy: Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims radiation directly at the tumor. The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy. - Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons (tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood astrocytomas. Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development, especially in young children. For children younger than 3 years, chemotherapy may be given instead, to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. Systemic combination chemotherapy is used in the treatment of children with astrocytoma. High-dose chemotherapy may be used in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytoma. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. For high-grade astrocytoma that has come back after treatment, high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is used if there is only a small amount of tumor. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. There are different types of targeted therapy: - Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell, to stop cancer cells. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion into a vein. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. There are different types of monoclonal antibody therapy: - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapy: Cancer cells make a substance called VEGF, which causes new blood vessels to form (angiogenesis) and helps the cancer grow. VEGF inhibitors block VEGF and stop new blood vessels from forming. This may kill cancer cells because they need new blood vessels to grow. Bevacizumab is a VEGF inhibitor and angiogenesis inhibitor being used to treat childhood astrocytoma. - Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When PD-1 attaches to another protein called PDL-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 inhibitors attach to PDL-1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. PD-1 inhibitors are being studied to treat high-grade astrocytoma that has recurred. - Protein kinase inhibitors work in different ways. There are several kinds of protein kinase inhibitors. - mTOR inhibitors stop cells from dividing and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Everolimus and sirolimus are mTOR inhibitors used to treat childhood subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. mTOR inhibitors also are being studied to treat low-grade astrocytoma that has recurred. - BRAF inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is being studied to treat low-grade astrocytoma that has recurred. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been used to treat high-grade astrocytomas that have recurred but more study is needed to know how well they work in children. - MEK inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells. MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib are being studied to treat low-grade astrocytoma that has recurred. See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Other drug therapy Lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor. It prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow. If fluid builds up around the brain and spinal cord, a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure may be done. Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up around the brain and spinal cord. A shunt (long, thin tube) is placed in a ventricle (fluid-filled space) of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. (See the General Information section for a list of tests.) Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Regular MRIs will continue to be done after treatment has ended. The results of the MRI can show if your child's condition has changed or if the astrocytoma has recurred (come back). If the results of the MRI show a mass in the brain, a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing. Treatment Options for Childhood Astrocytomas Newly Diagnosed Childhood Low-Grade Astrocytomas When the tumor is first diagnosed, treatment for childhood low-grade astrocytoma depends on where the tumor is, and is usually surgery. An MRI is done after surgery to see if there is tumor remaining. If the tumor was completely removed by surgery, more treatment may not be needed and the child is closely watched to see if signs or symptoms appear or change. This is called observation. If there is tumor remaining after surgery, treatment may include the following: - Observation. - A second surgery to remove the tumor. - Radiation therapy, which may include conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton beam radiation therapy, or stereotactic radiation therapy, when the tumor begins to grow again. - Combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. In some cases, observation is used for children who have a visual pathway glioma. In other cases, treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. A goal of treatment is to save as much vision as possible. The effect of tumor growth on the child's vision will be closely followed during treatment. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) may not need treatment unless the tumor grows or signs or symptoms, such as vision problems, appear. When the tumor grows or signs or symptoms appear, treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Children with tuberous sclerosis may develop benign (not cancer) tumors in the brain called subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Targeted therapy with everolimus or sirolimus may be used instead of surgery, to shrink the tumors.

Talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Recurrent Childhood Low-Grade Astrocytomas When low-grade astrocytoma recurs after treatment, it usually comes back where the tumor first formed. Before more cancer treatment is given, imaging tests, biopsy, or surgery are done to find out if there is cancer and how much there is. Treatment of recurrent childhood low-grade astrocytoma may include the following: - A second surgery to remove the tumor, if surgery was the only treatment given when the tumor was first diagnosed. - Radiation therapy to the tumor only, if radiation therapy was not used when the tumor was first diagnosed. Conformal radiation therapy may be given. - Chemotherapy, if the tumor recurred where it cannot be removed by surgery or the patient had radiation therapy when the tumor was first diagnosed. - Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) with or without chemotherapy. - A clinical trial of targeted therapy with a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib), an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus), or a MEK inhibitor (selumetinib). - A clinical trial of lenalidomide.

Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The prostate gland makes fluid that is part of the semen. Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the U.S., about 1 out of 5 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Prostate Cancer ?","output":"Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine or frequent urination. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by prostate cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: - Weak or interrupted (\\"stop-and-go\\") flow of urine. - Sudden urge to urinate. - Frequent urination (especially at night). - Trouble starting the flow of urine. - Trouble emptying the bladder completely. - Pain or burning while urinating. - Blood in the urine or semen. - A pain in the back, hips, or pelvis that doesn't go away. - Shortness of breath, feeling very tired, fast heartbeat, dizziness, or pale skin caused by anemia. Other conditions may cause the same symptoms. As men age, the prostate may get bigger and block the urethra or bladder. This may cause trouble urinating or sexual problems. The condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and although it is not cancer, surgery may be needed. The symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia or of other problems in the prostate may be like symptoms of prostate cancer."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Prostate Cancer ?","output":"Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: - Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Digital rectal exam (DRE): An exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or abnormal areas. - Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test : A test that measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. PSA levels may also be high in men who have an infection or inflammation of the prostate or BPH (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate). - Transrectal ultrasound : A procedure in which a probe that is about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate. The probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Transrectal ultrasound may be used during a biopsy procedure. - Transrectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): A procedure that uses a strong magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A probe that gives off radio waves is inserted into the rectum near the prostate. This helps the MRI machine make clearer pictures of the prostate and nearby tissue. A transrectal MRI is done to find out if the cancer has spread outside the prostate into nearby tissues. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). - Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. The pathologist will check the tissue sample to see if there are cancer cells and find out the Gleason score. The Gleason score ranges from 2-10 and describes how likely it is that a tumor will spread. The lower the number, the less likely the tumor is to spread. A transrectal biopsy is used to diagnose prostate cancer. A transrectal biopsy is the removal of tissue from the prostate by inserting a thin needle through the rectum and into the prostate. This procedure is usually done using transrectal ultrasound to help guide where samples of tissue are taken from. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Prostate Cancer ?","output":"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose prostate cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.) In prostate cancer, staging tests may not be done unless the patient has symptoms or signs that the cancer has spread, such as bone pain, a high PSA level, or a high Gleason score. The following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process: - Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). - CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - Pelvic lymphadenectomy : A surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the pelvis. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. - Seminal vesicle biopsy : The removal of fluid from the seminal vesicles (glands that make semen) using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells. - ProstaScint scan : A procedure to check for cancer that has spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material attaches to prostate cancer cells and is detected by a scanner. The radioactive material shows up as a bright spot on the picture in areas where there are a lot of prostate cancer cells. The stage of the cancer is based on the results of the staging and diagnostic tests, including the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and the Gleason score. The tissue samples removed during the biopsy are used to find out the Gleason score. The Gleason score ranges from 2-10 and describes how different the cancer cells look from normal cells and how likely it is that the tumor will spread. The lower the number, the less likely the tumor is to spread. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if prostate cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually prostate cancer cells. The disease is metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody, may be used to prevent bone metastases. The following stages are used for prostate cancer: Stage I In stage I, cancer is found in the prostate only. The cancer: - is found by needle biopsy (done for a high PSA level) or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia). The PSA level is lower than 10 and the Gleason score is 6 or lower; or - is found in one-half or less of one lobe of the prostate. The PSA level is lower than 10 and the Gleason score is 6 or lower; or - cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests. Cancer is found in one-half or less of one lobe of the prostate. The PSA level and the Gleason score are not known. Stage II In stage II, cancer is more advanced than in stage I, but has not spread outside the prostate. Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB. In stage IIA, cancer: - is found by needle biopsy (done for a high PSA level) or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia). The PSA level is lower than 20 and the Gleason score is 7; or - is found by needle biopsy (done for a high PSA level) or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia). The PSA level is at least 10 but lower than 20 and the Gleason score is 6 or lower; or - is found in one-half or less of one lobe of the prostate. The PSA level is at least 10 but lower than 20 and the Gleason score is 6 or lower; or - is found in one-half or less of one lobe of the prostate. The PSA level is lower than 20 and the Gleason score is 7; or - is found in more than one-half of one lobe of the prostate. In stage IIB, cancer: - is found in opposite sides of the prostate. The PSA can be any level and the Gleason score can range from 2 to 10; or - cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests. The PSA level is 20 or higher and the Gleason score can range from 2 to 10; or - cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests. The PSA can be any level and the Gleason score is 8 or higher. Stage III In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the outer layer of the prostate and may have spread to the seminal vesicles. The PSA can be any level and the Gleason score can range from 2 to 10. Stage IV In stage IV, the PSA can be any level and the Gleason score can range from 2 to 10. Also, cancer: - has spread beyond the seminal vesicles to nearby tissue or organs, such as the rectum, bladder, or pelvic wall; or - may have spread to the seminal vesicles or to nearby tissue or organs, such as the rectum, bladder, or pelvic wall. Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes; or - has spread to distant parts of the body, which may include lymph nodes or bones. Prostate cancer often spreads to the bones."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Prostate Cancer ?","output":"Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. - Seven types of standard treatment are used: - Watchful waiting or active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy - Hormone therapy - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - Bisphosphonate therapy - There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Cryosurgery - High-intensityfocused ultrasound therapy - Proton beam radiation therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Different types of treatment are available for patients with prostate cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Seven types of standard treatment are used: Watchful waiting or active surveillance Watchful waiting and active surveillance are treatments used for older men who do not have signs or symptoms or have other medical conditions and for men whose prostate cancer is found during a screening test. Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Treatment is given to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Active surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including digital rectal exam, PSA test, transrectal ultrasound, and transrectal needle biopsy, to check if the cancer is growing. When the cancer begins to grow, treatment is given to cure the cancer. Other terms that are used to describe not giving treatment to cure prostate cancer right after diagnosis are observation, watch and wait, and expectant management. Surgery Patients in good health whose tumor is in the prostate gland only may be treated with surgery to remove the tumor. The following types of surgery are used: - Radical prostatectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate, surrounding tissue, and seminal vesicles. There are two types of radical prostatectomy: - Retropubic prostatectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate through an incision (cut) in the abdominal wall. Removal of nearby lymph nodes may be done at the same time. - Perineal prostatectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate through an incision (cut) made in the perineum (area between the scrotum and anus). Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed through a separate incision in the abdomen. - Pelvic lymphadenectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the pelvis. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If the lymph nodes contain cancer, the doctor will not remove the prostate and may recommend other treatment. - Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): A surgical procedure to remove tissue from the prostate using a resectoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a cutting tool) inserted through the urethra. This procedure is done to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy and it is sometimes done to relieve symptoms caused by a tumor before other cancer treatment is given. TURP may also be done in men whose tumor is in the prostate only and who cannot have a radical prostatectomy. In some cases, nerve-sparing surgery can be done. This type of surgery may save the nerves that control erection. However, men with large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves may not be able to have this surgery. Possible problems after prostate cancer surgery include the following: - Impotence. - Leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum. - Shortening of the penis (1 to 2 centimeters). The exact reason for this is not known. - Inguinal hernia (bulging of fat or part of the small intestine through weak muscles into the groin). Inguinal hernia may occur more often in men treated with radical prostatectomy than in men who have some other types of prostate surgery, radiation therapy, or prostate biopsy alone. It is most likely to occur within the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy. Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are different types of radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Conformal radiation is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue. Hypofractionated radiation therapy may be given because it has a more convenient treatment schedule. Hypofractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which a larger than usual total dose of radiation is given once a day over a shorter period of time (fewer days) compared to standard radiation therapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy may have worse side effects than standard radiation therapy, depending on the schedules used. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. In early-stage prostate cancer, the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate using needles that are inserted through the skin between the scrotum and rectum. The placement of the radioactive seeds in the prostate is guided by images from transrectal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT). The needles are removed after the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate. - Radiopharmaceutical therapy uses a radioactive substance to treat cancer. Radiopharmaceutical therapy includes the following: - Alpha emitter radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance to treat prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. A radioactive substance called radium-223 is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radium-223 collects in areas of bone with cancer and kills the cancer cells. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy, and radiopharmaceutical therapy are used to treat prostate cancer. Men treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased risk of having bladder and/or gastrointestinal cancer. Radiation therapy can cause impotence and urinary problems. Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. In prostate cancer, male sex hormones can cause prostate cancer to grow. Drugs, surgery, or other hormones are used to reduce the amount of male hormones or block them from working. Hormone therapy for prostate cancer may include the following: - Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists can stop the testicles from making testosterone. Examples are leuprolide, goserelin, and buserelin. - Antiandrogens can block the action of androgens (hormones that promote male sex characteristics), such as testosterone. Examples are flutamide, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and nilutamide. - Drugs that can prevent the adrenal glands from making androgens include ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide. - Orchiectomy is a surgical procedure to remove one or both testicles, the main source of male hormones, such as testosterone, to decrease the amount of hormone being made. - Estrogens (hormones that promote female sex characteristics) can prevent the testicles from making testosterone. However, estrogens are seldom used today in the treatment of prostate cancer because of the risk of serious side effects. Hot flashes, impaired sexual function, loss of desire for sex, and weakened bones may occur in men treated with hormone therapy. Other side effects include diarrhea, nausea, and itching. See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information. Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. Sipuleucel-T is a type of biologic therapy used to treat prostate cancer that has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body). See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information. Bisphosphonate therapy Bisphosphonate drugs, such as clodronate or zoledronate, reduce bone disease when cancer has spread to the bone. Men who are treated with antiandrogen therapy or orchiectomy are at an increased risk of bone loss. In these men, bisphosphonate drugs lessen the risk of bone fracture (breaks). The use of bisphosphonate drugs to prevent or slow the growth of bone metastases is being studied in clinical trials. There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy. Prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and certain types of hormone therapy can weaken bones and lead to bone pain. Treatments for bone pain include the following: - Pain medicine. - External radiation therapy. - Strontium-89 (a radioisotope). - Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody, such as denosumab. - Bisphosphonate therapy. - Corticosteroids. See the PDQ summary on Pain for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Cryosurgery Cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy prostate cancer cells. Ultrasound is used to find the area that will be treated. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. Cryosurgery can cause impotence and leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum. High-intensityfocused ultrasound therapy High-intensityfocused ultrasound therapy is a treatment that uses ultrasound (high-energy sound waves) to destroy cancer cells. To treat prostate cancer, an endorectal probe is used to make the sound waves. Proton beam radiation therapy Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that targets tumors with streams of protons (small, positively charged particles). This type of radiation therapy is being studied in the treatment of prostate cancer. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Treatment Options by Stage Stage I Prostate Cancer Standard treatment of stage I prostate cancer may include the following: - Watchful waiting. - Active surveillance. If the cancer begins to grow, hormone therapy may be given. - Radical prostatectomy, usually with pelvic lymphadenectomy. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery. - External radiation therapy.

Most consist of three components: - the femoral component, which is the part that attaches to the thigh bone - the tibial component, the part that attaches to the shin bone - the patellar component, the knee cap. the femoral component, which is the part that attaches to the thigh bone the tibial component, the part that attaches to the shin bone the patellar component, the knee cap. Total and Partial Knee Replacement Knee replacement may be either total or partial/unicompartmental. In total knee replacement, as the name suggests, the entire knee joint is replaced. You will likely need a total knee replacement if you have damage to several parts of your knee. In partial/unicompartmental knee replacement, the surgeon replaces just the damaged part of the knee. You may be able to have a partial knee replacement if only one section of your knee is damaged. However, when one part is replaced, there is a chance that another part will develop arthritis, requiring further surgery. Cemented and Uncemented Joint Components Joint components may also be attached to your own bone in different ways. Most are cemented with a special joint glue into your existing bone; others rely on a process called biologic fixation to hold them in place. This means that the parts are made with a porous surface, and over time your own bone grows into the joint surface to secure them. In some cases, surgeons use a combination of cemented and uncemented parts. This is referred to as a hybrid implant. Minimally Invasive Surgery While some knee replacement surgery requires an 8- to 12-inch incision in the front of the knee, surgeons at many medical centers are now performing what is called minimally invasive surgery using incisions of 3 to 5 inches or even smaller. Because the incision is smaller, there may be less pain and a shorter recovery time. If you think you might be interested in minimally invasive surgery, speak with your surgeon."},{"instruction":"What are the complications of Knee Replacement ?","output":"While new technology and advances in surgical techniques have greatly reduced the risks involved with knee replacements, there are still some risks you should be aware of. Two of the most common possible problems are blood clots and infection. Preventing Blood Clots Blood clots can occur in the veins of your legs after knee replacement surgery. To reduce the risk of clots, your doctor may have you elevate your leg periodically and prescribe special exercises, support hose, or blood thinners. Preventing Infections Infection can occur when bacteria enter the bloodstream from skin or urinary tract infections. To reduce the risk of infection, your doctors may prescribe antibiotics for you to take prior to your surgery and for a short time afterward. Other Complications Other complications, such as new or ongoing pain, stiffness, fracture, bleeding, or injury to the blood vessels can occur. Serious medical complications, such as heart attack or stroke, are very rare. Warning Signs To Watch For To minimize the risk of complications, it is important to recognize signs of potential problems early and contact your doctor. For example, tenderness, redness, and swelling of your calf or swelling of your thigh, ankle, calf, or foot could be warning signs of a possible blood clot. Warning signs of infection include fever or chills, tenderness and swelling of the wound, and drainage from the wound. You should call your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. It is important to get instructions from your doctor before leaving the hospital and follow them carefully once you get home. Doing so will give you the greatest chance of a successful surgery."},{"instruction":"What is the outlook for Knee Replacement ?","output":"Recovery from knee replacement extends long after you leave the hospital. Preparing for recovery requires learning what to expect in the days and weeks following surgery. It requires understanding what you will and wont be able to do and when. It also means arranging for social support and arranging your house to make everyday tasks easier and to help speed your recovery. Find Someone To Stay with You Because you will not be able to drive for several weeks after surgery, you will need someone to take you home from the hospital and be on hand to run errands or take you to appointments until you can drive yourself. If you live with someone, you should have them plan to stay home with you or at least stay close by, in case you need help. If you dont live with a family member or have one close by, a friend or neighbor may be able to help. Other options include staying in an extended-care facility during your recovery or hiring someone to come to your home and help you. Your hospital social worker should be able to help you make arrangements. Prepare Your Home for Your Recovery To prepare your home for your recovery, stock up on needed items before you leave for the hospital. Make sure you have plenty of non-perishable foods on hand. Prepare meals and freeze them to put in the microwave when you need an easy meal. In the first weeks after surgery, you should avoid going up and down stairs. If your bedroom is on the second floor of your home, consider moving to a downstairs bedroom temporarily or sleeping on the sofa. Set Up a Recovery Station Set up a recovery station at home. Place a sturdy chair where you plan to spend most of your time sitting during the first weeks after surgery. The chair should be 18 to 20 inches high and should have two arms and a firm seat and back. Place a foot stool in front of the chair so you can elevate your legs, and place items you will need such as the television remote control, telephone, medicine, and tissues where you can reach them easily from the chair. Place items you use every day at arms level to avoid reaching up or bending down. Ask your doctor or physical therapist about devices and tips that may make daily activities easier once you get home. Devices you may find helpful include long-handled reachers to retrieve items placed on high shelves or dropped on the floor, aprons with pockets that allow you to carry items while leaving your hands free for crutches, shower benches that let you sit while you shower, and dressing sticks to help you get dressed without bending your new knee excessively. Safeguard Against Falls Because a fall can damage your new knee, making your home a safe place is crucial. Before your surgery, look for and correct hazards, including cluttered floors, loose electrical cords, unsecured rugs, and dark hallways. Bathrooms are likely places to fall, so particular attention is needed there. A raised toilet seat can make it easier to get up and down. Grab bars in the tub can keep you steady. Textured shapes on the shower floor can minimize slipping. Gradually Increase Activity It is also important to exercise to get stronger while avoiding any activities that can damage or dislocate your new joint. Activity should include a graduated walking program (where you slowly increase the time, distance, and pace that you walk) and specific exercises several times a day to prevent scarring, restore movement, and stabilize and strengthen your new knee. Remember Follow-ups Your surgeon will let you know about follow-up visits. Even after you have healed from surgery, you will need to see your surgeon periodically for examinations and x-rays to detect any potential problems with your knee. By preparing for surgery and recovery and following your doctor's advice, you can get the greatest benefits from your new knee with the least risk of complications for many years to come."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Knee Replacement ?","output":"The main reason to have knee replacement surgery is to ease pain and disability caused by arthritis or other joint problems, while preserving movement.

Attacks frequently occur at night and can be triggered by stressful events, alcohol or drugs, or the presence of another illness. Early attacks usually subside within 3 to 10 days, even without treatment, and the next attack may not occur for months or even years. Where Gout Usually Occurs Sometime during the course of the disease, many patients will develop gout in the big toe. Gout frequently affects joints in the lower part of the body such as the ankles, heels, knees, or toes. Who is at Risk? Adult men, particularly those between the ages of 40 and 50, are more likely to develop gout than women, who rarely develop the disease before menstruation ends. A Buildup of Uric Acid Before an attack, needle-like crystals of uric acid build up in connective tissue, in the joint space between two bones, or in both. Uric acid is a substance that results from the breakdown of purines, which are part of all human tissue and are found in many foods. Normally, uric acid is dissolved in the blood and passed through the kidneys into the urine, where it is eliminated. If there is an increase in the production of uric acid or if the kidneys do not eliminate enough uric acid from the body, levels of it build up in the blood (a condition called hyperuricemia). Hyperuricemia also may result when a person eats too many high-purine foods, such as liver, dried beans and peas, anchovies, and gravies. Hyperuricemia is not a disease, and by itself it is not dangerous. However, if too many uric acid crystals form as a result of hyperuricemia, gout can develop. The crystals form and build up in the joint, causing inflammation. Stages of Gout Gout can progress through four stages. Asymptomatic (without symptoms) hyperuricemia. In this stage, a person has elevated levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia), but no other symptoms. Treatment is usually not required. Acute gout, or acute gouty arthritis. In this stage, hyperuricemia has caused uric acid crystals to build up in joint spaces. This leads to a sudden onset of intense pain and swelling in the joints, which also may be warm and very tender. An acute (sudden) attack commonly occurs at night and can be triggered by stressful events, alcohol or drugs, or the presence of another illness. Attacks usually subside within 3 to 10 days, even without treatment, and the next attack may not occur for months or even years. Over time, however, attacks can last longer and occur more frequently. Interval or intercritical gout. This is the period between acute attacks. In this stage, a person does not have any symptoms. Chronic tophaceous (toe FAY shus) gout. This is the most disabling stage of gout. It usually develops over a long period, such as 10 years. In this stage, the disease may have caused permanent damage to the affected joints and sometimes to the kidneys. With proper treatment, most people with gout do not progress to this advanced stage."},{"instruction":"What causes Gout ?","output":"A Buildup of Uric Acid Most people with gout have too much uric acid in their blood, a condition called hyperuricemia.

In addition, having hyperuricemia alone does not mean that a person will get gout. In fact, most people with hyperuricemia do not develop the disease. Testing for Gout To confirm a diagnosis of gout, the doctor inserts a needle into the inflamed joint and draws a sample of synovial fluid, the substance that lubricates a joint.

The goals for treatment are to ease the pain that comes from sudden attacks, prevent future attacks, stop uric acid buildup in the tissues and joint space between two bones, and prevent kidney stones from forming. Common Treatments The most common treatments for an attack of gout are high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are taken by mouth, or corticosteroids, which are taken by mouth or injected into the affected joint. Patients often begin to improve within a few hours of treatment. The attack usually goes away completely within a week or so. Several NSAIDs are available over the counter. It is important to check with your doctor concerning the safety of using these drugs and to verify the proper dosage. When NSAIDs or corticosteroids fail to control pain and swelling, the doctor may use another drug, colchicine. This drug is most effective when taken within the first 12 hours of an acute attack. For patients who have repeated gout attacks, the doctor may prescribe medicine such as allupurinol, febuxostat, or probenecid to lower uric acid levels. In severe cases of gout that do not respond to other treatments, pegloticase, a medicine administered by intravenous infusion, may be prescribed to reduce levels of uric acid."},{"instruction":"what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Gout ?","output":"Because uric acids role in gout is well understood and medications to ease attacks and reduce the risk or severity of future attacks are widely available, gout is one of the mostif not the mostcontrollable forms of arthritis.

The lens is a clear part of the eye that helps to focus light, or an image, on the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In a normal eye, light passes through the transparent lens to the retina. Once it reaches the retina, light is changed into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. In a normal eye, light passes through the transparent lens to the retina. Once it reaches the retina, light is changed into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. A cataract can occur in either or both eyes. It cannot spread from one eye to the other. Cataracts and Aging Most cataracts are related to aging. Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Cataract? ?","output":"Age-related cataracts develop in two ways. - Clumps of protein reduce the sharpness of the image reaching the retina. - The clear lens slowly changes to a yellowish/brownish color, adding a brownish tint to vision. Clumps of protein reduce the sharpness of the image reaching the retina. The clear lens slowly changes to a yellowish/brownish color, adding a brownish tint to vision. Protein Clumpings Cloud the Lens The lens consists mostly of water and protein. When the protein clumps up, it clouds the lens and reduces the light that reaches the retina. The clouding may become severe enough to cause blurred vision. Most age-related cataracts develop from protein clumpings. When a cataract is small, the cloudiness affects only a small part of the lens. You may not notice any changes in your vision. Cataracts tend to grow slowly, so vision gets worse gradually. Over time, the cloudy area in the lens may get larger, and the cataract may increase in size. Seeing may become more difficult. Your vision may get duller or blurrier. Discoloration of the Lens Cataracts cause the lens to change to a yellowish/brownish color. As the clear lens slowly colors with age, your vision gradually may acquire a brownish shade. At first, the amount of tinting may be small and may not cause a vision problem. Over time, increased tinting may make it more difficult to read and perform other routine activities. This gradual change in the amount of tinting does not affect the sharpness of the image transmitted to the retina. If you have advanced lens discoloration, you may not be able to identify blues and purples. You may be wearing what you believe to be a pair of black socks, only to find out from friends that you are wearing purple socks. Risk Factors The risk of cataract increases as you get older.

Get Regular Eye Exams Be sure to have regular comprehensive eye exams. If you are age 60 or older, you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Eye exams can help detect cataracts and other age-related eye problems at their earliest stages. In addition to cataract, your eye care professional can check for signs of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other vision disorders. For many eye diseases, early treatment may save your sight. For more on comprehensive eye exams, see the chapter on Symptoms and Detection. Quit Smoking Ask your doctor for help to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Wear Sunglasses Ultraviolet light from the sun may contribute to the development of cataracts. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B (UVB) rays when you're outdoors. Take Care of Other Health Problems Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts. Maintain a Healthy Weight If your current weight is a healthy one, work to maintain it by exercising most days of the week. If you're overweight or obese, work to lose weight slowly by reducing your calorie intake and increasing the amount of exercise you get each day.

Surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Cataract ?","output":"A cataract needs to be removed only when vision loss interferes with your everyday activities, such as driving, reading, or watching TV. You and your eye care professional can make this decision together. Is Surgery Right For You? Once you understand the benefits and risks of surgery, you can make an informed decision about whether cataract surgery is right for you. In most cases, delaying cataract surgery will not cause long-term damage to your eye or make the surgery more difficult. You do not have to rush into surgery. Sometimes a cataract should be removed even if it does not cause problems with your vision. For example, a cataract should be removed if it prevents examination or treatment of another eye problem, such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. If you choose surgery, your eye care professional may refer you to a specialist to remove the cataract. If you have cataracts in both eyes that require surgery, the surgery will be performed on each eye at separate times, usually four to eight weeks apart. Cataract removal is one of the most common operations performed in the United States. It also is one of the safest and most effective types of surgery. In about 90 percent of cases, people who have cataract surgery have better vision afterward. Types of Cataract Surgery There are two types of cataract surgery, phacoemulsification and extracapsular surgery. Your doctor can explain the differences and help determine which is better for you. With phacoemulsification, or phaco, a small incision is made on the side of the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. Your doctor inserts a tiny probe into the eye. This device emits ultrasound waves that soften and break up the lens so that it can be removed by suction. Most cataract surgery today is done by phacoemulsification, also called small incision cataract surgery. With extracapsular surgery, your doctor makes a longer incision on the side of the cornea and removes the cloudy core of the lens in one piece. The rest of the lens is removed by suction. An Artificial Lens Replaces the Natural Lens After the natural lens has been removed, it usually is replaced by an artificial lens, called an intraocular lens, or IOL. An IOL is a clear, plastic lens that requires no care and becomes a permanent part of your eye. Light is focused clearly by the IOL onto the retina, improving your vision. You will not feel or see the new lens. The operation usually lasts less than one hour and is almost painless. Many people choose to stay awake during surgery. You can return quickly to many everyday activities, but your vision may be blurry. The healing eye needs time to adjust so that it can focus properly with the other eye, especially if the other eye has a cataract. Ask your doctor when you can resume driving. Wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataract. If you smoke, stop. Researchers also believe good nutrition can help reduce the risk of age-related cataract. They recommend eating green leafy vegetables, fruit, and other foods with antioxidants. If you are age 60 or older, you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year.

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that your liver makes. It is also found in some foods that come from animals. Cholesterol is found in all parts of your body. It plays a vital role in your body. It makes hormones, helps you digest food, and supports the workings of all the cells in your body. But your liver makes all the cholesterol that your body needs to do this. Lipoproteins and Cholesterol Cholesterol circulates in your blood stream. But it's fatty while your blood is watery. Just like oil and water, the two do not mix. As a result, cholesterol travels through your bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins. The packages are made of fat (lipids) on the inside and proteins on the outside. Two kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol through your bloodstream. It's important to have healthy levels of both: - low-density lipoproteins (LDL) - high-density lipoproteins (HDL). low-density lipoproteins (LDL) high-density lipoproteins (HDL). What Does LDL Cholesterol Do? Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) carry cholesterol to all the cells in your body, including the arteries that supply blood to your heart. LDL cholesterol is sometimes called bad cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of your arteries. The higher the level of LDL cholesterol in your blood, the greater your chances of getting heart disease. What Does HDL Cholesterol Do? High-density lipoproteins (HDL) carry cholesterol away from the cells in your body. HDL cholesterol is sometimes called good cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your artery walls. The liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. The higher your HDL cholesterol level, the lower your chances of getting heart disease. If Your Blood Cholesterol Is Too High Too much cholesterol in your blood is called high blood cholesterol. It can be serious. It increases your chances of having a heart attack or getting heart disease. When the cholesterol level in your blood is too high, it can build up in the walls of your arteries. This buildup of cholesterol is called plaque. Plaque Buildup Can Lead to - Artherosclerosis. Over time, the plaque can build up so much that it narrows your arteries. This is called atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. It can slow down or block the flow of blood to your heart. Artherosclerosis.

This blockage can cause a heart attack. Heart Attack. Some plaques have a thin covering, so they may rupture or break open. A blood clot can then form over the plaque. A clot can block the flow of blood through the artery. This blockage can cause a heart attack. Lowering Cholesterol Can Affect Plaque Lowering your cholesterol level reduces your chances of plaque rupturing and causing a heart attack. It may also slow down, reduce, or even stop plaque from building up. And it reduces your chances of dying from heart disease. High blood cholesterol itself does not cause symptoms, so many people don't know that they have it.

Normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy and functioning properly. Sometimes, however, the process goes wrong and cells become abnormal, forming more cells in an uncontrolled way. These extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. Tumors can be benign, which means not cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous. Lung cancer occurs when a tumor forms in the tissue of the lung. The Leading Cause of Cancer Death Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Experts estimate that over 200,000 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed each year slightly more cases in men than women. Over 150,000 Americans die of the disease each year. Lung cancer occurs most often between the ages of 55 and 65. (Watch the videos on this page to learn more about lung cancer.

Two Major Types of Lung Cancer There are two major types of lung cancer -- non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Each type of lung cancer grows and spreads in different ways, and each is treated differently. - Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer. - Small cell lung cancer grows more quickly and is more likely to spread to other organs in the body. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer grows more quickly and is more likely to spread to other organs in the body. Learn more about non-small cell lung cancer. Learn more about small cell lung cancer. Lung Cancer Can Spread Lung cancer may spread to the lymph nodes or other tissues in the chest, including the lung opposite to where it originated. It may also spread to other organs of the body, such as the bones, brain, or liver. When cancer spreads from its original location in the lung to another part of the body such as the brain, it is called metastatic lung cancer, not brain cancer. Doctors sometimes call this distant disease. Smoking and Lung Cancer Lung cancer would occur much less often if people did not smoke. The good news is that smoking is not as popular as it used to be. In 1965 about 42 percent of all adults smoked, but as of 2012, slightly less than 17 percent of people 18 and older smoked cigarettes. Also, since the 1990s there has been a steady drop in lung cancer deaths among men, mainly because fewer men are smoking, and since the turn of the century, lung cancer deaths in women have been slowly declining. Cigarette smoking rates had been dropping steadily in the 1990s and had started to level off at the start of the 21st century but the latest figures show a continued decline. The bad news is that other forms of tobacco use have shown some revival, but mainly in younger populations. The bad news is that smoking rates, which were dropping, have stopped declining in recent years. Smoking by young adults actually increased by 73 percent in the 1990s but has shown a downturn or leveling off in the past few years."},{"instruction":"What causes Lung Cancer ?","output":"Tobacco Products and Cancer Using tobacco products has been shown to cause cancer. In fact, smoking tobacco, using smokeless tobacco, and being exposed regularly to secondhand tobacco smoke are responsible for a large number of cancer deaths in the U.S. each year. Cigarette Smoking Causes Lung Cancer Cigarette smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. Scientists have reported widely on the link between cancer and smoking since the 1960s. Since then, study after study has provided more proof that cigarette smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer. Before cigarette smoking became popular after World War I, doctors rarely, if ever, saw patients with lung cancer. But today, lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer. Over 85 percent of people with lung cancer developed it because they smoked cigarettes. If You Smoke If you smoke cigarettes, you are at much higher risk for lung cancer than a person who has never smoked. The risk of dying from lung cancer is 23 times higher for men who smoke and 13 times higher for women who smoke than for people who have never smoked. Lung cancer can affect young and old alike. Stopping smoking greatly reduces your risk for developing lung cancer. After you stop, your risk levels off. Ten years after the last cigarette, the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by 50 percent -- which does not mean, however, that risk is eliminated. (Watch the videos on this page to learn more about lung cancer, smoking and older adults. To enlarge the videos, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner of the video screen. To reduce the videos, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Smoking cigars and pipes also puts you at risk for lung cancer. Cigar and pipe smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer than nonsmokers. Even cigar and pipe smokers who do not inhale are at increased risk for lung, mouth, and other types of cancer. The likelihood that a smoker will develop lung cancer is related to the age smoking began; how long the person smoked; the number of cigarettes, pipes, or cigars smoked per day; and how deeply the smoker inhaled. Learn about lung cancer prevention. Other Factors That Increase Your Risk - Many studies suggest that non-smokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, also called secondhand smoke, are at increased risk of lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that non-smokers are exposed to when they share air space with someone who is smoking. Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including hundreds that are toxic and about 70 that can cause cancer. Since 1964, approximately 2,500,000 nonsmokers have died from health problems caused by exposure to secondhand smoke. - Exposure to radon can put a person at risk for lung cancer, too. People who work in mines may be exposed to this invisible, odorless, and radioactive gas that occurs naturally in soil and rocks. It is also found in houses in some parts of the country. A kit available at most hardware stores allows homeowners to measure radon levels in their homes. - Another substance that can contribute to lung cancer is asbestos. Asbestos has been used in shipbuilding, asbestos mining and manufacturing, insulation work, and brake repair, although products with asbestos have been largely phased out over the past several decades. If inhaled, asbestos particles can lodge in the lungs, damaging cells and increasing the risk for lung cancer.

But if the cancer grows, it can cause changes that people should watch for. Common signs and symptoms of lung cancer include: - a cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over time - constant chest pain - coughing up blood - shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness - repeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitis - swelling of the neck and face - loss of appetite or weight loss - fatigue. a cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over time constant chest pain coughing up blood shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness repeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitis swelling of the neck and face loss of appetite or weight loss fatigue. These symptoms may be caused by lung cancer or by other conditions. It is important to check with a doctor if you have symptoms because only a doctor can make a diagnosis. Don't wait to feel pain. Early cancer usually doesn't cause pain. Tests for Lung Cancer To better understand a persons chance of developing lung cancer, a doctor first evaluates a person's medical history, smoking history, their exposure to environmental and occupational substances, and family history of cancer. The doctor also performs a physical exam and may order a test to take an image of the chest or other tests. Seeing a spot on an image is usually how a doctor first suspects that lung cancer may be present. If lung cancer is suspected, the doctor may order a test called sputum cytology. This is a simple test where, under a microscope, a doctor examines a sample of mucous cells coughed up from the lungs under a microscope to see if cancer is present. Biopsies to Detect Lung Cancer But to confirm the presence of lung cancer, the doctor must examine fluid or tissue from the lung. This is done through a biopsy -- the removal of a small sample of fluid or tissue for examination under a microscope by a pathologist. A biopsy can show whether a person has cancer. A number of procedures may be used to obtain this tissue. - Bronchoscopy -- The doctor puts a bronchoscope -- a thin, lighted tube -- into the mouth or nose and down through the windpipe to look into the breathing passages. Through this tube, the doctor can collect cells or small samples of tissue. - Needle Aspiration -- The doctor numbs the chest area and inserts a thin needle into the tumor to remove a sample of tissue. - Thoracentesis - Using a needle, the doctor removes a sample of the fluid that surrounds the lungs to check for cancer cells. - Thorascopy or Thoracotomy -- Surgery to open the chest is sometimes needed to diagnose lung cancer. This procedure is a major operation performed in a hospital.

Other Tests Doctors use imaging methods such as a spiral CT scan (also commonly known as helical CT) to look for signs of cancer. A CT scan, also known as computerized tomography scan, is a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. Other tests can include removal of lymph nodes for examination under a microscope to check for cancer cells. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures found throughout the body. They filter substances in a fluid called lymph and help fight infection and disease."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Lung Cancer ?","output":"There are many treatment options for lung cancer, mainly based on the extent of the disease. The choice of treatment depends on your age and general health, the stage of the cancer, whether or not it has spread beyond the lung, and other factors. If tests show that you have cancer, you should talk with your doctor and make treatment decisions as soon as possible. Studies show that early treatment leads to better outcomes. Working With a Team of Specialists A team of specialists often treats people with cancer. The team will keep the primary doctor informed about the patient's progress. The team may include a medical oncologist who is a specialist in cancer treatment, a surgeon, a radiation oncologist who is a specialist in radiation therapy, a thoracic surgeon who is a specialist in operating on organs in the chest, including the lungs, and others. Before starting treatment, you may want another doctor to review the diagnosis and treatment plan. Some insurance companies require a second opinion. Others may pay for a second opinion if you request it. Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer Some lung cancer patients take part in studies of new treatments. These studies, called clinical trials, are designed to find out whether a new treatment is safe and effective. Often, clinical trials compare a new treatment with a standard one so that doctors can learn which is more effective. People with lung cancer who are interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk with their doctor. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through its National Library of Medicine and other Institutes, maintains a database of clinical trials at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Doctors may suggest many different treatments or combinations of treatments to control the cancer and/or improve the patient's quality of life. What Standard Treatments Do Here are some of the most common treatments for lung cancer. - Surgery is an operation to remove the cancer. Depending on the location of the tumor, the surgeon may remove a small part of the lung, a lobe of the lung, or the entire lung and possibly even part of the ribcage to get to the lung. - Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body. Doctors use chemotherapy to control cancer growth and relieve symptoms. Anti-cancer drugs are given by injection; through a catheter, a long thin tube temporarily placed in a large vein; or in pill form. - Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. - Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. An external machine delivers radiation to a limited area, affecting cancer cells only in that area. Doctors may use radiation before surgery to shrink a tumor or after surgery to destroy any cancer cells remaining in the treated area. Surgery is an operation to remove the cancer.

Treating Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Doctors treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer in several ways, and surgery is a common treatment. Cryosurgery, a treatment that freezes and destroys cancer tissue, may be used to control symptoms in the later stages of non-small cell lung cancer. Doctors may also use radiation therapy and chemotherapy to slow the progress of the disease and to manage symptoms. See more information about treatments for non-small cell lung cancer. Treating Small Cell Lung Cancer Small cell lung cancer spreads quickly. In many cases, cancer cells have already spread to other parts of the body when the disease is diagnosed. In order to reach cancer cells throughout the body, doctors almost always use chemotherapy. Treatment for small cell lung cancer may also include radiation therapy aimed at the tumor in the lung or tumors in other parts of the body, such as in the brain. Surgery is part of the treatment plan for a small number of patients with small cell lung cancer. Some patients with small cell lung cancer have radiation therapy to the brain even though no cancer is found there. This treatment, called prophylactic cranial irradiation or PCI, is given to prevent tumors from forming in the brain. See more information about treatments for small cell lung cancer."},{"instruction":"what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Lung Cancer ?","output":"Researchers continue to look at new ways to combine, schedule, and sequence the use of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation to treat lung cancer.

Tests for AMD - The visual acuity test is an eye chart test that measures how well you see at various distances. - In the dilated eye exam, drops are placed in your eyes to widen, or dilate, the pupils. Then, your eye care professional uses a special magnifying lens to examine your retina and optic nerve for signs of AMD and other eye problems. After the exam, your close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. - With tonometry, an instrument measures the pressure inside the eye. Numbing drops may be applied to your eye for this test. The visual acuity test is an eye chart test that measures how well you see at various distances.

Your eye care professional also may do other tests to learn more about the structure and health of your eye. The Amsler Grid During an eye exam, you may be asked to look at an Amsler grid, shown here. You will cover one eye and stare at a black dot in the center of the grid. While staring at the dot, you may notice that the straight lines in the pattern appear wavy. You may notice that some of the lines are missing. These may be signs of AMD. Because dry AMD can turn into wet AMD at any time, you should get an Amsler grid from your eye care professional. You could then use the grid every day to evaluate your vision for signs of wet AMD. The Fluorescein Angiogram Test If your eye care professional believes you need treatment for wet AMD, he or she may suggest a fluorescein angiogram. In this test, a special dye is injected into your arm. Pictures are taken as the dye passes through the blood vessels in your eye. The test allows your eye care professional to identify any leaking blood vessels and recommend treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Agerelated Macular Degeneration ?","output":"If You Have Advanced AMD Once dry AMD reaches the advanced stage, no form of treatment can prevent vision loss. However, treatment can delay and possibly prevent intermediate AMD from progressing to the advanced stage. The National Eye Institute's Age-Related Eye Disease Study found that taking certain vitamins and minerals may reduce the risk of developing advanced AMD. Wet AMD can be treated with laser surgery, photodynamic therapy, and injections into the eye. None of these treatments is a cure for wet AMD. The disease and loss of vision may progress despite treatment. Laser Surgery Laser surgery uses a laser to destroy the fragile, leaky blood vessels. Only a small percentage of people with wet AMD can be treated with laser surgery. Laser surgery is performed in a doctor's office or eye clinic. The risk of new blood vessels developing after laser treatment is high. Repeated treatments may be necessary. In some cases, vision loss may progress despite repeated treatments. Photodynamic Therapy With photodynamic therapy, a drug called verteporfin is injected into your arm. It travels throughout the body, including the new blood vessels in your eye. The drug tends to stick to the surface of new blood vessels. Next, the doctor shines a light into your eye for about 90 seconds. The light activates the drug. The activated drug destroys the new blood vessels and leads to a slower rate of vision decline. Unlike laser surgery, verteporfin does not destroy surrounding healthy tissue. Because the drug is activated by light, you must avoid exposing your skin or eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light for five days after treatment. Photodynamic therapy is relatively painless. It takes about 20 minutes and can be performed in a doctor's office. Photodynamic therapy slows the rate of vision loss. It does not stop vision loss or restore vision in eyes already damaged by advanced AMD. Treatment results often are temporary. You may need to be treated again. Drug Treatment for Wet AMD Wet AMD can now be treated with new drugs that are injected into the eye (anti-VEGF therapy). Abnormally high levels of a specific growth factor occur in eyes with wet AMD and promote the growth of abnormal new blood vessels. This drug treatment blocks the effects of the growth factor. You will need multiple injections that may be given as often as monthly. The eye is numbed before each injection. After the injection, you will remain in the doctor's office for a while and your eye will be monitored. This drug treatment can help slow down vision loss from AMD and in some cases improve sight. If You Have Low Vision If you have lost some sight from AMD, ask your eye care professional about low vision services and devices that may help you make the most of your remaining vision. Many community organizations and agencies offer information about low vision counseling and training and other special services for people with visual impairments. Research on AMD The National Eye Institute is conducting and supporting a number of studies to learn more about AMD. For example, scientists are - studying the possibility of transplanting healthy cells into a diseased retina - evaluating families with a history of AMD to understand genetic and hereditary factors that may cause the disease - looking at certain anti-inflammatory treatments for the wet form of AMD studying the possibility of transplanting healthy cells into a diseased retina evaluating families with a history of AMD to understand genetic and hereditary factors that may cause the disease looking at certain anti-inflammatory treatments for the wet form of AMD This research should provide better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with AMD."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Agerelated Macular Degeneration ?","output":"Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a disease that blurs the sharp, central vision you need for straight-ahead activities such as reading, sewing, and driving.

People with intermediate dry AMD have either many medium-sized drusen or one or more large drusen. Some people see a blurred spot in the center of their vision. More light may be needed for reading and other tasks. In addition to drusen, people with advanced dry AMD have a breakdown of light-sensitive cells and supporting tissue in the macula.

It is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease. Osteoarthritis occurs when cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of the bones within the joints, breaks down and wears away. In some cases, all of the cartilage may wear away, leaving bones that rub up against each other. Joint Stiffness and Pain Symptoms range from stiffness and mild pain that comes and goes to severe joint pain. Osteoarthritis affects hands, low back, neck, and weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and feet. osteoarthritis affects just joints, not internal organs. Hands Osteoarthritis of the hands seems to run in families. If your mother or grandmother has or had osteoarthritis in their hands, youre at greater-than-average risk of having it too. Women are more likely than men to have osteoarthritis in the hands. For most women, it develops after menopause. When osteoarthritis involves the hands, small, bony knobs may appear on the end joints (those closest to the nails) of the fingers. They are called Heberdens (HEBerr-denz) nodes. Similar knobs, called Bouchards (boo-SHARDZ) nodes, can appear on the middle joints of the fingers. Fingers can become enlarged and gnarled, and they may ache or be stiff and numb. The base of the thumb joint also is commonly affected by osteoarthritis. Knees The knees are among the joints most commonly affected by osteoarthritis. Symptoms of knee osteoarthritis include stiffness, swelling, and pain, which make it hard to walk, climb, and get in and out of chairs and bathtubs. Osteoarthritis in the knees can lead to disability. Hips The hips are also common sites of osteoarthritis. As with knee osteoarthritis, symptoms of hip osteoarthritis include pain and stiffness of the joint itself. But sometimes pain is felt in the groin, inner thigh, buttocks, or even the knees. Osteoarthritis of the hip may limit moving and bending, making daily activities such as dressing and putting on shoes a challenge. Spine Osteoarthritis of the spine may show up as stiffness and pain in the neck or lower back. In some cases, arthritis-related changes in the spine can cause pressure on the nerves where they exit the spinal column, resulting in weakness, tingling, or numbness of the arms and legs. In severe cases, this can even affect bladder and bowel function."},{"instruction":"What causes Osteoarthritis ?","output":"Risk Increases With Age Researchers suspect that osteoarthritis is caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment.

Not everyone with osteoarthritis feels pain, however. In fact, only a third of people with x-ray evidence of osteoarthritis report pain or other symptoms. Diagnosis To make a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, most doctors use a combination of methods and tests including a medical history, a physical examination, x-rays, and laboratory tests. - A medical history is the patient's description of symptoms and when and how they began. The description covers pain, stiffness, and joint function, and how these have changed over time. - A physical examination includes the doctor's examination of the joints, skin, reflexes, and muscle strength. The doctor observes the patient's ability to walk, bend, and carry out activities of daily living. - X-rays are limited in their capacity to reveal how much joint damage may have occurred in osteoarthritis. X-rays usually don't show osteoarthritis damage until there has been a significant loss of cartilage. A medical history is the patient's description of symptoms and when and how they began.

Questions Your Doctor May Ask It is important for people with joint pain to give the doctor a complete medical history. Answering these questions will help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis: - Is the pain in one or more joints? - When does the pain occur and how long does it last? - When did you first notice the pain? - Does activity make the pain better or worse? - Have you had any illnesses or accidents that may account for the pain? - Is there a family history of any arthritis or rheumatic diseases? - What medicines are you taking? Is the pain in one or more joints? When does the pain occur and how long does it last? When did you first notice the pain? Does activity make the pain better or worse? Have you had any illnesses or accidents that may account for the pain? Is there a family history of any arthritis or rheumatic diseases? What medicines are you taking? A patient's attitudes, daily activities, and levels of anxiety or depression have a lot to do with how severe the symptoms of osteoarthritis may be. Who Can Provide Care Treating arthritis often requires a multidisciplinary or team approach. Many types of health professionals care for people with arthritis. You may choose a few or more of the following professionals to be part of your health care team. - Primary care physicians -- doctors who treat patients before they are referred to other specialists in the health care system.

Such plans can include exercise, rest and joint care, pain relief, weight control, medicines, surgery, and non-traditional treatment approaches. Current treatments for osteoarthritis can relieve symptoms such as pain and disability, but right now there are no treatments that can cure osteoarthritis. Exercise: One of the Best Treatments Exercise is one of the best treatments for osteoarthritis. It can improve mood and outlook, decrease pain, increase flexibility, and help you maintain a healthy weight. The amount and form of exercise will depend on which joints are involved, how stable the joints are, whether or not the joint is swollen, and whether a joint replacement has already been done. Ask your doctor or physical therapist what exercises are best for you The following types of exercise are part of a well-rounded arthritis treatment plan. - Strengthening exercises. These exercises strengthen muscles that support joints affected by arthritis. They can be performed with weights or with exercise bands, inexpensive devices that add resistance. - Aerobic activities. These are exercises, such as brisk walking or low-impact aerobics, that get your heart pumping and can keep your lungs and circulatory system in shape. - Range-of-motion activities. These keep your joints limber. - Balance and agility exercises. These help you maintain your balance and reduce the risk of falling. Strengthening exercises.

Weight Control If you are overweight or obese, you should try to lose weight. Weight loss can reduce stress on weight-bearing joints, limit further injury, increase mobility, and reduce the risk of associated health problems. A dietitian can help you develop healthy eating habits. A healthy diet and regular exercise help reduce weight. Rest and Relief from Stress on Joints Treatment plans include regularly scheduled rest. You must learn to recognize the bodys signals, and know when to stop or slow down. This will prevent the pain caused by overexertion. Although pain can make it difficult to sleep, getting proper sleep is important for managing arthritis pain. If you have trouble sleeping, you may find that relaxation techniques, stress reduction, and biofeedback can help. Timing medications to provide maximum pain relief through the night can also help. If joint pain interferes with your ability to sleep or rest, consult your doctor. Some people find relief from special footwear and insoles that can reduce pain and improve walking or from using canes to take pressure off painful joints. They may use splints or braces to provide extra support for joints and/ or keep them in proper position during sleep or activity. Splints should be used only for limited periods of time because joints and muscles need to be exercised to prevent stiffness and weakness. If you need a splint, an occupational therapist or a doctor can help you get a properly fitted one. Non-drug Pain Relief and Alternative Therapies People with osteoarthritis may find many nondrug ways to relieve pain. Below are some examples. - Heat and cold. Heat or cold (or a combination of the two) can be useful for joint pain. Heat can be applied in a number of different ways -- with warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower -- to increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness. In some cases, cold packs (bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel), which reduce inflammation, can relieve pain or numb the sore area.

Some people have found pain relief using acupuncture, a practice in which fine needles are inserted by a licensed acupuncture therapist at specific points on the skin. Scientists think the needles stimulate the release of natural, pain-relieving chemicals produced by the nervous system. A large study supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) revealed that acupuncture relieves pain and improves function in knee osteoarthritis, and it serves as an effective complement to standard care.

For general information on alternative therapies, see the Complementary Health Approaches topic. Medications Doctors consider a number of factors when choosing medicines for their patients. In particular, they look at the type of pain the patient may be having and any possible side effects from the drugs. For pain relief, doctors usually start with acetaminophen because the side effects are minimal. If acetaminophen does not relieve pain, then non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen may be used. Some NSAIDs are available over the counter, while more than a dozen others, including a subclass called COX-2 inhibitors, are available only with a prescription. Other medications, including corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and topical creams are also used. Reduce the Risks of NSAID Use Most medicines used to treat osteoarthritis have side effects, so it is important for people to learn about the medicines they take. For example, people over age 65 and those with any history of ulcers or stomach bleeding should use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, with caution. There are measures you can take to help reduce the risk of side effects associated with NSAIDs. These include taking medications with food and avoiding stomach irritants such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. In some cases, it may help to take another medication along with an NSAID to coat the stomach or block stomach acids. Although these measures may help, they are not always completely effective. For more tips on how older adults can avoid side effects, see Side Effects in the Taking Medicines topic. Surgery For many people, surgery helps relieve the pain and disability of osteoarthritis. Surgery may be performed to achieve one or more of the following goals. - Removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement). - Repositioning of bones (osteotomy). - Resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). Removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement). Repositioning of bones (osteotomy). Resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). Joint Replacement Surgeons may replace affected joints with artificial joints called prostheses. These joints can be made from metal alloys, high-density plastic, and ceramic material. Some prostheses are joined to bone surfaces with special cements. Others have porous surfaces and rely on the growth of bone into that surface (a process called biologic fixation) to hold them in place. Artificial joints can last 10 to 15 years or longer. Surgeons choose the design and components of prostheses according to their patients weight, sex, age, activity level, and other medical conditions. Joint replacement advances in recent years have included the ability, in some cases, to replace only the damaged part of the knee joint, leaving undamaged parts of the joint intact, and the ability to perform hip replacement through much smaller incisions than previously possible. For more on joint replacement see the Hip Replacement and Knee Replacement topics. Deciding on Surgery The decision to use surgery depends on several factors, including the patients age, occupation, level of disability, pain intensity, and the degree to which arthritis interferes with his or her lifestyle. After surgery and rehabilitation, the patient usually feels less pain and swelling and can move more easily."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Osteoarthritis ?","output":"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis among older people. It affects hands, low back, neck, and weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and feet. Osteoarthritis occurs when cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of the bones within the joints, breaks down and wears away. This causes bones to rub together, causing pain, swelling, and loss of motion of the joint."},{"instruction":"w many people are affected by Osteoarthritis ?","output":"The chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. It is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease."},{"instruction":"What causes Osteoarthritis ?","output":"Osteoarthritis often results from years of wear and tear on joints. This wear and tear mostly affects the cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of bones within the joint. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage begins to fray, wear away, and decay. Putting too much stress on a joint that has been repeatedly injured may lead to the development of osteoarthritis, too. A person who is overweight is more likely to develop osteoarthritis because of too much stress on the joints. Also, improper joint alignment may lead to the development of osteoarthritis."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Osteoarthritis ?","output":"Warning signs of osteoarthritis include - joint pain - swelling or tenderness in one or more joints - stiffness after getting out of bed or sitting for a long time - a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone. joint pain swelling or tenderness in one or more joints stiffness after getting out of bed or sitting for a long time a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone.

Normally, cells grow, divide and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy. Sometimes, however, the process goes wrong. Cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way. These extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. Tumors can be benign, which means not cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous. Breast cancer occurs when malignant tumors form in the breast tissue. Who Gets Breast Cancer? Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in American women. It is most common among women between the ages of 45-85. (Watch the video to learn more about breast cancer survival rates.

Men can get breast cancer too, although they account for only 1 percent of all reported cases. Read more about breast cancer in men. When Breast Cancer Spreads When cancer grows in breast tissue and spreads outside the breast, cancer cells are often found in the lymph nodes under the arm. If the cancer has reached these nodes, it means that cancer cells may have spread, or metastasized, to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads from its original location in the breast to another part of the body such as the brain, it is called metastatic breast cancer, not brain cancer. Doctors sometimes call this \\"distant\\" disease. Learn about different kinds of breast cancer. Breast Cancer is Not Contagious Breast cancer is not contagious. A woman cannot \\"catch\\" breast cancer from other women who have the disease. Also, breast cancer is not caused by an injury to the breast. Most women who develop breast cancer do not have any known risk factors or a history of the disease in their families. Treating and Surviving Breast Cancer Today, more women are surviving breast cancer than ever before. Nearly three million women are breast cancer survivors. (Watch the video to hear a woman discuss surviving breast cancer.) There are several ways to treat breast cancer, but all treatments work best when the disease is found early. As a matter of fact, when it is caught in its earliest stage, 98.5 percent of women with the disease are alive five years later. Every day researchers are working to find new and better ways to detect and treat cancer. Many studies of new approaches for women with breast cancer are under way. With early detection, and prompt and appropriate treatment, the outlook for women with breast cancer can be positive. To learn more about what happens after treatment, see Surviving Cancer."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Breast Cancer? ?","output":"Some women develop breast cancer and others do not, and the risk factors for the disease vary. Breast cancer may affect younger women, but three-fourths of all breast cancers occur in women between the ages of 45 to 85. In Situ and Invasive Breast Cancer Researchers often talk about breast cancer in two ways: in situ and invasive. In situ refers to cancer that has not spread beyond its site of origin. Invasive applies to cancer that has spread to the tissue around it. This chart shows what the approximate chances are of a woman getting invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. Risk Factors Risk factors are conditions or agents that increase a person's chances of getting a disease. Here are the most common risk factors for breast cancer. - Older age.

Don't Ignore Symptoms You should see your doctor about any symptoms like these. Most often, they are not cancer, but it's important to check with the doctor so that any problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Some women believe that as they age, health problems are due to \\"growing older.\\" Because of this myth, many illnesses go undiagnosed and untreated. Don't ignore your symptoms because you think they are not important or because you believe they are normal for your age. Talk to your doctor."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Breast Cancer? ?","output":"What Is Cancer Prevention? Cancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer. When studying ways to prevent cancer, scientists look at risk factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor. Anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor. Risk Factors Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. For example, both smoking and inheriting certain genes are risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy diet may be protective factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does not mean that you will not get cancer. Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including - changing lifestyle or eating habits - avoiding things known to cause cancer - taking medicine to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting. changing lifestyle or eating habits avoiding things known to cause cancer taking medicine to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting. (For more on risk factors, see the chapter on \\"Risk Factors.\\") Here are protective factors for breast cancer. Less Exposure to Estrogen Decreasing the length of time a woman's breast tissue is exposed to estrogen may help lower her risk of developing breast cancer. Exposure to estrogen is reduced in the following ways. - Early pregnancy. Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy. Women who have a full-term pregnancy before age 20 have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have not had children or who give birth to their first child after age 35. - Breast-feeding. Estrogen levels may remain lower while a woman is breast-feeding. Women who breastfed have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have had children but did not breastfeed. - Surgical removal of the ovaries. The ovaries make estrogen. The amount of estrogen made by the body can be greatly reduced by removing one or both ovaries. Also, drugs may be taken to lower the amount of estrogen made by the ovaries. - Late menstruation. Menstrual periods that start at age 14 or older decreases the number of years the breast tissue is exposed to estrogen. - Early menopause. The fewer years a woman menstruates, the shorter the time her breast tissue is exposed to estrogen. Early pregnancy. Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy.

For exercises tailored to older adults, visit Go4Life, the exercise and physical activity campaign from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at NIH. Estrogen-only Hormone Therapy After Hysterectomy Hormone therapy with estrogen only may be given to women who have had a hysterectomy. In these women, estrogen-only therapy after menopause may decrease the risk of breast cancer. There is an increased risk of stroke and heart and blood vessel disease in postmenopausal women who take estrogen after a hysterectomy. Learn about menopausal hormone therapy and cancer. Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) Tamoxifen and raloxifene belong to the family of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). SERMs act like estrogen on some tissues in the body, but block the effect of estrogen on other tissues. Treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene lowers the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen also lowers the risk of breast cancer in high-risk premenopausal women. With either drug, the reduced risk lasts for several years after treatment is stopped. Lower rates of broken bones have been noted in patients taking raloxifene. Prophylactic Mastectomy Some women who have a high risk of breast cancer may choose to have a prophylactic mastectomy (the removal of both breasts when there are no signs of cancer). The risk of breast cancer is much lower in these women and most feel less anxious about their risk of breast cancer. However, it is very important to have cancer risk assessment and counseling about the different ways to prevent breast cancer before making this decision. Learn more about surgery to reduce the risk of breast cancer. Prophylactic Oophorectomy Premenopausal women who have a high risk of breast cancer due to certain changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may choose to have a prophylactic oophorectomy (the removal of both ovaries when there are no signs of cancer). This decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body and lowers the risk of breast cancer. Prophylactic oophorectomy also lowers the risk of breast cancer in normal premenopausal women and in women with an increased risk of breast cancer due to radiation to the chest. However, it is very important to have cancer risk assessment and counseling before making this decision. The sudden drop in estrogen levels may cause the symptoms of menopause to begin. These include hot flashes, trouble sleeping, anxiety, and depression. Long-term effects include decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness, and decreased bone density. Unclear As Risk Factors It is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer. - Oral contraceptives. Taking oral contraceptives (\\"the pill\\") may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in current users. This risk decreases over time. Some oral contraceptives contain estrogen. Progestin-only contraceptives that are injected or implanted do not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer. - Environment.

That is why it's important to have regular tests to check for cancer long before you might notice anything wrong. Detecting Breast Cancer Through Screening When breast cancer is found early, it is more likely to be treated successfully. Checking for cancer in a person who does not have any symptoms is called screening. Screening tests for breast cancer include, among others, clinical breast exams and mammograms. Recent studies have shown that ultrasound and MRI's may also be useful complementary screening tools, particularly in women with mammograms that are not definitive. During a clinical breast exam, the doctor or other health care professional checks the breasts and underarms for lumps or other changes that could be a sign of breast cancer. A mammogram is a special x-ray of the breast that often can detect cancers that are too small for a woman or her doctor to feel. (Watch the video to learn more about digital mammography and dense breasts. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Who Should Have a Mammography? Several studies show that mammography screening has reduced the number of deaths from breast cancer. However, some other studies have not shown a clear benefit from mammography. Scientists are continuing to examine the level of benefit that mammography can produce. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a screening mammography for women 50-74 years every two years. Learn more about the USPSTF mammography recommendations here. Between 5 and 10 percent of mammogram results are abnormal and require more testing. Most of these follow-up tests confirm that no cancer was present. Worried about the cost of a mammogram? Learn about free and low-cost screenings. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) How Biopsies are Performed If needed, the most common follow-up test a doctor will recommend is called a biopsy. This is a procedure where a small amount of fluid or tissue is removed from the breast to make a diagnosis. A doctor might perform fine needle aspiration, a needle or core biopsy, or a surgical biopsy. - With fine needle aspiration, doctors numb the area and use a thin needle to remove fluid and/or cells from a breast lump. If the fluid is clear, it may not need to be checked out by a lab. - For a needle biopsy, sometimes called a core biopsy, doctors use a needle to remove tissue from an area that looks suspicious on a mammogram but cannot be felt. This tissue goes to a lab where a pathologist examines it to see if any of the cells are cancerous. - In a surgical biopsy, a surgeon removes a sample of a lump or suspicious area. Sometimes it is necessary to remove the entire lump or suspicious area, plus an area of healthy tissue around the edges. The tissue then goes to a lab where a pathologist examines it under a microscope to check for cancer cells. With fine needle aspiration, doctors numb the area and use a thin needle to remove fluid and/or cells from a breast lump. If the fluid is clear, it may not need to be checked out by a lab. For a needle biopsy, sometimes called a core biopsy, doctors use a needle to remove tissue from an area that looks suspicious on a mammogram but cannot be felt. This tissue goes to a lab where a pathologist examines it to see if any of the cells are cancerous. In a surgical biopsy, a surgeon removes a sample of a lump or suspicious area. Sometimes it is necessary to remove the entire lump or suspicious area, plus an area of healthy tissue around the edges. The tissue then goes to a lab where a pathologist examines it under a microscope to check for cancer cells. Another type of surgical biopsy that removes less breast tissue is called an image-guided needle breast biopsy, or stereotactic biopsy. Eighty percent of U.S. women who have a surgical breast biopsy do not have cancer. However, women who have breast biopsies are at higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who have never had a breast biopsy. Other Detection Methods Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, and ultrasound are two other techniques which, as supplements to standard mammography, might help detect breast cancer with greater accuracy. Genetic Detection The most comprehensive study to date of gene mutations in breast cancer, published in September 2012, confirmed that there are four primary subtypes of breast cancer, each with its own biology. The four groups are called intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer and include HER2-enriched (HER2E), Luminal A (LumA), Luminal B (LumB) and Basal-like. The outlook for survival is different for each of these subtypes of breast cancer. Researchers found that one subtype, Basal-like breast cancer, shares many genetic features with a form of ovarian cancer, and that both may respond similarly to drugs that reduce tumor growth or target DNA repair. The authors hope that discovery of these mutations will be an important step in the effort to improve therapies for breast cancer. For the time being, there are no genetic tests that are commercially available based solely on these findings. Soon, however, knowing extensively which breast cancer gene mutations a woman has should help guide precision treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Breast Cancer ?","output":"There are many treatment options for women with breast cancer. The choice of treatment depends on your age and general health, the stage of the cancer, whether or not it has spread beyond the breast, and other factors. If tests show that you have cancer, you should talk with your doctor and make treatment decisions as soon as possible. Studies show that early treatment leads to better outcomes. Working With a Team of Specialists People with cancer often are treated by a team of specialists. The team will keep the primary doctor informed about the patient's progress. The team may include a medical oncologist who is a specialist in cancer treatment, a surgeon, a radiation oncologist who is a specialist in radiation therapy, and others. Before starting treatment, you may want another doctor to review the diagnosis and treatment plan. Some insurance companies require a second opinion. Others may pay for a second opinion if you request it. (Watch the video about this breast cancer survivor's treatment. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner.

These studies, called clinical trials, are designed to find out whether a new treatment is both safe and effective. Often, clinical trials compare a new treatment with a standard one so that doctors can learn which is more effective. Women with breast cancer who are interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk to their doctor. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through its National Library of Medicine and other Institutes, maintains a database of clinical trials at ClinicalTrials.gov. See a list of the current clinical trials on breast cancer."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Breast Cancer ?","output":"There are a number of treatments for breast cancer, but the ones women choose most often -- alone or in combination -- are surgery, hormone therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. What Standard Treatments Do Here is what the standard cancer treatments are designed to do. - Surgery takes out the cancer and some surrounding tissue. - Hormone therapy keeps cancer cells from getting most of the hormones they need to survive and grow. - Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors and some surrounding tissue. - Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to kill most cancer cells. Surgery takes out the cancer and some surrounding tissue. Hormone therapy keeps cancer cells from getting most of the hormones they need to survive and grow. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors and some surrounding tissue. Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to kill most cancer cells. Treatment for breast cancer may involve local or whole body therapy. Doctors use local therapies, such as surgery or radiation, to remove or destroy breast cancer in a specific area. Whole body, or systemic, treatments like chemotherapy, hormonal, or biological therapies are used to destroy or control cancer throughout the body. Some patients have both kinds of treatment. Treating Early-Stage Breast Cancer If you have early-stage breast cancer, one common treatment available to you is a lumpectomy combined with radiation therapy. A lumpectomy is surgery that preserves a woman's breast. In a lumpectomy, the surgeon removes only the tumor and a small amount of the surrounding tissue. The survival rate for a woman who has this therapy plus radiation is similar to that for a woman who chooses a radical mastectomy, which is complete removal of a breast. If Cancer Has Spread Locally If you have breast cancer that has spread locally -- just to other parts of the breast -- your treatment may involve a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Doctors usually first shrink the tumor with chemotherapy and then remove it through surgery. Shrinking the tumor before surgery may allow a woman to avoid a mastectomy and keep her breast. In the past, doctors would remove a lot of lymph nodes near breast tumors to see if the cancer had spread. Some doctors also use a method called sentinel node biopsy. Using a dye or radioactive tracer, surgeons locate the first or sentinel lymph node closest to the tumor, and remove only that node to see if the cancer has spread. If Cancer Has Spread Beyond the Breast If the breast cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung or bone, you might receive chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy to destroy cancer cells and control the disease. Radiation therapy may also be useful to control tumors in other parts of the body.

New research shows women with early-stage breast cancer who took the drug letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, after they completed five years of tamoxifen therapy significantly reduced their risk of breast cancer recurrence. Treating HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Herceptin is a drug commonly used to treat women who have a certain type of breast cancer. This drug slows or stops the growth of cancer cells by blocking HER2, a protein found on the surface of some types of breast cancer cells. Approximately 20 to 25 percent of breast cancers produce too much HER2. These \\"HER2 positive\\" tumors tend to grow faster and are generally more likely to return than tumors that do not overproduce HER2. Results from clinical trials show that those patients with early-stage HER2 positive breast cancer who received Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy had a 52 percent decrease in risk in the cancer returning compared with patients who received chemotherapy treatment alone. Cancer treatments like chemotherapy can be systemic, meaning they affect whole tissues, organs, or the entire body. Herceptin, however, was the first drug used to target only a specific molecule involved in breast cancer. Another drug, Tykerb, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use for treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Because of the availability of these two drugs, an international trial called ALTTO was designed to determine if one drug is more effective, safer, and if taking the drugs separately, in tandem order, or together is better. Unfortunately, the results, released in 2014, showed that taking two HER2-targeted agents together was no better than taking one alone in improving survival. The TAILORx Trial In an attempt to further specialize breast cancer treatment, The Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment, or TAILORx, enrolled 10,000 women to examine whether appropriate treatment can be assigned based on genes that are frequently associated with risk of recurrence of breast cancer. The goal of TAILORx is important because the majority of women with early-stage breast cancer are advised to receive chemotherapy in addition to radiation and hormonal therapy, yet research has not demonstrated that chemotherapy benefits all of them equally. TAILORx seeks to examine many of a woman's genes simultaneously and use this information in choosing a treatment course, thus sparing women unnecessary treatment if chemotherapy is not likely to be of substantial benefit to them."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Breast Cancer ?","output":"The body is made up of many types of cells.

While glaucoma can strike anyone, the risk is much greater for people over 60. How Glaucoma Develops There are several different types of glaucoma. Most of these involve the drainage system within the eye. At the front of the eye there is a small space called the anterior chamber. A clear fluid flows through this chamber and bathes and nourishes the nearby tissues. (Watch the video to learn more about glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) In glaucoma, for still unknown reasons, the fluid drains too slowly out of the eye. As the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye rises. Unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optic nerve and other parts of the eye and result in loss of vision. Open-angle Glaucoma The most common type of glaucoma is called open-angle glaucoma. In the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. When fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. If the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. However, there are treatments that may save remaining vision. That is why early diagnosis is important. See this graphic for a quick overview of glaucoma, including how many people it affects, whos at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more. See a glossary of glaucoma terms."},{"instruction":"What causes Glaucoma ?","output":"Nearly 2.7 million people have glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Although anyone can get glaucoma, some people are at higher risk. They include - African-Americans over age 40 - everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos - people with a family history of glaucoma. African-Americans over age 40 everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos people with a family history of glaucoma. In addition to age, eye pressure is a risk factor. Whether you develop glaucoma depends on the level of pressure your optic nerve can tolerate without being damaged. This level is different for each person. Thats why a comprehensive dilated eye exam is very important. It can help your eye care professional determine what level of eye pressure is normal for you. Another risk factor for optic nerve damage relates to blood pressure. Thus, it is important to also make sure that your blood pressure is at a proper level for your body by working with your medical doctor.

The most common type of glaucoma, open-angle glaucoma, has no symptoms at first. It causes no pain, and vision seems normal. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains. Tests for Glaucoma Glaucoma is detected through a comprehensive eye exam that includes a visual acuity test, visual field test, dilated eye exam, tonometry, and pachymetry. (Watch the animated video to learn more about testing for glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner.

A visual field test measures your side or peripheral vision. It helps your eye care professional tell if you have lost side vision, a sign of glaucoma. In a dilated eye exam, drops are placed in your eyes to widen, or dilate, the pupils. Your eye care professional uses a special magnifying lens to examine your retina and optic nerve for signs of damage and other eye problems. After the exam, your close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. In tonometry, an instrument measures the pressure inside the eye. Numbing drops may be applied to your eye for this test. With pachymetry, a numbing drop is applied to your eye. Your eye care professional uses an ultrasonic wave instrument to measure the thickness of your cornea."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Glaucoma ?","output":"Although open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured, it can usually be controlled. While treatments may save remaining vision, they do not improve sight already lost from glaucoma. The most common treatments for glaucoma are medication and surgery. Medications Medications for glaucoma may be either in the form of eye drops or pills. Some drugs reduce pressure by slowing the flow of fluid into the eye. Others help to improve fluid drainage. (Watch the video to learn more about coping with glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) For most people with glaucoma, regular use of medications will control the increased fluid pressure. But, these drugs may stop working over time. Or, they may cause side effects. If a problem occurs, the eye care professional may select other drugs, change the dose, or suggest other ways to deal with the problem. Read or listen to ways some patients are coping with glaucoma. Surgery Laser surgery is another treatment for glaucoma. During laser surgery, a strong beam of light is focused on the part of the anterior chamber where the fluid leaves the eye. This results in a series of small changes that makes it easier for fluid to exit the eye. Over time, the effect of laser surgery may wear off. Patients who have this form of surgery may need to keep taking glaucoma drugs. Researching Causes and Treatments Through studies in the laboratory and with patients, NEI is seeking better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with glaucoma.

They are bean-shaped and about the size of a fist. They are located in the middle of your back, on the left and right of your spine, just below your rib cage. The kidneys filter your blood, removing wastes and extra water to make urine. They also help control blood pressure and make hormones that your body needs to stay healthy. When the kidneys are damaged, wastes can build up in the body. Kidney Function and Aging Kidney function may be reduced with aging. As the kidneys age, the number of filtering units in the kidney may decrease, the overall amount of kidney tissue may decrease, and the blood vessels that supply the kidney may harden, causing the kidneys to filter blood more slowly. If your kidneys begin to filter less well as you age, you may be more likely to have complications from certain medicines. There may be an unsafe buildup of medicines that are removed from your blood by your kidneys. Also, your kidneys may be more sensitive to certain medicines. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some antibiotics may harm your kidneys in some situations. The next time you pick up a prescription or buy an over-the-counter medicine or supplement, ask your pharmacist how the product may affect your kidneys and interact with your other medicines.

How Kidney Disease Occurs Kidney disease means the kidneys are damaged and can no longer remove wastes and extra water from the blood as they should. Kidney disease is most often caused by diabetes or high blood pressure. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 20 million Americans may have kidney disease. Many more are at risk. The main risk factors for developing kidney disease are - diabetes - high blood pressure - cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease - a family history of kidney failure. diabetes high blood pressure cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease a family history of kidney failure. Each kidney contains about one million tiny filtering units made up of blood vessels. These filters are called glomeruli. Diabetes and high blood pressure damage these blood vessels, so the kidneys are not able to filter the blood as well as they used to. Usually this damage happens slowly, over many years. This is called chronic kidney disease. As more and more filtering units are damaged, the kidneys eventually are unable to maintain health. Early kidney disease usually has no symptoms, which means you will not feel different. Blood and urine tests are the only way to check for kidney damage or measure kidney function. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure, you should be tested for kidney disease. Kidney Failure Kidney disease can get worse over time, and may lead to kidney failure. Kidney failure means very advanced kidney damage with less than 15% normal function. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is kidney failure treated by dialysis or kidney transplant. If the kidneys fail, treatment options such as dialysis or a kidney transplant can help replace kidney function. Some patients choose not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant. If your kidneys fail, talk with your health care provider about choosing a treatment that is right for you. (Watch the video to learn more about how kidney disease progresses.

Symptoms of Kidney Failure Kidney failure means that damaged kidneys are filtering less than 15% of the amount of blood filtered by healthy kidneys. If kidney disease progresses to kidney failure, a number of symptoms may occur. Some people experience fatigue, some lose their appetite, and some have leg cramps. These problems are caused by waste products that build up in the blood, a condition known as uremia. Healthy kidneys remove waste products from the blood. When the kidneys stop working, uremia occurs. The kidneys also make hormones and balance the minerals in the blood. When the kidneys stop working, most people develop conditions that affect the blood, bones, nerves, and skin. These problems may include itching, sleep problems, restless legs, weak bones, joint problems, and depression. How Kidney Disease Is Diagnosed Blood and urine tests are the only way to check for kidney damage or measure kidney function. It is important for you to get checked for kidney disease if you have the key risk factors, which are - diabetes - high blood pressure - heart disease - a family history of kidney failure. diabetes high blood pressure heart disease a family history of kidney failure. If you are at risk, ask about your kidneys at your next medical appointment. The sooner you know you have kidney disease, the sooner you can get treatment to help delay or prevent kidney failure. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure, you should get a blood and urine test to check your kidneys. Talk to your provider about how often you should be tested. (Watch the video to learn more about tests for kidney disease.) Blood Test The blood test checks your GFR. GFR stands for glomerular (glow-MAIR-you-lure) filtration rate. GFR is a measure of how much blood your kidneys filter each minute. This shows how well your kidneys are working. GFR is reported as a number. - A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. - A GFR below 60 may mean you have kidney disease. However, because GFR decreases as people age, other information may be needed to determine if you actually have kidney disease. - A GFR of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. A GFR below 60 may mean you have kidney disease. However, because GFR decreases as people age, other information may be needed to determine if you actually have kidney disease. A GFR of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure. You can't raise your GFR, but you can try to keep it from going lower. Ask your healthcare provider what you can do to keep your kidneys healthy. Learn more about the GFR test. Urine Test The urine test looks for albumin (al-BYOO-min), a type of protein, in your urine. A healthy kidney does not let albumin pass into the urine. A damaged kidney lets some albumin pass into the urine. This test has several different names. You could be told that you are being screened for \\"proteinuria\\" or \\"albuminuria\\" or \\"microalbuminuria.\\" Or you could be told that your \\"urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio\\" (UACR) is being measured. If you have albumin or protein in your urine, it could mean you have kidney disease. - A urine albumin result below 30 is normal. - A urine albumin result above 30 is not normal and may mean kidney disease.

Some are used in earlier stages of kidney disease to protect your kidneys. These medications and lifestyle changes help you maintain kidney function and delay kidney failure. Other treatments, such as dialysis and transplantation, are used to treat kidney failure. These methods help replace kidney function if your own kidneys have stopped working. Treatments for Early Kidney Disease Treatments for early kidney disease include both diet and lifestyle changes and medications. - Making heart-healthy food choices and exercising regularly to maintain a healthy weight can help prevent the diseases that cause further kidney damage. - If you already have diabetes and/or high blood pressure, keeping these conditions under control can keep them from causing further damage to your kidneys. - Choose and prepare foods with less salt and sodium. Aim for less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium each day. - Eat the right amount of protein. Although it is important to eat enough protein to stay healthy, excess protein makes your kidneys work harder. Eating less protein may help delay progression to kidney failure.

Medicines Medicines can also help protect the kidneys. People with kidney disease often take medicines to lower blood pressure, control blood glucose, and lower blood cholesterol. Two types of blood pressure medicines -- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) -- may protect the kidneys and delay kidney failure. These medicines may even protect kidney function in people who don't have high blood pressure. The most important step you can take to treat kidney disease is to control your blood pressure. Many people need two or more medicines to keep their blood pressure at a healthy level. For most people, the blood pressure target is less than 140/90 mm Hg. An ACE inhibitor, ARB, or diuretic (water pill) may help control blood pressure. Your healthcare provider will work with you to choose the right medicines for you.

If you have kidney disease, you need to be careful about all the medicines you take. Your kidneys do not filter as well as they did in the past. This can cause an unsafe buildup of medicines in your blood. Some medicines can also harm your kidneys. As kidney disease progresses, your doctor may need to change the dose (or amount) of all medicines that affect the kidney or are removed by the kidney.

Since the kidneys no longer work well enough to maintain health, it is necessary to choose a treatment in order to maintain health. There are two main options for this: dialysis and transplantation. Some patients choose not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant. Instead, they receive supportive care to treat their symptoms. Before you and your health care team decide on a treatment plan, it is important that you understand how each treatment option is likely to affect how long you will live or how good you will feel.

Two Kinds of Dialysis Dialysis is a treatment that takes waste products and extra fluid out of your body. In hemodialysis, your blood passes through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to your body. In hemodialysis, blood is run through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to the body. Hemodialysis is usually done at a dialysis center three times a week, but it can also be done at home. Each session usually lasts between three and four hours. Peritoneal dialysis is another way to remove wastes from your blood. This kind of dialysis uses the lining of your abdominal cavity (the space in your body that holds organs like the stomach, intestines, and liver) to filter your blood. It works by putting a special fluid into your abdomen that absorbs waste products in your blood as it passes through small blood vessels in this lining. This fluid with the waste products is then drained away. A key benefit of peritoneal dialysis is that it can be done at home, while you sleep. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis do not cure kidney failure. They are treatments that help replace the function of the kidneys and may help you feel better and live longer. But, for some people who have many health problems and are age 75 or older, studies show that treatment with dialysis may not help. If You Are on Dialysis Although patients with kidney failure are now living longer than ever, over the years, kidney disease can cause problems such as - depression - heart disease - bone disease - arthritis - nerve damage - malnutrition. depression heart disease bone disease arthritis nerve damage malnutrition.

Dialysis can be a special challenge for older adults, especially those who have other diseases or conditions. For example, for hemodialysis, a person must be able to leave home, travel to the dialysis facility, and sit for 4 hours during treatment. Peritoneal dialysis can be done at home, but someone needs to help. Often, older adults need help with some or all of these activities. They and their families need to think about these issues as they choose treatment options and living facilities. Learn more about dialysis. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition on Dialysis For people who are on dialysis or approaching total kidney failure, adequate nutrition is important for maintaining energy, strength, healthy sleep patterns, bone health, heart health, and good mental health. The diet should be based on the type of treatment the person is getting. - People on hemodialysis must watch how much fluid they drink and avoid eating foods with too much sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. - In contrast, people on peritoneal dialysisa type of dialysis that uses the lining of the abdomen, or belly, to filter the blood inside the bodymay be able to eat more potassium-rich foods because peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from the body more efficiently than hemodialysis. - Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can remove proteins from the body, so anyone on either form of dialysis should eat protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and eggs.

All dialysis centers have a renal dietitian, who helps people with kidney failure make healthy food choices. People who are on dialysis should talk with their clinics renal dietitian. The renal dietitian can help make a meal plan that will help their treatment work well. Kidney Transplantation Some people with kidney failure -- including older adults -- may be able to receive a kidney transplant. This involves having a healthy kidney from another person surgically placed into your body. The new, donated kidney does the work the failed kidneys used to do. The donated kidney can come from someone you dont know who has recently died, or from a living person -- usually a family member. But you might also be able to receive a kidney from an unrelated donor, including your spouse or a friend. Due to the shortage of kidneys, patients on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney may wait many years. (Watch the video to learn more about kidney transplantation.) Kidney transplantation is a treatment for kidney failure -- not a cure. You will need to see your healthcare provider regularly. And you will need to take medicines for as long as you have your transplant. These medicines suppress your immune system so it doesn't reject the transplanted kidney. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition After a Transplant After a transplant, it is still important to make healthy food choices. It is still important to eat foods with less salt. This may help you keep a healthy blood pressure. You should also choose foods that are healthy for your heart, like fresh fruits, fresh or frozen vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods. If you were on dialysis before the transplant, you may find that your diet after transplant is much easier to follow. You can drink more fluids and eat many of the fruits and vegetables you had to eat less of while on dialysis. You may even need to gain a little weight, but be careful not to gain weight too quickly. All transplant clinics have a renal dietitian, who helps people with kidney failure make healthy food choices. People who have had a transplant should talk with their clinics renal dietitian. The renal dietitian can help make a meal plan that will help keep the new kidney healthy. Learn more about kidney transplantation. Choosing Not to Treat With Dialysis or Transplant You may choose not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant. Instead, you may choose to focus on treating its complications. If you choose this path, you will still get care from your health care team. Your care may include - medicines to protect remaining kidney function for as long as possible - medicines to treat symptoms of kidney failure (such as nausea, anemia, and poor appetite) - advice on diet and lifestyle choices, and - care to ease symptoms, provide relief from physical and emotional pain, and enhance quality of life. medicines to protect remaining kidney function for as long as possible medicines to treat symptoms of kidney failure (such as nausea, anemia, and poor appetite) advice on diet and lifestyle choices, and care to ease symptoms, provide relief from physical and emotional pain, and enhance quality of life.

Several areas of research supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) hold great potential. Emphasis is being placed on research related to prevention and early intervention in kidney disease. Interaction With Other Diseases Another focus is on the interaction between kidney disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular (heart) disease. Advances in treatments for diabetes and high blood pressure may help reduce the damage these conditions do to the kidneys in the first place. Research into how to predict who will develop kidney disease may improve prevention. Disease Progression NIDDK is sponsoring a major study -- the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study -- to learn more about how kidney disease progresses. CRIC is following 6,000 adults with mild to moderate kidney disease. About half have diabetes. It is believed that some CRIC study participants' kidney function will decline more rapidly than others', and that some will develop cardiovascular disease while others won't. The goal of the study is to identify the factors linked to rapid decline of kidney function and the development of cardiovascular disease. The data and specimens collected from study participants will be available to other researchers who are studying kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The CRIC study will allow future investigation into the role of genetic, environmental, behavioral, nutritional, and other factors in kidney disease. Learn more about the CRIC Study. Improving Transplants In the area of transplantation, researchers are working to develop new drugs that help the body accept donated organs. The goal is to help transplanted kidneys survive longer and work better. NIDDK scientists are also developing new techniques to improve the body's tolerance for foreign tissue even before the donated kidney is transplanted. This could help reduce or eliminate the need for drugs that suppress the immune system, which could reduce transplantation costs and complications.

Each kidney contains about one million tiny filters made up of blood vessels. These filters are called glomeruli. Diabetes and high blood pressure damage these blood vessels, so the kidneys are not able to filter the blood as well as they used to. Usually this damage happens slowly, over many years. As more and more filters are damaged, the kidneys eventually stop working."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Kidney Disease? ?","output":"Diabetes and high blood pressure are the two leading risk factors for kidney disease. Both diabetes and high blood pressure damage the small blood vessels in your kidneys and can cause kidney disease -- without you feeling it. There are several other risk factors for kidney disease. Cardiovascular (heart) disease is a risk factor. So is family history: if you have a mother, father, sister, or brother who has had kidney disease, then you are at increased risk. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans tend to have a greater risk for kidney failure. This is mostly due to higher rates of diabetes and high blood pressure in these communities, although there may be other reasons.

Kidney failure causes harmful waste and excess fluid to build up in your body. Your blood pressure may rise, and your hands and feet may swell. Since the kidneys are not working well, the goal is to find treatments that can replace kidney function in order to maintain health. There are two main options for this: dialysis and transplantation."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Kidney Disease ?","output":"Dialysis is a treatment to filter wastes and water from your blood. There are two major forms of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. (Watch the video to learn more about dialysis. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) In hemodialysis, blood is run through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to the body. Hemodialysis is usually done at a dialysis center three times a week, but it can also be done at home. Each session usually lasts between three and four hours. Peritoneal dialysis is another way to remove wastes from your blood. This kind of dialysis uses the lining of your abdominal cavity (the space in your body that holds organs like the stomach, intestines, and liver) to filter your blood. It works by putting a special fluid into your abdomen that absorbs waste products in your blood as it passes through small blood vessels in this lining. This fluid is then drained away. A key benefit of peritoneal dialysis is that it can be done at home, while you sleep.

This involves having a healthy kidney from another person surgically placed into your body. The new, donated kidney does the work that your two failed kidneys used to do. The donated kidney can come from an anonymous donor who has recently died, or from a living person -- usually a relative. But you might also be able to receive a kidney from an unrelated donor, including your spouse or a friend. (Watch the video to learn more about kidney transplantation.

Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrous tissue, and other substances in the blood. When plaque builds up in the body's arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis). Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body. P.A.D. usually affects the arteries in the legs, but it can also affect the arteries that carry blood from your heart to your head, arms, kidneys, and stomach. Blocked blood flow to your legs can cause pain and numbness. It also can raise your risk of getting an infection in the affected limbs. Your body may have a hard time fighting the infection. Why is P.A.D. Dangerous? Over time, the plaque may crack and cause blood clots to form. These blood clots can block arteries, causing pain, numbness, inflammation, and even permanent tissue damage in the affected part of the body. If severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause tissue death (also called gangrene.) In very serious cases, this can lead to leg amputation. P.A.D. currently affects 8 million to 12 million Americans. About 1 in every 20 Americans over the age of 50 has P.A.D. African Americans are more than twice as likely as Caucasians to have P.A.D. If you have P.A.D., your risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack (\\"mini-stroke\\") is much higher than in people without P.A.D. If you have coronary artery disease, you have a 1 in 3 chance of having blocked leg arteries. Although P.A.D. is serious, it is treatable. If you have the disease, it's important to see your doctor regularly and treat the underlying atherosclerosis.

These factors include - smoking - high amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood - high blood pressure - high amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes. smoking high amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood high blood pressure high amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes. The major risk factors for P.A.D. are smoking, older age, and having certain diseases or conditions. The Effects of Smoking Smoking is the main risk factor for P.A.D. Your risk of P.A.D. increases four times if you smoke or have a history of smoking. On average, people who smoke and develop P.A.D. have symptoms 10 years earlier than people who don't smoke and develop P.A.D. Quitting smoking slows the progress of P.A.D. Smoking even one or two cigarettes a day can interfere with P.A.D. treatments. People who smoke and people who have diabetes are at highest risk for P.A.D. complications such as gangrene (tissue death) in the leg from decreased blood flow. Older Age Older age also is a risk factor for P.A.D. Plaque builds up in your arteries as you age. About 1 in every 20 Americans over the age of 50 has P.A.D. The risk continues to rise as you get older. Older age combined with other factors, such as smoking or diabetes, also puts you at higher risk for P.A.D. Diseases That Put You at Risk Many diseases and conditions can raise your risk of P.A.D., including - diabetes. About 1 in 3 people older than 50 who has diabetes also has P.A.D. - high blood pressure - high blood cholesterol - coronary heart disease (CHD) - stroke - metabolic syndrome (a group of risk factors that raise your risk of CHD and other health problems, such as P.A.D., stroke, and diabetes). diabetes.

The Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of P.A.D. He or she may check the blood flow in your legs or feet to see whether you have weak or absent pulses. Your doctor also may check the pulses in your leg arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-E). He or she can hear this sound with a stethoscope. A bruit may be a warning sign of a narrowed or blocked artery. Your doctor may compare blood pressure between your limbs to see whether the pressure is lower in the affected limb.

It can cause mild to severe symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis not only affects the joints, but may also attack tissue in the skin, lungs, eyes, and blood vessels. People with rheumatoid arthritis may feel sick, tired, and sometimes feverish. Rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system turns against parts of the body it is designed to protect. Rheumatoid arthritis generally occurs in a symmetrical pattern. This means that if one knee or hand is involved, the other one is, too. It can occur at any age, but usually begins during a person's most productive years. Affects More Women Than Men Rheumatoid arthritis occurs much more frequently in women than in men. About two to three times as many women as men have the disease. Learn more about how rheumatoid arthritis occurs. Effects Vary Rheumatoid arthritis affects people differently. Some people have mild or moderate forms of the disease, with periods of worsening symptoms, called flares, and periods in which they feel better, called remissions. Others have a severe form of the disease that is active most of the time, lasts for many years or a lifetime, and leads to serious joint damage and disability. Although rheumatoid arthritis is primarily a disease of the joints, its effects are not just physical. Many people with rheumatoid arthritis also experience issues related to - depression, anxiety - feelings of helplessness - low self-esteem. depression, anxiety feelings of helplessness low self-esteem. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect virtually every area of a persons life from work life to family life. It can also interfere with the joys and responsibilities of family life and may affect the decision to have children. Treatment Can Help Fortunately, current treatment strategies allow most people with the disease to lead active and productive lives. These strategies include pain-relieving drugs and medications that slow joint damage, a balance between rest and exercise, and patient education and support programs.

Balance Rest and Exercise People with rheumatoid arthritis need a good balance between rest and exercise; they should rest more when the disease is active and exercise more when it is not. Rest helps to reduce active joint inflammation and pain and to fight fatigue. The length of time for rest will vary from person to person, but in general, shorter rest breaks every now and then are more helpful than long times spent in bed. Exercise is important for maintaining healthy and strong muscles, preserving joint mobility, and maintaining flexibility. Exercise can also help people sleep well, reduce pain, maintain a positive attitude, and manage weight. Exercise programs should take into account the persons physical abilities, limitations, and changing needs. Learn more about the health benefits of exercise for older adults. More information about exercise and physical activity for older adults can be found at Go4Life, the exercise and physical activity campaign from the National Institute on Aging. Reduce Stress People with rheumatoid arthritis face emotional challenges as well as physical ones. The emotions they feel because of the diseasefear, anger, and frustrationcombined with any pain and physical limitations can increase their stress level. Finding ways to reduce stress is important. Regular rest periods can help and so can relaxation, distraction, or visualization exercises. Exercise programs, participation in support groups, and good communication with the health care team are other ways to reduce stress. For more information on exercise classes, you may want to contact the Arthritis Foundation at 1-800-283-7800. Learn about relaxation techniques that may relieve tension.

Reduce Stress on Joints Some people find using a splint for a short time around a painful joint reduces pain and swelling by supporting the joint and letting it rest. Splints are used mostly on wrists and hands, but also on ankles and feet. A doctor or a physical or occupational therapist can help a person choose a splint and make sure it fits properly. Other ways to reduce stress on joints include - self-help devices (for example, zipper pullers, long-handled shoe horns) - devices to help with getting on and off chairs, toilet seats, and beds - changes in the ways that a person carries out daily activities. self-help devices (for example, zipper pullers, long-handled shoe horns) devices to help with getting on and off chairs, toilet seats, and beds changes in the ways that a person carries out daily activities. Medications Most people who have rheumatoid arthritis take medications. Some drugs only provide relief for pain; others reduce inflammation.

Surgery In some cases, a doctor will recommend surgery to restore function or relieve pain in a damaged joint. Surgery may also improve a person's ability to perform daily activities. Joint replacement and tendon reconstruction are two types of surgery available to patients with severe joint damage. Routine Monitoring and Ongoing Care Regular medical care is important to monitor the course of the disease, determine the effectiveness and any negative effects of medications, and change therapies as needed. Monitoring typically includes regular visits to the doctor. It also may include blood, urine, and other laboratory tests and x rays. Monitor Osteoporosis Risk People with rheumatoid arthritis may want to discuss preventing osteoporosis with their doctors as part of their long-term, ongoing care. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become weakened and fragile. Having rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women, particularly if a person takes corticosteroids. Such patients may want to discuss with their doctors the potential benefits of calcium and vitamin D supplements or other treatments for osteoporosis.

Investigators are trying to identify the infectious agents and understand how they work. This knowledge could lead to new therapies. Why More Women Than Men? Researchers are also exploring why so many more women than men develop rheumatoid arthritis. In the hope of finding clues, they are studying complex relationships between the hormonal, nervous, and immune systems in rheumatoid arthritis.

It occurs when diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels inside the retina in the back of the eye. A healthy retina is necessary for good vision. If you have diabetic retinopathy, at first you may notice no changes to your vision. But over time, diabetic retinopathy can get worse and cause vision loss. Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes. Four Stages The four stages of diabetic retinopathy are - mild nonproliferative retinopathy - moderate nonproliferative retinopathy - severe nonproliferative retinopathy - proliferative retinopathy. mild nonproliferative retinopathy moderate nonproliferative retinopathy severe nonproliferative retinopathy proliferative retinopathy. The first stage is mild nonproliferative retinopathy. At this earliest stage, there are small areas of balloon-like swelling in the retina's tiny blood vessels. The second stage is moderate nonproliferative retinopathy. As the disease progresses, some blood vessels that nourish the retina are blocked. The third stage is severe nonproliferative retinopathy. Many more blood vessels are blocked, depriving several areas of the retina of their blood supply. These areas send signals to the body to grow new blood vessels for nourishment. The fourth stage is proliferative retinopathy. At this advanced stage, the signals sent by the retina for nourishment cause the growth of new blood vessels. These new blood vessels are abnormal and fragile. The new blood vessels grow along the retina and along the surface of the clear, vitreous gel that fills the inside of the eye. By themselves, these blood vessels do not cause symptoms or vision loss. However, they have thin, fragile walls. If they leak blood, severe vision loss and even blindness can result. Other Diabetic Eye Diseases In addition to diabetic retinopathy, other diabetic eye diseases that people with diabetes may face are cataract and glaucoma. See this graphic for a quick overview of diabetic eye disease, including how many people it affects, whos at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more."},{"instruction":"What causes Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"Who Is at Risk? All people with diabetes -- both type 1 and type 2 -- are at risk for diabetic retinopathy. People with diabetes are also at increased risk for cataract and glaucoma. That's why everyone with diabetes should get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Between 40 to 45 percent of Americans diagnosed with diabetes have some stage of diabetic retinopathy. If you have diabetic retinopathy, your doctor can recommend treatment to help prevent its progression. How Vision Loss Occurs Blood vessels damaged from diabetic retinopathy can cause vision loss in two ways. Fragile, abnormal blood vessels can develop and leak blood into the center of the eye, blurring vision. This is proliferative retinopathy and is the fourth and most advanced stage of the disease. Fluid can leak into the center of the macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs. The fluid makes the macula swell, blurring vision. This condition is called macular edema. Macular edema can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, although it is more likely to occur as the disease progresses. About half of the people with proliferative retinopathy also have macular edema. Macular edema can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, although it is more likely to occur as the disease progresses.

Watch an animation to see what a comprehensive dilated eye exam includes."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Don't wait for symptoms. Be sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year to detect the disease before it causes damage to your vision. Vision Changes May Indicate Bleeding In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, you may not notice any changes in your vision. But if diabetic retinopathy reaches its final stage, proliferative retinopathy, bleeding can occur. If this happens, at first, you will see a few specks of blood, or spots, floating in your vision. If spots occur, see your eye care professional as soon as possible. Early Treatment is Important You may need treatment before more serious bleeding or hemorrhages occur causing vision loss or possibly blindness. Hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep. See how to find an eye care professional. Here is a list of questions to ask your eye care professional. Sometimes the spots clear without treatment, and you will see better. However, bleeding can reoccur and cause severely blurred vision. You need to be examined by your eye care professional at the first sign of blurred vision, before more bleeding occurs. If left untreated, proliferative retinopathy can cause severe vision loss and even blindness. Also, the earlier you receive treatment, the more likely treatment will be successful. Detection Diabetic retinopathy and macular edema are detected during a comprehensive eye exam that includes a visual acuity test, dilated eye exam, and tonometry. A visual acuity test is an eye chart test that measures how well you see at various distances. During the dilated eye exam, your eye care professional checks your retina for early signs of the disease, including - leaking blood vessels - retinal swelling such as macular edema - pale, fatty deposits on the retina -- signs of leaking blood vessels - damaged nerve tissue leaking blood vessels retinal swelling such as macular edema pale, fatty deposits on the retina -- signs of leaking blood vessels damaged nerve tissue Watch an animation showing what a comprehensive dilated eye exam involves. With tonometry, an instrument measures the pressure inside the eye. Numbing drops may be applied to your eye for this test. If your eye care professional believes you need treatment for macular edema, he or she may suggest a fluorescein angiogram. In this test, a special dye is injected into your arm. Pictures are taken as the dye passes through the blood vessels in your retina. The test allows your eye care professional to identify any leaking blood vessels and recommend treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"Preventing Disease Progression During the first three stages of diabetic retinopathy, no treatment is needed, unless you have macular edema. To prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy, people with diabetes should control their levels of blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. Treatment for Macular Edema Research found that that prompt treatment of macular edema with anti-VEGF drugs, with or without laser treatment, resulted in better vision than laser treatment alone or steroid injections. When injected into the eye, these drugs reduce fluid leakage and interfere with the growth of new blood vessels in the retina. In some cases, focal laser treatment is used along with the eye injections. Your doctor places up to several hundred small laser burns in the areas of the retina around the macula that are leaking. These burns slow the leakage of fluid and reduce the amount of fluid in the retina. The surgery is usually completed in one session. Further treatment may be needed. Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Proliferative retinopathy is treated with laser surgery. This procedure is called scatter laser treatment. Scatter laser treatment helps to shrink the abnormal blood vessels. Your doctor places 1,000 to 2,000 laser burns in the areas of the retina away from the macula, causing the abnormal blood vessels to shrink. Because a high number of laser burns are necessary, two or more sessions usually are required to complete treatment. Although you may notice some loss of your side vision, scatter laser treatment can save the rest of your sight. Scatter laser treatment may slightly reduce your color vision and night vision. Scatter laser treatment works better before the fragile, new blood vessels have started to bleed. That is why it is important to have regular, comprehensive dilated eye exams. Even if bleeding has started, scatter laser treatment may still be possible, depending on the amount of bleeding. Learn more about laser treatment. Vitrectomy If the bleeding is severe, you may need a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy. During a vitrectomy, blood is removed from the center of your eye. Scatter laser treatment and vitrectomy are effective in treating proliferative retinopathy and in reducing vision loss. Once you have proliferative retinopathy, you always will be at risk for new bleeding. You may need treatment more than once to protect your sight. Learn more about a vitrectomy.

This research is conducted through studies in the laboratory and with patients. For example, researchers are studying drugs for the treatment of proliferative retinopathy that may reduce the need for laser surgery. A major study has shown that better control of blood sugar levels slows the onset and progression of retinopathy. The people with diabetes who kept their blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible also had much less kidney and nerve disease.

They grow along the retina and along the surface of the clear, vitreous gel that fills the inside of the eye."},{"instruction":"Who is at risk for Diabetic Retinopathy? ?","output":"All people with diabetes -- both type 1 and type 2 -- are at risk for diabetic retinopathy. People with diabetes are also at increased risk for cataract and glaucoma. That's why everyone with diabetes should get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Between 40 to 45 percent of Americans diagnosed with diabetes have some stage of diabetic retinopathy. If you have diabetic retinopathy, your doctor can recommend treatment to help prevent its progression. See how to find an eye care professional."},{"instruction":"What causes Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"Blood vessels damaged from diabetic retinopathy can cause vision loss in two ways. Fragile, abnormal blood vessels can develop and leak blood into the center of the eye, blurring vision. This is proliferative retinopathy and is the fourth and most advanced stage of the disease. Fluid can leak into the center of the macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs. The fluid makes the macula swell, blurring vision. This condition is called macular edema. It can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, although it is more likely to occur as the disease progresses. About half of the people with proliferative retinopathy also have macular edema."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Don't wait for symptoms. Be sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Learn more about a comprehensive dilated eye exam."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"At first, you will see a few specks of blood, or spots, \\"floating\\" in your vision. If spots occur, see your eye care professional as soon as possible. You may need treatment before more serious bleeding or hemorrhaging occurs. Hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep. Sometimes, the spots clear without treatment, and you will see better. However, bleeding can reoccur and cause severely blurred vision. You need to be examined by your eye care professional at the first sign of blurred vision, before more bleeding occurs. If left untreated, proliferative retinopathy can cause severe vision loss and even blindness. Also, the earlier you receive treatment, the more likely treatment will be effective."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"In this test, a special dye is injected into your arm. Pictures are taken as the dye passes through the blood vessels in your retina. The test allows your eye care professional to identify any leaking blood vessels and recommend treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"Research found that that prompt treatment of macular edema with anti-VEGF drugs, with or without laser treatment, resulted in better vision than laser treatment alone or steroid injections. When injected into the eye, these drugs reduce fluid leakage and interfere with the growth of new blood vessels in the retina. In some cases, focal laser treatment is used along with the eye injections. Your doctor places up to several hundred small laser burns in the areas of the retina around the macula that are leaking. These burns slow the leakage of fluid and reduce the amount of fluid in the retina. The surgery is usually completed in one session. Further treatment may be needed."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"During the first three stages of diabetic retinopathy, no treatment is needed, unless you have macular edema. To prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy, people with diabetes should control their levels of blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. Proliferative retinopathy is treated with laser surgery. This procedure is called scatter laser treatment. Scatter laser treatment helps to shrink the abnormal blood vessels. Your doctor places 1,000 to 2,000 laser burns in the areas of the retina away from the macula, causing the abnormal blood vessels to shrink. Because a high number of laser burns are necessary, two or more sessions usually are required to complete treatment. Although you may notice some loss of your side vision, scatter laser treatment can save the rest of your sight. Scatter laser treatment may slightly reduce your color vision and night vision. If the bleeding is severe, you may need a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy. During a vitrectomy, blood is removed from the center of your eye."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"Both focal and scatter laser treatment are performed in your doctor's office or eye clinic. Before the surgery, your doctor will dilate your pupil and apply drops to numb the eye. The area behind your eye also may be numbed to prevent discomfort. The lights in the office will be dim. As you sit facing the laser machine, your doctor will hold a special lens to your eye. During the procedure, you may see flashes of light. These flashes eventually may create a stinging sensation that can be uncomfortable. You will need someone to drive you home after surgery. Because your pupil will remain dilated for a few hours, you should bring a pair of sunglasses. For the rest of the day, your vision will probably be a little blurry. If your eye hurts, your doctor can suggest treatment."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"If you have a lot of blood in the center of the eye, or vitreous gel, you may need a vitrectomy to restore your sight. If you need vitrectomies in both eyes, they are usually done several weeks apart. A vitrectomy is performed under either local or general anesthesia. Your doctor makes a tiny incision in your eye. Next, a small instrument is used to remove the vitreous gel that is clouded with blood. The vitreous gel is replaced with a salt solution. Because the vitreous gel is mostly water, you will notice no change between the salt solution and the original vitreous gel."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"Yes. Both treatments are very effective in reducing vision loss. People with proliferative retinopathy can reduce their risk of blindness by 95 percent with timely treatment and appropriate follow-up care. Although both treatments have high success rates, they do not cure diabetic retinopathy. Once you have proliferative retinopathy, you always will be at risk for new bleeding. You may need treatment more than once to protect your sight."},{"instruction":"what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"The National Eye Institute, or NEI, is conducting and supporting research that seeks better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with diabetes. This research is conducted through studies in the laboratory and with patients. For example, researchers are studying drugs for the treatment of proliferative retinopathy that may reduce the need for laser surgery."},{"instruction":"What to do for Diabetic Retinopathy ?","output":"If you have diabetes, get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Proliferative retinopathy can develop without symptoms. If it gets to this advanced stage, you are at high risk for vision loss or even blindness. Macular edema can develop without symptoms at any of the four stages of diabetic retinopathy. You can develop both proliferative retinopathy and macular edema and still see fine.

That is why prevention is key. However, there are many different reasons why people abuse drugs and become addicted to them. These reasons need to be taken into account when considering how to best prevent drug abuse. Family members, friends, pharmacists, and health care providers can all be involved in preventing drug abuse among older adults. Preventing Medication Abuse There are steps that you as a patient can take to prevent abuse of prescription medications and its consequences. - When visiting the doctor or pharmacist, bring along all prescription and over-the-counter medicines that you take -- or a list of the medicines and their dosages (how much you take and how often). Your doctor can make sure your medicines are right for you and make changes if necessary. - Always follow medication directions carefully. - Only use the medication for its prescribed purpose. - Do not crush or break pills. - If you are not sure how to take a medicine correctly, ask your doctor or pharmacist. He or she can tell you how to take a medication properly and about side effects to watch out for and interactions with other medications. - Ask how the medication will affect driving and other daily activities. - Do not use other people's prescription medications, and do not share yours. - Talk with your doctor before increasing or decreasing the medication dosage.

For people of all ages, an individuals biology (including their genetics) and the environment, as well as how the two act together, determine a persons vulnerability to drug abuse and addiction -- or can protect against it. For example, being exposed to drugs of abuse in youth, living in a community where drug use is prevalent, having untreated mental disorders, such as depression, or dealing with difficult transition periods such as retirement or loss of a spouse can all make an older adult more vulnerable to drug abuse. Prevention Requires Various Approaches Prevention efforts must focus on gaining a better understanding of the factors that promote illicit drug use in older adults. Prevention also includes finding ways to stop drug use before it worsens and leads to health problems, including addiction. Family members can play an important role by being aware of an older relatives well-being and possible drug abuse, and stepping in to help at an early stage, if necessary. Doctors should ask their older patients about potential drug abuse and make referrals as needed."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?","output":"Addiction is a chronic disease in which a person craves, seeks, and continues to abuse a legal (medication, alcohol, tobacco) or an illicit (illegal) drug, despite harmful consequences. People who are addicted continue to abuse the substance even though it can harm their physical or mental health, lead to accidents, or put others in danger. For more on drugs and the brain, see Drugs, Brains and Behavior: The Science of Addiction."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?","output":"Physical dependence is a normal process that can happen to anyone taking a medication for a long time. It means that the body (including the brain) is adapting to the presence of the drug, and the person may require a higher dosage or a different medication to get relief; this condition is known as tolerance. They may also suffer from withdrawal or feel sick when they stop taking the medication abruptly. However, the symptoms of withdrawal can usually be prevented or managed by a physician, which is why it is so important to talk to a doctor before stopping a medication. Someone who is addicted to a drug may also be physically dependent on it, but rather than benefitting from the drugs effects, an addicted person will continue to get worse with continued or increasing drug abuse. An addicted person compulsively seeks and abuses drugs, despite their negative consequences."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?","output":"A persons behavior, especially changes in behavior, can signal a possible substance abuse problem. For example, you may notice that an older adult seems worried about whether a medicine is really working, or complains that a doctor refuses to write a prescription. He or she may have new problems doing everyday tasks or withdraw from family, friends, and normal activities. Other possible warning signs include - rapid increases in the amount of medication needed - frequent requests for refills of certain medicines - a person not seeming like themselves (showing a general lack of interest or being overly energetic) - \\"doctor shopping\\" -- moving from provider to provider in an effort to get several prescriptions for the same medication - use of more than one pharmacy - false or forged prescriptions. rapid increases in the amount of medication needed frequent requests for refills of certain medicines a person not seeming like themselves (showing a general lack of interest or being overly energetic) \\"doctor shopping\\" -- moving from provider to provider in an effort to get several prescriptions for the same medication use of more than one pharmacy false or forged prescriptions."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?","output":"The prescription medications most commonly abused by people of any age are opioids (painkillers), depressants, and stimulants.

Currently, medications are available to treat addiction to opiates, nicotine, and alcohol, but none are yet approved for treating addiction to stimulants, marijuana, or depressants. Medications for substance abuse treatment help the brain adjust to the absence of the abused substance. These medications act slowly to stave off drug cravings and prevent relapse. For example, buprenorphine, marketed as Subutex or Suboxone, is prescribed by approved physicians to treat people who are addicted to opiate drugs, such as painkillers or heroin. Buprenorphine is useful in the short-term detoxification process by helping ease withdrawal symptoms and in the long-term by staving off cravings and helping prevent relapse.

You may also have heard COPD called other names, like emphysema or chronic bronchitis. In people who have COPD, the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs are partially blocked, making it difficult to get air in and out. COPD is a major cause of death and illness throughout the world. It kills more than 120,000 Americans each year. That's one death every 4 minutes. How COPD Affects Airways The \\"airways\\" are the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs through the nose and mouth. The airways of the lungs branch out like an upside-down tree. At the end of each branch are many small, balloon-like air sacs. In healthy people, the airways and air sacs are elastic (stretchy). When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon, and when you breathe out, the balloon deflates and the air goes out. In people with COPD, the airways and air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. Less air gets in and less air goes out of the airways because - The airways and air sacs lose their elasticity like an old rubber band. - The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. - The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or swollen. - Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways.

Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways. COPD Develops Slowly, Has No Cure When COPD is severe, shortness of breath and other symptoms of COPD can get in the way of even the most basic tasks, such as doing light housework, taking a walk, even washing and dressing. COPD develops slowly, and it may be many years before you notice symptoms like feeling short of breath. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older people. There is no cure for COPD. The damage to your airways and lungs cannot be reversed, but there are things you can do to control the disabling effects of the disease. COPD is not contagious. You cannot catch it from someone else."},{"instruction":"What causes COPD ?","output":"Smoking Most cases of COPD develop over time, from breathing in fumes and other things that irritate the lungs. Some of the things that put you at risk for COPD include smoking, environmental exposure, and genetic factors. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD in the United States (either current or former smokers). Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking can also cause COPD, especially if the smoke is inhaled. Environmental Exposure COPD can also occur in people who have had long-term exposure to things that can irritate your lungs, like chemical fumes, or dust from the environment or workplace. Heavy or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke or other air pollutants may also contribute to COPD even if you have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. Secondhand smoke is smoke in the air from other people smoking. Genetic Factors In a small number of people, COPD is caused by a genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT, deficiency. People who have this condition have low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)a protein made in the liver. Having a low level of the AAT protein can lead to lung damage and COPD if you're exposed to smoke or other lung irritants. If you have this condition and smoke, COPD can worsen very quickly. While very few people know if they have AAT deficiency, it is estimated that about 1 in every 1,600 people to about 1 in every 5,000 people have it. People with AAT deficiency can get COPD even if they have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. Asthma Although uncommon, some people who have asthma can develop COPD. Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Treatment usually can reverse the inflammation and narrowing. However, if not, COPD can develop."},{"instruction":"w to prevent COPD ?","output":"If you have COPD, you can take these steps to prevent complications and control the disabling effects of the disease. - Quit smoking. - Avoid exposure to pollutants and lung irritants. - Take precautions against the flu. - Talk to your doctor about the flu and pneumonia vaccines. - See your doctor on a regular basis. - Follow your treatments for COPD exactly as your doctor prescribes. Quit smoking. Avoid exposure to pollutants and lung irritants. Take precautions against the flu. Talk to your doctor about the flu and pneumonia vaccines. See your doctor on a regular basis. Follow your treatments for COPD exactly as your doctor prescribes. Quit Smoking If you smoke, the most important thing you can do to prevent more lung damage is to stop smoking. Quitting can help prevent complications and slow the progress of the disease. It is also important to stay away from people who smoke and places where you know there will be smokers. To help you quit, there are many online resources and several new aids available from your doctor or health care provider. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has information on smoking cessation. Visit SmokeFree.gov , or check out NCI's Clear Horizons, a quit smoking guide for people 50+. You can also visit The American Lung Association, or call 1-800-QUIT NOW (1-800-784-8669). Avoid Exposure to Pollutants and Lung Irritants Try to stay away from other things that could irritate your lungs, like dust and strong fumes. Stay indoors when the outside air quality is poor. You should also stay away from places where there might be cigarette smoke. Take Precautions Against the Flu The flu (influenza) can cause serious problems for people who have COPD. Do your best to avoid crowds during flu season. In addition to avoiding people with the flu, remembering to wash and sanitize your hands can be one of the best ways to guard against getting sick. Talk to Your Doctor About the Flu (influenza) and Pneumonia Vaccines Talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and whether and when you should get the pneumonia vaccine. Flu shots can reduce your risk of getting the flu, and the pneumonia vaccine lowers your risk for pneumococcal pneumonia (NU-mo-KOK-al nu-MO-ne-ah) and its complications. Both of these illnesses are major health risks for people who have COPD. See Your Doctor Regularly See your doctor or health care provider regularly even if you are feeling fine. Make a list of your breathing symptoms and think about any activities that you can no longer do because of shortness of breath. Be sure to bring a list of all the medicines you are taking to each office visit. Follow Your Treatments Follow your treatments for COPD exactly as your doctor prescribes.

Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. If your doctor thinks you may have COPD, he or she will examine you, listen to your lungs, and ask you questions about your medical history, and what lung irritants you may have been around for long periods of time. The Spirometry Test To confirm a diagnosis of COPD, your doctor will use a breathing test called spirometry. The test is easy and painless and shows how much air you can breathe out and measures how fast you can breathe it out. In a spirometry test, you breathe hard into a large hose connected to a machine called a spirometer. When you breathe out, the spirometer measures how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. Spirometry can detect COPD before symptoms develop. Your doctor also might use the test results to find out how severe your COPD is and to help set your treatment goals. The test results also may help find out whether another condition, such as asthma or heart failure, is causing your symptoms. Determining COPD Severity Based on this test, your doctor can determine if you have COPD and how severe it is. There are four levels of severity for COPD: - people at risk for COPD - people with mild COPD - people with moderate COPD - people with severe COPD. people at risk for COPD people with mild COPD people with moderate COPD people with severe COPD. People at risk for developing COPD have a normal breathing test and mild symptoms such as chronic cough and sputum (mucus) production. People with mild COPD have mild breathing limitation. Symptoms may include a chronic cough and sputum (mucus) production. At this stage, you may not be aware that airflow in your lungs is reduced. People with moderate COPD have a breathing test that shows worsening airflow blockages. Symptoms may be worse than with mild COPD and you may experience shortness of breath while working hard, walking fast, or doing brisk activity. At this stage, you would seek medical attention. People with severe COPD have a breathing test that shows severe limitation of the airflow. People with severe COPD will be short of breath after just a little activity. In very severe COPD, complications like respiratory failure or signs of heart failure may develop. At this stage, quality of life is impaired and worsening symptoms may be life-threatening. Other Tests Other tests are used to rule out other causes of the symptoms. - Bronchodilator reversibility testing uses the spirometer and medications called bronchodilators to assess whether breathing problems may be caused by asthma. Bronchodilator reversibility testing uses the spirometer and medications called bronchodilators to assess whether breathing problems may be caused by asthma. - A chest X-ray or a chest CT scan may also be ordered by your doctor.

Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking can cause COPD, especially if the smoke is inhaled. Exposure to secondhand smoke can play a role in causing COPD. Most people with COPD are at least 40 years old or around middle age when symptoms start."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of COPD ?","output":"The most common symptoms of COPD are a cough that does not go away and coughing up a lot of sputum (mucus). These symptoms may occur years before lung damage has reduced the flow of air in and out of the lungs. Other symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, especially with exercise; wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe); and tightness in the chest."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose COPD ?","output":"To confirm a COPD diagnosis, a doctor will use a breathing test called spirometry. The test is easy and painless. It shows how well the lungs are working. The spirometer measures how much air the lungs can hold and how fast air is blown out of the lungs. Other tests, such as bronchodilator reversibility testing, a chest X-ray, and arterial blood gas test, may be ordered."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for COPD ?","output":"Treatment for COPD can be different for each person and is based on whether symptoms are mild, moderate or severe. Treatments include medication, pulmonary or lung rehabilitation, oxygen treatment, and surgery. There are also treatments to manage complications or a sudden onset of symptoms."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose COPD ?","output":"If you have not been exercising regularly, you should get the advice of your doctor before starting. The symptoms of COPD are different for each person. People with mild COPD may not have much difficulty walking or exercising. As the symptoms of COPD get worse over time, a person may have more difficulty with walking and exercising. You should talk to your doctor about exercising and whether you would benefit from a pulmonary or lung rehabilitation program."},{"instruction":"w to prevent COPD ?","output":"If you smoke, the most important thing you can do to prevent more lung damage is to stop smoking. It is also important to stay away from people who smoke and places where you know there will be smokers. Avoid exposure to pollutants like dust, fumes, and poor air quality, and take precautions to prevent flu and pneumonia. Following your doctor's instructions with medications and rehabilitative treatment can help alleviate COPD symptoms and control the disabling effects of the disease."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for COPD ?","output":"Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids are two medications used to treat COPD. Bronchodilators work by relaxing the muscles around the airways, opening them and making it easier to breathe. People with mild COPD take bronchodilators using an inhaler only when needed. Those with moderate or severe COPD may need more regular treatment. Inhaled steroids also are used for people with moderate or severe COPD in order to reduce swelling in the airways."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of COPD ?","output":"Call your doctor right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. People with COPD may have symptoms that suddenly get worse. When this happens, you have a much harder time catching your breath. Symptoms that worsen suddenly can include sudden chest tightness, more coughing, a change in your sputum (mucus), or fever. Your doctor will look at things that may be causing these sudden symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms are caused by a lung infection."},{"instruction":"What is (are) COPD ?","output":"More information on COPD is available at: What is COPD? and at the Learn More, Breathe Better Campaign For information on quitting smoking, visit http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco/ or Smokefree.gov.

Everyone has dry mouth once in a while -- if they are nervous, upset, under stress, or taking certain medications. But if you have dry mouth all or most of the time, see a dentist or physician. Many older adults have dry mouth, but it is not a normal part of aging. (Watch the video to learn more about dry mouth. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Why Saliva is Important Saliva does more than keep your mouth wet. It protects teeth from decay, helps heal sores in your mouth, and prevents infection by controlling bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the mouth. Saliva helps digest food and helps us chew and swallow. Saliva is involved in taste perception as well. Each of these functions of saliva is hampered when a person has dry mouth. How Dry Mouth Feels Dry mouth can be uncomfortable. Some people notice a sticky, dry feeling in the mouth. Others notice a burning feeling or difficulty while eating. The throat may feel dry, too, making swallowing difficult and choking common. Also, people with dry mouth may get mouth sores, cracked lips, and a dry, rough tongue."},{"instruction":"What causes Dry Mouth ?","output":"People get dry mouth when the glands in the mouth that make saliva are not working properly. Because of this, there might not be enough saliva to keep your mouth healthy. There are several reasons why these glands, called salivary glands, might not work right. Medicines and Dry Mouth More than 400 medicines, including some over-the-counter medications, can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva, or to change the composition of the saliva so that it can't perform the functions it should. As an example, medicines for urinary incontinence, allergies, high blood pressure, and depression often cause dry mouth. Diseases That Can Cause Dry Mouth Some diseases can affect the salivary glands. Dry mouth can occur in patients with diabetes. Dry mouth is also the hallmark symptom of the fairly common autoimmune disease Sjgren's syndrome. Sjgren's syndrome can occur either by itself or with another autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Salivary and tear glands are the major targets of the syndrome and the result is a decrease in production of saliva and tears. The disorder can occur at any age, but the average person with the disorder at the Sjgren's Syndrome Clinic of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) is in his or her late 50s. Women with the disorder outnumber men 9 to 1. Cancer Treatments and Dry Mouth Certain cancer treatments can affect the salivary glands. Head and neck radiation therapy can cause the glands to produce little or no saliva. Chemotherapy may cause the salivary glands to produce thicker saliva, which makes the mouth feel dry and sticky. Injury to the head or neck can damage the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Dry Mouth ?","output":"Treatment for Dry Mouth Dry mouth treatment will depend on what is causing the problem. If you think you have dry mouth, see your dentist or physician. He or she can help to determine what is causing your dry mouth. If your dry mouth is caused by medicine, your physician might change your medicine or adjust the dosage. If your salivary glands are not working right but can still produce some saliva, your dentist or physician might give you a medicine that helps the glands work better. Your dentist or physician might also suggest that you use artificial saliva to keep your mouth wet. Do's and Don'ts Do's - Do drink water or sugarless drinks often. That will make chewing and swallowing easier when eating. - Do chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow. - Do use a humidifier at night to promote moisture in the air while you sleep.

Don't use tobacco or alcohol. They dry out the mouth. Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIHs National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjgren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCRs news release to learn more about the studys findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjgrens Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogrens syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions. To stay abreast of any new studies on gene therapy and salivary gland function, visit ClinicalTrials.gov. ClinicalTrials.gov lists all federally and many privately funded clinical trials in the U.S. and around the world; the web site is updated frequently."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Dry Mouth ?","output":"Dry mouth is the condition of not having enough saliva, or spit, to keep your mouth wet.

The final \\"Dm\\" chord is held through what would typically be one full measure. This brings to a close the progression for the outro. Since we are assuming an uncomplicated rhythmic pattern here, note that in the actual piece, the rhythm and placement of chord changes might be different.

Born to parents who had long since given up on the dream of a child, her arrival was met with ambivalence; as she was perceived to be marked with a peculiar destiny in her eyes, ones that held a fathomless depth not unlike the night sky. The villagers kept a respectful distance from Mariska, treating her with a mixture of reverence and trepidation. She was of them, yet not; a girl whose limbs seemed to whisper the secrets of a faraway world with each graceful movement. They murmured that she was the offspring of a pact with the mystical forces that governed their fates, a living testament to the blurred lines between human and the arcane forces that toyed with mortal lives. As she grew, her parents observed subtle transformations not just in her physique but in her essence. It was during those twilight hours, when the sky melted into a palette of dusky violets and soft oranges, that her parents would find her conversing with shadows cast by nothing, speaking a language that brushed against the ears like the rustling of leaves. \\"Mariska,\\" her mother would scold gently, a wreathe of worry framing her features, \\"Remember who you are, and to whom you belong.\\" But Mariska’s essence was elusive, as if a part of her spirit danced perpetually in another realm, her fate intertwined with mysteries as confounding as the labyrinthine forests that bordered their home. The villagers whispered of prophecies whispered on the winds, of a girl fated to dissolve and rematerialize in forms no living eyes had ever beheld. The tendrils of Mariska’s story wove themselves around the heart of Ivor, a boy of the village who watched her with a longing that outstripped the boundaries of their shared reality. It was Ivor who noticed the shifts in Mariska's comportment, the way her shadow sometimes fluttered independent of its source, the way she sometimes paused in her step, her gaze penetrating the veil to something unseen and unfathomable. Ivor, in a quiet defiance of the unspoken village decree, began to inch closer to Mariska’s orbit, drawn by an internal force he could neither name nor resist. His heart, like a lodestone, was fixed on the enigma that was Mariska. And as they slowly entwined, a narrative awaited them, laced with greater intricacy than the finely spun tales of the weaver birds nesting in the canopy above. Yet, under the burden of an evening sky that held the promise of revelations, Ivor could not shake the sense of foreboding laced within Mariska’s enigmatic smiles and cryptic utterances. There was a secret nestled deep within her being that beckoned him with both beauty and dread."},{"instruction":"","output":"Ivor began to dream of labyrinths – not the kind made of stone and vine as in the old tales, but rather paths outlined by the interweaving lines of fate and chance. In his slumber, he wandered endless corridors that echoed with a haunting melody, the song of Mariska's whispered language. It was a melody that seemed to both call him deeper into the maze and caution him against its center, where the unknown thrummed with the potency of a storm waiting to break. When he awoke, his mind was alight with the persistent notion that Mariska was the labyrinth itself; a living, breathing enigma that one could explore but perhaps never truly understand or escape. Ivor knew that to love Mariska was to entangle himself in the spirals of her mystery, where each revelation might only herald greater puzzles. As the days unfurled like the wings of the exotic butterflies that occasionally flitted through the village – admired but forever beyond grasp – Ivor found moments to walk with Mariska. They traced the borders of their world, toes skirting the edge of the shadows cast by the ancient trees, as if toying with the thresholds of other realms. \\"What are you looking for, Mariska?\\" Ivor once dared to ask, his voice tentative as if afraid to unravel the very mystery he was compelled to solve. Mariska turned to him, her gaze holding the memory of stardust and unspoken history. \\"I am in search of the same thing that seeks us all,\\" she replied, her words carrying the weight of a prophecy or a riddle. \\"Understanding, transformation, becoming... perhaps I too am merely a character in search of my place within the grand narrative.\\" Her fingers brushed against the contours of a rough-barked tree, its ancient skin a chronicle of years beyond count. Ivor watched the shadows play around her, feeling both near to the core of her essence and hopelessly distant. In her presence, he could sense the dense fog of inevitability that clung to her, a destiny that whispered of great and irrevocable change. One afternoon, as they rested in the shade of a gnarled oak, a strange stillness enveloped the pair. Mariska's eyes fluttered shut, and her breath became a soft cadence that seemed to harmonize with the rhythm of the earth. It was then that Ivor witnessed the most profound of her transformations, one never before seen by mortal eyes. She unfolded, not in body but in being, her essence shimmering like a mirage. She became translucent, a spirit draped in the gossamer threads of twilight. Before Ivor's astonished eyes, she expanded, her form dissipating to intertwine with the elements around them – the air, the soil, the whispering leaves. Overwhelmed with awe and an edge of fear, Ivor reached out – not to touch Mariska, for she was everywhere and nowhere all at once – but to somehow affirm his own reality in the face of such an impossible marvel. As he did so, the world snapped back into focus, and Mariska returned to her human shape, as if she had never left it. Neither spoke of the transformation, words powerless against the magnitude of what had transpired. Yet, Ivor had crossed a threshold of understanding: Mariska held within her a magic that was both a gift and a burden, a source of wonder and a harbinger of trials yet to endure. As night fell and the two walked back to the village – a place increasingly alien to Mariska – Ivor grappled with his role in her story, unknowingly inching ever closer to the heart of the labyrinth."},{"instruction":"","output":"The tale of Mariska, ever-unfolding, unforgiving in its complexity, became the stuff of fevered whispers around village fires. Ivor, now held in the thrall of her inexplicable alterations, grappled with his own transformation: from an idle spectator to a steadfast sentinel on the perimeter of a saga both fearsome and alluring. In the world beyond their village – a world Mariska seemed as connected to as she was detached from – the skies whispered of change. Elders spoke of celestial portents, of stars aligning in patterns unrecorded by history, and of a great turning that was upon them. What role Mariska, whom many had begun to call the Daughter of Constellations, would play in this drama, was at once a question too fearful to ask and too urgent to ignore. Ivor, with the saturnine knowledge of Mariska's otherness weighing heavy on his chest, sensed the burgeoning responsibility within himself to protect her. Yet, he wondered, who could shield the wind, guide the river, or fence the wandering light of evening stars? It was a conundrum that tethered Ivor to Mariska irrevocably, binding him to a destiny neither fully understood. Their walks became fraught with an electric tension, each step an act of defiance against the forces that sought to claim Mariska. In these moments, Ivor saw not the specters of mythical creatures or the shadows of old gods in their sacred grove, but rather the reflection of a question that echoed in his own heart: could love act as a compass in a narrative dictated by powers unseen? It was during an eclipse, when the sun surrendered to the moon's embrace, that Mariska spoke of her dreams – not of labyrinths of stone or fate – but of water. \\"Beneath the surface,\\" she murmured, the air around her quivering with the energy of her revelations, \\"where light bends and truth drowns, I am there, and I am something else entirely.\\" \\"The water,\\" Ivor pondered, his thoughts swimming to the surface. \\"Is it another maze for us to navigate?\\" \\"Perhaps,\\" Mariska agreed, her eyes reflecting the uncanny darkness that had washed over their world. \\"Or perhaps it is the place where all mazes converge, where all that is fragmented finds harmony.\\" Ivor's heartbeats were a drumbeat pacing the moments until the sun emerged once more, fierce and declaring its reign over the sky. In that rekindled light, he saw the myth of Mariska anew – not as chains of predestination, but as a tapestry of potential woven by hands unseen. Their bond deepened, became something venerated and unspoken. It was like the untracked path through a wood, or the undercurrent of a stream: always present, yet eluding the grasp of those who sought to chart its course. Ivor understood then, that his quest was not to unravel Mariska, nor to tether her to a realm too narrow for her spirit. His quest was to accompany her, to share in the wonder and terror that her journey entailed, and to offer his presence as a beacon in whatever passages – be they of water or of some transformative ether – she might traverse. As they returned to the ever-changing face of their village, it seemed to Ivor that the world itself was reshaping, the lines between myth and reality ever more blurred, humming with the resonance of Mariska's evanescent melody. Each heart in the village, whether they recognized it or not, beat in rhythm to the unfolding narrative – a melody at once haunting and beautiful – a little nothing that held everything within."},{"instruction":"","output":"Days blended into nights with the imperceptible grace of shadows stretching toward twilight, the nuances of the villagers' lives echoing the enigmatic pulse of Mariska's existence. The Daughter of Constellations had become the unseen axis upon which their world turned, the measure of their fears and fascinations. Ivor, whose soul had become attuned to the rhythm of her breaths, watched as the seasons greeted Mariska with a nod of acknowledgment, as if she were an old friend, a confidante privy to the earth's most guarded secrets. Through his eyes, the villagers glimpsed the awe of this connection, though none dared to tread too closely to the mystery that unfolded between human and the beat of the world. As autumnal hues painted the village in tones of fire and gold, Mariska found herself drawn to the edge of the wood where a pond lay hidden, a mirror to the sky and a whisper to the depths. It was here, Ivor noticed, that her dreams of water seemed to coalesce into intent, her gaze piercing the surface as if seeking communion with the soul beneath. Ivor stood sentinel, providing silent companionship, as Mariska knelt by the water's edge. She extended her slender fingers toward the liquid expanse, touching the reflection of a lone cloud that dared voyage across the pond's still face. With her touch, the water rippled, distorting the world above, creating a chasm of light and shadow. \\"The water,\\" she whispered, her eyes reflecting the turmoil of the ripples, \\"it's not a maze, but a gateway, the place of becoming and unbecoming – the veil is thinnest here.\\" Ivor felt a tremor of destiny unfurl between them. Mariska was not merely observing the water; she was beckoning something ancient and profound from its depths. The pond, once a silent repository of fallen leaves and the occasional errant stone, began to pulse with a rhythm that echoed the heartbeats of all who drew near. An incandescent glow emerged from the deep, cradling Mariska's reflection as if to merge essence with image. There was no great fanfare, no tempest of magic and might – only the placid revelation that realms beyond their own brushed fingertips with the quiet world of the villagers. Mariska, entranced, reached further, her entire being leaning into the threshold. Ivor, heart clenched with terror and wonder, reached out to anchor her to the here and now. But before their hands met, she turned to him with a seraphic tranquility. \\"Do not fear,\\" she soothed, her voice a lullaby to the thrashing soul. \\"This is but a passage, a crossing over into the melody that has always been – a dissonance in search of harmony.\\" In that moment, her words became the loom upon which Ivor wove his understanding; Mariska was not to be protected from her fate but rather accompanied with reverence and courage as she explored the deep and vast verses of her story. Together, they would unfurl the threads, entwining their narratives in a duet that transcended the measures of mere song and discourse. As the glow enveloped Mariska, she offered Ivor an ethereal smile, her body slowly submerging into the water's embrace. Ivor, heart steadfast, watched as she dissolved into the light, her form scattering into countless reflections of herself, each a nuance of the enigma that was her essence. The pond stilled once more, the gateway closing gently, leaving behind the softly murmuring world and a young man whose eyes now held depths rivaling the very waters that embraced his love. Ivor, alone but not bereft, understood that Mariska's transformation was not an ending but an overture to the profound symphony of their intertwined legends. The villagers, beholding the change in Ivor, whispered among themselves that fate had carved into their midst a story of such magnitude that its echoes would resonate through their lives and beyond. As Ivor walked among them, his gaze lingering upon places where Mariska had walked, spoken, and changed, they understood that the lines between myth and reality were merely brushstrokes on the canvas of their world, an ever-expanding tableau of wonder and mystery. The novelistic tones of \\"Little Nothing\\" swirled around them, their narrative arcs bending toward an ever-elusive horizon where the next chapter waited, patient and undiscovered."},{"instruction":"","output":"Mariska, who had been a tempest, was now silent as the deep. Her absence was a hollow that resonated through Ivor's every step, her presence as palpable as the chill of dawn's first breath. Yet in the silence left by her voyage, stories began to sprout like wildflowers in untended fields. Tales of a woman who could become water, who could commune with the spirits of the deep, who was both lost to the known world and profoundly present in the constant cycle of ebb and flow. In the days that followed, the villagers approached Ivor with a newfound reverence, as if through his shared journey with Mariska, he had attained a wisdom that far exceeded the boundaries of their simple lives. He became a figure of myth interwoven with flesh, a touchstone for all those who sought to understand the mysteries Mariska had embodied. Ivor, for his part, found himself wandering the paths of their village and the edges of the woods, as if he could somehow trace Mariska's steps into understanding. He became a guardian of the tales, ensuring that with each telling, Mariska's story was imbued with the wonder and respect it deserved – a beacon in the dark for all seekers of truth. The eclipse that had marked the beginning of Mariska's passage now became a symbol within the village, a moment when one world kissed another, when the veil was lifted, and transformation was not only possible but inevitable. Yet Ivor yearned for more than memories and symbols. Each night, he would return to the pond, now sacred to those who knew of its hidden doorway. There, beneath the canvas of stars, Ivor would speak to Mariska, his words simple whispers that danced upon the water's surface, hoping they would sink into the depths and find her. \\"Mariska, you are the little nothing that holds everything,\\" he would say, his heart aching with the beauty of their shared moments. \\"In your transformation, you have unfolded the universe, revealing that each small facet of existence is threaded with the infinite.\\" Time, unyielding in its march, wore pathways into the lives of the villagers. Seasons turned, painting the world in a spectrum of life and slumber, rebirth and stillness. Ivor felt the years in his bones, yet within him, the fire that Mariska had sparked – one of curiosity and unquenchable longing – continued to burn fiercely. One dusk, as the sun lowered its amber gaze to the horizon, Ivor noticed a disturbance upon the water. There, amidst the play of twilight upon the gentle undulations of the pond, a solitary water lily had surfaced – a flower that had never graced their waters before. It was a bloom of such radiant beauty, such pure form, that Ivor's breath caught in his throat. He approached and knelt by the water's edge, his heart thrumming an ancient rhythm. As his fingers grazed the lily's petals, he felt a connection, a gentle tug at the fabric of his being that wove through him thread by delicate thread. \\"Mariska?\\" he uttered, the name a prayer and a benediction. The water lily swayed, a dance that whispered of secrets and silent laughter, of journeys through realms untold, and of love that wove its unending tapestry beyond the confines of physical form. Ivor's eyes filled with tears of joy and recognition, for though the shape before him bore none of Mariska's features, the essence that caressed his soul was unmistakable. Here, in this singular, blooming lily, Mariska returned to him the melody of her existence – a little nothing that spoke of everything; of the continuous cycle of stories that shape and reshape the world, of the thin lines that bind myth to reality, and of the enduring, transformative power of love. In this continuous novelistic fold, the intertwined fates of Ivor and Mariska spiraled on, a testament to the eternal enigma of being and becoming."},{"instruction":"(try max tokens in length you can possibly achieve in a single response). continue.","output":"Ivor's life, forever entwined with the water lily that graced the liminal pond, evolved into a living allegory, etching into the village the enduring saga of Mariska's profound metamorphosis. His days became a testament to the shared love that defied the mundane grasp of form and substance, a hallowed echo resonating within the collective memory of the village, a mythopoetic narrative enshrined within the annals of the daily and the divine. The villagers, in reverence to Ivor's bond with the ethereal blossom that was thought to embody Mariska's spirit, began to imbue their own traditions with the vestiges of her myth. Every newborn was brought to the water’s edge, where the lily's silent benediction was sought, a silent plea for each child to find within themselves the courage to embrace the grandeur of their own unfolding story, however mysterious or arcane its passages may be. As the years wove their indelible patterns, the lily became a symbol of resilience and transformation, a sacred emblem of the village’s identity. Seasons turned, saplings grew into towering sentinels, and children blossomed into the keepers of tomorrow’s dreams, yet the water lily remained untouched by the passage of time, an eternal bloom upon the still surface of an ever-changing world. Ivor, now an elder, with silver threads lacing through his hair, would regale the young with vivid recollections of Mariska – the girl who became the wind and the whisper, the soul who could transmute flesh into water, and whose love he carried as an unwavering flame within his heart. He spoke of the nature of reality, a tapestry woven of both the palpable and the arcane, insisting on the presence of the miraculous veiled within the guise of the ordinary. \\"Beneath the surface of all things lies the capacity for wonder,\\" Ivor would say, his gaze alight with the fire of his unending quest. \\"Each petal of this lily, each ripple on this pond; they contain the universe in microcosm – the sacred dance of creation and dissolution, an echo of the harmony that binds all existence.\\" The children listened, their eyes alight with the luminescence of a dawn yet unclad by the horizon's embrace. They would touch the water gently, sending forth ripples in hopes of catching a glimpse of Mariska in the waltz of life beneath the waves. The elders, too, found solace by the pond – a return to the simplicity of belief, an affirmation that beyond the shroud of their knowing there thrummed a deeper, more profound mystery. The tale of Mariska, as relayed by Ivor, unfurled into an epic that transcended the mere recounting of events. In the telling, it became an odyssey of consciousness, an elegy to nascent wonder, a parable of love's undying reach. With each iteration, with each breath that carried the narrative, the boundaries between Mariska's world and the one they all inhabited grew fainter, until it seemed she was as much a part of them as the air they breathed and the ground they trod. In time, the water lily, both singular and extraordinary, spawned others. The pond, previously home to one, now cradled a brood of blossoms, each a separate note in the hymn of her memory. The villagers took this as a sign, as an affirmation that Mariska's spirit was still at work, weaving and reweaving the strands of the known into the fabric of new, unfathomable truths. Ivor, in the twilight of his years, felt the pull of transitioning, the inexorable call to join Mariska in the domain that lay beyond the fraught borders of tangible reality. There, in the quietude of his heart, where the thrumming of the world fell to a whisper, he heard her sing to him, enticing him to the water’s brink, where transformation awaited with the patience of the cosmos. \\"Dare to become,\\" her voice seemed to say, borne on the zephyr that danced across the twilight waters. \\"Dare to continue the journey that we began in the innocence of youth and the boldness of love. Here, in the little nothing, we find the everything—our story unending, a ballad of the soul sung across the vastness of existence.\\" And so, beneath a sky strewn with stars like dewdrops upon the web of the infinite, Ivor took his last, tender steps toward the edge of the pond. With heart open, he released his final breath to the wind, his essence joining the great and final transformation. What the villagers found come morning was not the visage of the man they had known, but a new water lily upon the surface, white as moonlight and serene as the silence that cradles the dawn. The pond, now a shrine and testament to the wonders it had beheld, cradled both Mariska's and Ivor's legacy within its watery bosom. Generation to generation would carry the tale of their transcendent love, an epic replete with marvels that blurred the lines between the real and the imagined, painting the mundane with the colors of myth, ensuring that as long as the water held the lilies and the sky held the stars, the story of “Little Nothing” would cascade through the ages—an ever-continuing chronicle of transformation, mystery, and the enduring tapestry of human connection."},{"instruction":"","output":"The legacy of Mariska and Ivor imbued the village with an air of the numinous, as if the very earth upon which they trod had been sanctified by their saga. Children played at the water's edge, weaving stories of their own, their laughter mingling with the rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of the pond. Elders sat in contemplative reverie, pondering the mysteries that had unfolded in their lifetime – of love that defied boundaries, of metamorphoses that spoke to the soul’s desire to reach beyond its grasp. The water lilies, guardians of the sacred pond, blossomed in profusion, their presence a reminder that the veil between the mundane and the mystical was but a breath, a sigh of the universe in its eternal dance. Over the years, as the white flowers multiplied, their petals became like pages upon which the villagers inscribed their hopes, their fears, and their own stories of transformation. It was this very pond that became the heart of the village, a nexus of communal life that drew people in for ceremonies and silent offerings. They believed that each ripple upon the water was a message, a communication from Ivor and Mariska, carried from the depths of realms unseen. The lilies were not just botanical wonders but symbols of unity and the cyclical nature of existence. In this village, where myth had bloomed into reality and back again, there lived no person who doubted the potency of wonder and the power of the stories we tell. They passed down the oral tradition, the legend of the Daughter of Constellations and her beloved, whose devotion had transcended the finitude of their earthly bodies to become something altogether more profound. To the outsider, this hamlet might have seemed a quaint artifact of bygone fables, a place out of time where the impossible was merely the unexplored. Yet, to those whose roots drank from its soil, whose breath was cradled by its air, it was a bastion of enduring truth – that within the delicate balance of life's symphony, there existed notes that resonated with the cosmic, harmonies that wove reality and fantasy into a singular, luminous thread. Within this thread was the story of “Little Nothing,” an ever-unfurling scroll crafted from the tapestry of human experience. It was a story that affirmed the beauty of ambiguity, the strength in vulnerability, and the wisdom in embracing the unknown. The unbreakable bond between Ivor and Mariska was not an end but a genesis, a point from which countless narratives would diverge, each one carrying a spark of the miraculous, a fragment of the eternal truth that lay at the heart of their love. As the years cascaded into memory, and the memory into legend, the pond and its lilies stood as a beacon, a lighthouse that beckoned to the seeker in each soul. It called to the wanderer, the dreamer, the lover, the poet – to anyone who heard the subtle song that thrummed beneath the cacophony of mundane existence. It was a promise that within the vastness of the void, within the \\"little nothing\\" that spanned the cosmos, there lay everything one could possibly imagine – and even that which defied imagination. And so the story wound on, a continuous stream that flowed from past to present, from present to future, the lines of narrative twisting, turning, and intertwining like the roots of the ancient trees that stood watch around the village. It was a story of perpetual becoming, a story that, like the water lilies upon their serene pond, refused to be confined by simple categorization, forever challenging those who encountered it to see the world anew – with eyes full of wonder, hearts full of courage, and minds open to the boundless possibilities of \\"Little Nothing.\\""},{"instruction":"","output":"As the village aged and new generations took their place upon the stage of life, the story of “Little Nothing” acquired a patina of ages past, its details sharpened and softened in turn by the ever-evolving touch of time. The pond, once the province of a love transcendent, had become a sanctuary of contemplation, a place where the tangible kiss of breeze and the fragrant whisper of blossoms inspired thoughts higher and deeper than the daily toil of existence. Here, the villagers came not only to feed upon the tranquility of nature but to sip from the cup of shared humanity, to partake in the communion of stories told and retold. The water lilies, white as the moon and serene as the undisturbed dawn, bloomed not merely in the water but in the collective consciousness of the village, their very existence a reminder of a truth that transcended the literal, tapping into the veins of the metaphysical, the magical. Each villager’s life was now a unique note in the symphony of their history, their pursuits and passions, dreams and dramas, all colored by the heritage of Mariska and Ivor. The tale of transformation and unity, of love that had bent the fabric of their reality, became the lodestar by which they navigated the complexities of their lives. In this village, the barriers between folklore and fact, between the secular and the sacred, grew ever more transparent. Traditional celebrations took on new dimensions as they were imbued with the essence of the lilies – symbols of the enduring nature of love, of the transformative power of sacrifice, and of the boundlessness of the human spirit. Art blossomed alongside the lilies, as the village became renowned for its tapestries, music, and poetry – each expression a homage to the continuing story. Weavers incorporated designs of stars and water, circlets of lilies and ripples of water, their threads capturing the delicate balance between disappearance and reappearance, between presence and absence that defined Mariska's journey. Musicians composed ballads that seemed to echo the melodies Mariska had once whispered to the shadows, now enriched with Ivor’s unspoken yearnings, their harmonies carrying tales of hidden worlds flirting with revelation upon the sinuous paths of sound. Poets penned verses that danced upon the precipice of understanding, where words sought to grasp the ineffable majesty of the tale. Their poems were recited by the water's edge, the reflective pool a perfect audience, forever holding the echoes of their lines in its tranquil bosom. The water lilies became the signet of the village, a sigil that signified more than mere identity – they were a declaration of belief in the unseen and the intuited, in the narrative that spanned realms and touched the ineffable. Each bloom that dotted the pond’s surface was a star in their earthly firmament, a light guiding them through the shadowy corridors of doubt and fear, toward the light of shared understanding and unity. Thus, the fable of Mariska and Ivor grew into an epic that defied the erosion of eras, an odyssey that charted its course through the hearts and minds of all who dwelled within the village’s gentle embrace. The teachings of their story – of fluidity over rigidity, of the alchemical power of love, and the sacred dance of change – became the foundations upon which the village stood, a testament to the enduring legacy left by the little nothing that had, paradoxically, come to mean everything. The tapestry of \\"Little Nothing\\" spread, threads reaching out to distant lands as travelers came to witness the pond of the lilies, to hear the story from those who held it not just in memory but in their souls. They carried away with them the seeds of the village’s wisdom, planting them in the fertile ground of their own homes, their minds opened to the possibility that reality was a vast, interwoven tapestry of the seen and unseen, a canvas upon which the human condition in all its complexity and beauty played out across times and tides. And the narrative spun on, a perpetual motion machine fueled by the essence of wonder and inquiry, each moment a brushstroke, each life a color upon the evolving mural of existence. The village and its people became both custodians and characters within the grand narrative crafted by Mariska and Ivor, the story of “Little Nothing” a beacon that shone through the fog of mundanity, revealing a world awash with enchantment, waiting patiently for those brave enough to seek, to find, to understand, and, ultimately, to become one with the tale that never truly ends."},{"instruction":"","output":"Time marched forth, a relentless guard leading the parade of seasons that dressed and undressed the earth in a myriad of colors. The village, encircled by the lore of the water lilies, became a bastion of story, its inhabitants walking, living archives of the narrative that had seeped into the soil and soul of their land. The people who drew from the spring of the community drank also from the fount of their shared heritage, each drop infused with the essence of Mariska and Ivor’s transcendent union. No longer did the villagers see their petty sorrows and fleeting joys as mere ripples in the pond of existence. Instead, their individual narratives were seen as integral to the grand tale that had been woven by those who had entered the fabric of myth. Each birth and death, each celebration and mourning, each triumph and tribulation were viewed through the lens of their collective mythos, a single thread deftly looped into the greater design of a narrative tapestry. The pond itself, the keeper of the water lilies, was now a sacred site, its waters believed to hold the reflections of every soul that had stood by its banks. It was said that to gaze into the pond was to see not just one’s own visage, but the countenance of the village, the spirit of the lilies, and the whisper of Mariska and Ivor’s enduring devotion. Artisans crafted vessels and vials designed to capture the pond's water, and poets wrote of this liquid as a draught of remembrance and prophecy. It was no mere superstition, but a cultured faith in the sublime links between their earthly world and the ethereal realm beyond. The village became a sanctuary where travelers from afar sought solace and inspiration. They came bearing their own tales and left with a piece of the myth that had found root by the pond. The water lilies’ story was a contagion spreading not of illness but of enlightenment, a gospel of the heart and spirit that spoke to anyone who had loved, lost, or longed. The festivals of the village now carried the emblem of the water lily, each celebration a nod to the interplay of light and shadow that defined existence. The equinoxes were honored as times of balance, symbolic of Mariska’s walk between realms, and the solstices celebrated the extremes of her transformations. Fires were lit, songs sung, and dances performed with a fervor that beseeched the sky for the same passion that had burned in the hearts of the lovers immortalized by their tale. Ivor and Mariska’s saga, once localized to the confines of their home, had become a cosmogony for the village, a creation myth that explicated their own evolution from isolation to integration, from ignorance to a dawning wisdom that spanned beyond the corporeal to the cosmic. The younger generations, born into a world alive with the reverberations of “Little Nothing,” grew up perceiving life as a phantasmagoria of possibilities where magic was reality clothed in the gossamer garb of the mundane. The pond and its lilies were their playground and their temple; in their reflection, they sought the visages of their ancestors and the promise of their own potential. Thus, the story persisted, a perpetual motion of mythmaking, its vitality undiminished by the attrition of age. The tale of the water lilies—of Mariska, the mystical changeling, and Ivor, the human anchor—endured, their love a lighthouse that shone upon the shores of human experience, guiding the wayward to safe harbor in the knowledge that within the “little nothing,” lay the seeds of everything, the microcosm of the world’s endless story, waiting only for the right moment to bloom into the majesty of the grand, collective memory. And as the world turned, as stars wheeled in their silent watch, the village and its pond—a crucible of legend, a crucible of life—thrived. The story of “Little Nothing” was eternal, a river that flowed from yesterday into tomorrow, carrying atop its waves the tales of those gone by and those yet to come, forever fresh, forever new, forever a hymn to the ceaseless wonder of being."},{"instruction":"Describe Si₆H₂(NO₂)₃SiH₃","output":"Si₆H₂(NO₂)₃SiH₃ is a chemical compound that consists of silicon atoms bonded to hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms.

Существует также классификация событий на: 1. **Достоверное событие**: происходит всегда в данном испытании (например, при броске кубика выпадет число от 1 до 6). 2. **Невозможное событие**: не происходит никогда (например, при броске обычного кубика выпадет число 7). 3. **Случайное событие**: может произойти или не произойти в данном испытании (например, при броске кубика выпадет чётное число). События также могут быть: - **Не́совместимые (несовместные)**: не могут произойти одновременно (например, при одном броске монеты не могут выпасть орёл и решка одновременно). - **Совместные**: могут произойти одновременно (например, при выборе случайного числа от 1 до 6 событие \\"выбрано четное число\\" совместно с событием \\"выбрано число больше трёх\\"). - **Независимые**: наступление одного не влияет на наступление другого (например, результаты бросков двух разных кубиков независимы). - **Зависимые**: наступление одного влияет на вероятность наступления другого (например, извлечение карт из колоды без возвращения — если вытащили туза, вероятность вытащить ещё одного туза уменьшается). **Примеры:** 1. Бросок игрального кубика — испытание. Возможны события: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6} — это элементарные события, так как кубик может показать только одну из этих цифр за каждый бросок. 2. Событие \\"при броске кубика выпало чётное число\\" — это сложное событие, так как для его реализации возможны несколько элементарных событий {2}, {4}, {6}. 3. Событие \\"при броске двух кубиков сумма выпавших очков будет 8\\" — сложное событие, так как есть несколько комбинаций элементарных событий (2 и 6, 3 и 5, 4 и 4 и т.д.), которые приводят к его наступлению."},{"instruction":"2.

And yesterday, the actor for the role of the 'Beast' was confirmed.” ] The male and female anchors, along with a guest expert, were covering various news, including cultural issues, and it was the 'Beauty and the Beast' that had been on fire overnight. -[“Among the candidate actors, actor Kang Woo-jin unexpectedly announced it on the 'Jamie Show,' right?”] 108 -[“Yes, after that, 'World Disney Pictures' consecutively uploaded on their official SNS that Kang Woo-jin was the one.”] Soon, the news screen showing the anchors switched to Kang Woo-jin. It was a montage of various photos, but many were from the 'Jamie Show' that aired yesterday. Seeing this, Woo-jin, forgetting his concept, was busy looking at his own image in the news. \\"Oh- why is it so fascinating?\\" It wasn't a strange sight. His face was appearing on a famous American news show, and the news was even featuring Kang Woo-jin as the main topic. He had experienced this several times in Korea, but seeing himself on American news felt very unfamiliar. The news screen showing Woo-jin then switched back to the anchors. -[“Kang Woo-jin's actions are really unique.”] -[“Right, he has achieved many firsts as a Korean actor, from turning Cannes upside down and winning the Best Actor award, to the album he did with Miley Cara, the confirmation of the lead role in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' and the start of 'Beneficial Evil' in the U.S. at number one, and now the confirmation of the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast.'”] -[“Wow, hearing it directly is even more astonishing. Moreover, isn't Kang Woo-jin the first to land lead roles in both Columbia and Disney at the same time?”] -[“There's that, but the point to focus on is the period. It hasn't even been half a year since Kang Woo-jin turned Cannes and now Hollywood upside down.”] ] The anchor and the guest expert filled the corner with a conversational style, adding a bit of analysis. Of course, Kang Woo-jin's name was mentioned countless times in the meantime. There had been news about Korea in American news before, but it was unique for Woo-jin to have such a long, exclusive segment. DOB -[“Why is he receiving the spotlight in Hollywood as soon as he appeared?”] Kang Woo-jin, who had his arms crossed, reacted to the question heard in the news. “Yeah, what is it? Let's hear an answer.” The foreign expert with a beard around his chin and mouth immediately responded. -[“He showed unprecedented speed even in Korea. Would you believe it if I said Kang Woo-jin is only in his third year since debut?”] - [“Three years? Really?”] -[“Yes. But despite his short career, Kang Woo-jin is secretive and somewhat eccentric. His character is interesting. According to someone who has met him, if you only look at his background, he seems like a novice, but inside, it's as if a veteran of decades is hiding. That person described it as the aura of a star.”] Kang Woo-jin's lips curled up for a moment. “Who is it? Who said such a special thing?” The TV expert, who had no way of knowing this, continued. 008 -[“Of course, his actions exposed to the media are also not ordinary. At Cannes, where many Hollywood figures attended, he casually mentioned the 'Academy Award' in his speech, and it was the same at the press conference where he announced the lead role in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' And on the 'Jamie Show,' where his role as the 'Beast' was confirmed, he boldly proclaimed to the global public criticizing him, 'Criticize me after watching the work.'”] ] -[“Hmm- he has a fearless, mischievous vibe to him.”] -[“Yes. But he's not frivolous. He has talent, which is why he's successful in Cannes and Hollywood, and his influence is currently being proven by 'Beneficial Evil.' He has even turned critics into fans. There may be differing opinions, but one thing is certain: he is the first type of actor to appear in Hollywood so far.”] ] -[“Is that the driving force?””] -[“Including those, his handsome appearance, various languages, and various skills also play a part. His musicality as well, and this time, the role of the 'Beast' will inevitably cause a fierce controversy, but on the contrary, Kang Woo-jin's recognition will skyrocket continuously.”] ] Kang Woo-jin gave a thumbs up towards the TV after hearing the explanation. “You, I acknowledge the expert.” The news continued to talk about Kang Woo-jin for a few more minutes before changing the topic. It had been about 10 minutes or more. Around this time, a call came. The caller was Choi Seong-gun. “Did you watch all the news?” “Yes, President.” DOB “Right, but it's going to get noisier once Disney starts proper promotion. How do you feel, being the first Korean actor to be introduced alone on the news here?” Woo-jin's response was calm, though he felt like doing a cheeky dance show. “It's just like that.” Choi Seong-gun laughed over the phone. “Keke, I knew it. Get ready, we have to go to 'World Disney Pictures.'” Afterward. Kang Woo-jin, who met with Choi Seong-gun and the team members, boarded a large van. Even as the van started to move quickly, Kang Woo-jin's name echoed in English. It was the car radio. The American morning news was followed by the radio also delivering news about 'Beauty and the Beast.' DOB The team members' fuss ensued. However, Kang Woo-jin's poker face was solid. Still, he felt genuinely amazed inside. What was it like, having my name spread across this vast country of America? He felt that emotion. Woo-jin crossed his legs and picked up his phone. The first thing he accessed was YouTube, to check the situation on the 'Kang Woo-jin Sub-character' channel, but there was no need. ‘The reaction is crazy.’ Kang Woo-jin had already dominated the top 10 real-time videos. -Kang Woo-jin confirmed as the 'Beast'! #KangWoojin#Hollywood#BeautyandtheBeast#Disney#JamieShow | Overseas Topic Issue TV -<< Compilation of Hollywood actors' reactions to Kang Woo-jin being confirmed as the Beast!!! (Flutter!!) >> | Movie Bell From issue-specialized YouTubers to various YouTubers, they mentioned 'Beauty and the Beast' or Kang Woo-jin because it was currently the hottest issue. Not only Korean YouTube but also American YouTube was similar. Woo-jin didn't check himself, but it was obvious that YouTubes around the world were heated with the same issue. Kang Woo-jin touched any video on the 'Kang Woo-jin Sub-character' channel and then -Swish. Immediately turned it off. 08 ‘Ah, seriously, it's crazy.” The comments were saturated, much more of a mess than before. SNS was no quieter. As if mocking YouTube, people from all countries in the world seemed to be flocking to Woo-jin's SNS. Here, Kang Woo-jin couldn't help but laugh. ‘Hollywood's power is really something.” The media and public opinion were both a loud noise, globally. That world naturally included Korea, and it was more intense than any other country. 『Kang Woo-jin, the first Korean actor to lead in Disney, confirmed for the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'!』 『 Kang Woo-jin, who proclaimed to the world on the 'Jamie Show,' outshines prominent Hollywood actors to secure the lead role in 'Beauty and the Beast'』 『[Star Talk] Kang Woo-jin, the first Korean male actor to lead in Disney, the world cries out for him / Photo』 A day passed. -Kang Woo-jin is really crazy ฀ ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ Shiba, it seems like he's doing things roughly, but he's eating up the world ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ -National pride is thrilling....

Ambassador selection world number one』 And. 『Kang Woo-jin's 'Beneficial Evil,' to the U.S. Emmy Awards? ... Foreign media \\"Qualified for nomination\\" 』 The insane momentum of 'Beneficial Evil' continued as well. About a week later, on the 28th, in LA. As Kang Woo-jin's global recognition grew more intense by the day, the last day of February, the 28th, dawned. It was around 10 a.m. The location was the 'spt studio,' a massive set complex of over 50,000 square feet where the actual filming of 'Beauty and the Beast' would take place. In front of the stage where the audition for the role of the 'Beast' took place, it was bustling. DOB Various vans, trucks, and buses were parked, and around them, easily over a hundred foreigners were running around. Naturally, they were the staff of 'Beauty and the Beast.' In front of such a stage, a large white van had just arrived. And then. -Swish. A woman with impressive brown eyes and a significant portion of her face taken up by her eyes got out of the car. With clear features, a perky nose, thick eyebrows, and hair that was brown at the crown but turned blonde towards the shoulders, she stood out for her beauty even in a simple hoodie. Her aura was extraordinary. Naturally. She was one of the top actresses in Hollywood. Soon, her team members joined her. “Maria, go into the set and greet the team, then you need to put on the dress costume.” O 8 Her name was Maria Armas, a Spanish-born actress currently active as a top Hollywood actress. After listening to the muscular man's words, she sighed and spoke in English. “An audition, just a screen test, and I have to wear a dress too?” “What can we do? You know how meticulous 'World Disney Pictures' is, right? Director Vilrotner is the same. Even during the 'Beast' role audition, all the male actors wore formal attire, so stop complaining and just wear it.” “Such a hassle.” “Then are you going to give up the role of 'Beauty Bella' just like that?” Maria frowned. “Are you crazy? Why would I do that for someone else's pleasure? I can't stand the thought of Miley laughing. Why do I have to be the first one to start?” “Sigh, why do you and Miley Cara not get along so well?” “It's just a natural clash, I felt it for sure when we worked on a project together before.” That was the case. Today was the official audition for the role of 'Beauty Bella' in 'Beauty and the Beast.' In other words, Maria was one of the five candidate actresses. Soon, Maria, who had been running her fingers through her mixed brown and blonde hair, moved. “But why is that actor participating in today's audition?” \\"That actor?\\" DOB “You know, the one from Korea.” “Ah- Kang Woo-jin.” The muscular man shrugged. “I'm not sure exactly, but I think the production team wants to see the chemistry between the 'Beast' and 'Beauty Bella.' Since 'Beast' has already been confirmed as Kang Woo-jin.” Maria grumbled as she chewed on her lip. “I don't like him.” “Maria, there are a lot of people around.” She suddenly stopped walking and looked at the huge warehouse-like stage in front of her, speaking again. “Do I really dislike him that much?” This time it wasn't English. It was Spanish. “I saw Kang Woo-jin's interviews at Cannes and 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' He disrespected the 'Academy Award' and seems to take it lightly, and I haven't even won that award yet... And Kang Woo-jin doesn't fit the role of the 'Beast.'” 000 8 The muscular man sighed. “Maria, speak in English. I don't understand what you're saying.” But Maria continued in Spanish. “He's a bit—lacking to play the 'Beast.' No, he doesn't fit the 'Prince' rather than the 'Beast.' The 'Prince' should be more handsome.” That's when it happened. “That's a pity.” A fluent Spanish voice with a low tone interjected from behind. As a result, everyone from Maria to her team members turned their heads. A man with black hair was walking towards them. -Swish. It was Kang Woo-jin. With an indifferent face, he approached Maria and as she saw Woo-jin, her big eyes widened. Regardless, Kang Woo-jin spoke to her calmly. 108 From the past experience of reading for 'Jurassic Land 4.' “You are less attractive than Miley Cara.” His Spanish was at the level of a native speaker. < Loud Noise (3) > End"},{"instruction":"Write an SEO optimised article for Siddhartha Gupta who topped the UPPSC exam 2023","output":"Title: Siddhartha Gupta Achieves First Place in the UPPSC 2023 Exam: A Stirling Example of Dedication and Hard Work Meta Description: Siddhartha Gupta emerges as the UPPSC 2023 topper.

America found a Tiger tank with a Japanese insignia on it somewhere in France and ended up taking it to a museum in Japan and while Japan was surrendering, Japan was busy writing a angry letter to Germany wanting his Tiger back.","output":"Title: The Tail of the Tiger's Voyage Opening Scene: The camera pans across a serene landscape filled with cherry blossoms. Various Hetalia characters enjoy a picturesque spring day. The pastoral peace is shattered as Japan barges into the scene, looking rather flustered and carrying a stack of old letters. Japan: \\"Ah, friends! You will not believe the story I have to share. The tale of the time I very nearly had my own Tiger tank!\\" Germany, looking somewhat guilty, steps forward hesitantly. Germany: \\"Oh, Japan, are we really going to talk about that? It was... a logistical nightmare.\\" Flashback - Scene 1: A younger-looking Japan is shown eagerly shaking hands with Germany while looking at blueprints for the impressive Tiger tank. Narrator: \\"During the fires of conflict in World War II, it was not uncommon for allied nations to share their technologies. For Japan and Germany, this meant sharing some of the era's most formidable machines...\\" Scene 2: Japan's engineers struggle to figure out how to transport the massive tank. The I-400-class submarine emerges grandly from the water, but it's clear the tank is far too large to fit inside. Engineer: \\"Sumimasen, but the Tiger is simply too heavy, too large!\\" Japan, looking determined, starts drafting numerous solutions, none of which are realistic. Scene 3: Germany is seen reluctantly writing a refund check back to Japan, who is clearly disappointed, the dream of having its own Tiger tank slipping away. Germany: \\"I am sorry, my friend, but it seems the seas themselves conspire against us.\\" Transition back to Present Day. America, trying to hide a smirk: \\"Oh man, that's not even the best part! Guess what I found while I was strutting through France?\\" Flashback - Scene 4: America is shown encountering a Tiger tank with the rising sun insignia. He looks confused but intrigued. America: \\"No way, is this... Japanese?\\" Scene 5: After some research, America decides to take the tank back to a museum in Japan, metaphorically rubbing salt into Japan's wound. America: \\"I figured it belonged here, right, Japan? It's like I always say, 'finders, keepers!'\\" Present Day: Japan rolls his eyes but accepts the tank in the museum, pointing out that history has a strange sense of humor. Japan: \\"Indeed, the Tiger made its way to my home, but not as I once envisioned.\\" Scene 6: As Japan signs the instrument of surrender, he is shown furiously scribbling an angry letter to Germany, mumbling about promises and commitments, little does he realize that it's far too late for such discussions.

Germany approaches Japan, offering a sincere apology and an oversized novelty check as a symbol of goodwill. Germany: \\"Let us never speak of the Tiger tank again, shall we?\\" Japan, with a half-smile: \\"Agreed, but let us also never forget how plans on paper can often go awry in the waves of reality.\\" The scene fades to black as the credits roll, the Hetalia characters' laughter blending with the tranquil ambiance of Japan's cherry blossom-filled landscape.

Write about 400 words A survey found that the majority of Hong Kong people in their 60s would like to have the option to work past the retirement age of 65. In contrast, there is a growing number of young people whose goal is to retire in their 30s or 40s. Write a news article for the Hong Kong Daily about these different views towards retirement.","output":"Title: Hong Kong's Generation Gap in Retirement Perspectives: Working into Older Age vs. Early Retirement Dreams Hong Kong Daily — Recent surveys reveal a striking dichotomy in retirement aspirations between two age cohorts in Hong Kong, reflecting broader social trends and economic pressures. While many individuals in their 60s are expressing the desire to stay in the workforce beyond the traditional retirement age of 65, there is a burgeoning contingent of young professionals aiming to exit the labor market as early as their 30s or 40s, signifying a generational shift in attitudes toward work and leisure. The research, conducted by the Hong Kong Institute for Social Research, indicates that 65% of Hong Kong residents in their 60s would prefer the option to continue working past retirement age. Many cite the desire to stay active and engaged in the community, as well as the need for additional financial security in light of rising living costs and concerns about the adequacy of their retirement savings. Mr. Wong, a 67-year-old accountant, encapsulates this sentiment: \\"I've worked all my life, and I still feel energetic and mentally sharp. Retirement doesn't mean I have to stop contributing. Plus, with the economy the way it is, a little extra income doesn't hurt.\\" In stark contrast, a growing number of Hong Kong’s younger generation has been swept up in the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early). This shift is illustrated by online forums and social media groups, where thousands of Millennials and Gen Zers share tips on aggressive saving, investing, and lifestyle changes aimed at achieving financial independence decades sooner than their predecessors. Samantha Lee, a 28-year-old marketing executive and a proponent of FIRE, explains her perspective: \\"Why wait until old age to enjoy life? With smart financial planning, I hope to retire by 40 and travel the world. I don't want to miss out on life's experiences because I'm too busy working.\\" The contrasting approaches to retirement may be reflective of the changing economic landscape in Hong Kong. The older demographic is facing the reality of longer life expectancies coupled with concerns over whether their pensions will suffice, given the expensive healthcare and high cost of living in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the younger generation is navigating an uncertain financial future marked by competitive job markets, skyrocketing housing prices, and stagnating wages. The allure of early retirement is paired with a cautious optimism and a belief in the power of personal finance management. These divergent retirement goals also highlight the different cultural values assigned to work and leisure between generations. For many senior citizens, work is not only a source of income but also an integral part of their identity and societal contribution. Conversely, younger Hong Kong residents increasingly prioritize work-life balance and personal fulfillment over traditional career trajectories. Mr. Lee, a financial planner, weighs in on the trend: \\"There's no one-size-fits-all retirement plan. Older workers might benefit from flexible working arrangements, while younger clients often need guidance on investment strategies for early retirement.\\" The findings of this study may have significant implications for policy-making, labor markets, and financial services in Hong Kong. As citizens across the age spectrum rethink retirement, it is clear that flexible employment policies and innovative financial products will be key to accommodating diverse retirement strategies and ensuring that all Hong Kongers can achieve their desired quality of life, both now and in their later years. -END-"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In the indistinct space between village and wilderness, where the murmurs of the ancient trees arose like incantations, the story of Mariska unfurled like the petals of an otherworldly flower. Born to parents who had long since given up on the dream of a child, her arrival was met with ambivalence; as she was perceived to be marked with a peculiar destiny in her eyes, ones that held a fathomless depth not unlike the night sky. The villagers kept a respectful distance from Mariska, treating her with a mixture of reverence and trepidation. She was of them, yet not; a girl whose limbs seemed to whisper the secrets of a faraway world with each graceful movement. They murmured that she was the offspring of a pact with the mystical forces that governed their fates, a living testament to the blurred lines between human and the arcane forces that toyed with mortal lives. As she grew, her parents observed subtle transformations not just in her physique but in her essence. It was during those twilight hours, when the sky melted into a palette of dusky violets and soft oranges, that her parents would find her conversing with shadows cast by nothing, speaking a language that brushed against the ears like the rustling of leaves. “Mariska,” her mother would scold gently, a wreathe of worry framing her features, “Remember who you are, and to whom you belong.” But Mariska’s essence was elusive, as if a part of her spirit danced perpetually in another realm, her fate intertwined with mysteries as confounding as the labyrinthine forests that bordered their home. The villagers whispered of prophecies whispered on the winds, of a girl fated to dissolve and rematerialize in forms no living eyes had ever beheld. The tendrils of Mariska’s story wove themselves around the heart of Ivor, a boy of the village who watched her with a longing that outstripped the boundaries of their shared reality. It was Ivor who noticed the shifts in Mariska’s comportment, the way her shadow sometimes fluttered independent of its source, the way she sometimes paused in her step, her gaze penetrating the veil to something unseen and unfathomable. Ivor, in a quiet defiance of the unspoken village decree, began to inch closer to Mariska’s orbit, drawn by an internal force he could neither name nor resist. His heart, like a lodestone, was fixed on the enigma that was Mariska. And as they slowly entwined, a narrative awaited them, laced with greater intricacy than the finely spun tales of the weaver birds nesting in the canopy above. Yet, under the burden of an evening sky that held the promise of revelations, Ivor could not shake the sense of foreboding laced within Mariska’s enigmatic smiles and cryptic utterances. There was a secret nestled deep within her being that beckoned him with both beauty and dread. Ivor began to dream of labyrinths – not the kind made of stone and vine as in the old tales, but rather paths outlined by the interweaving lines of fate and chance. In his slumber, he wandered endless corridors that echoed with a haunting melody, the song of Mariska’s whispered language. It was a melody that seemed to both call him deeper into the maze and caution him against its center, where the unknown thrummed with the potency of a storm waiting to break. When he awoke, his mind was alight with the persistent notion that Mariska was the labyrinth itself; a living, breathing enigma that one could explore but perhaps never truly understand or escape. Ivor knew that to love Mariska was to entangle himself in the spirals of her mystery, where each revelation might only herald greater puzzles. As the days unfurled like the wings of the exotic butterflies that occasionally flitted through the village – admired but forever beyond grasp – Ivor found moments to walk with Mariska. They traced the borders of their world, toes skirting the edge of the shadows cast by the ancient trees, as if toying with the thresholds of other realms. “What are you looking for, Mariska?” Ivor once dared to ask, his voice tentative as if afraid to unravel the very mystery he was compelled to solve. Mariska turned to him, her gaze holding the memory of stardust and unspoken history. “I am in search of the same thing that seeks us all,” she replied, her words carrying the weight of a prophecy or a riddle. “Understanding, transformation, becoming… perhaps I too am merely a character in search of my place within the grand narrative.” Her fingers brushed against the contours of a rough-barked tree, its ancient skin a chronicle of years beyond count. Ivor watched the shadows play around her, feeling both near to the core of her essence and hopelessly distant. In her presence, he could sense the dense fog of inevitability that clung to her, a destiny that whispered of great and irrevocable change. One afternoon, as they rested in the shade of a gnarled oak, a strange stillness enveloped the pair. Mariska’s eyes fluttered shut, and her breath became a soft cadence that seemed to harmonize with the rhythm of the earth. It was then that Ivor witnessed the most profound of her transformations, one never before seen by mortal eyes. She unfolded, not in body but in being, her essence shimmering like a mirage. She became translucent, a spirit draped in the gossamer threads of twilight. Before Ivor’s astonished eyes, she expanded, her form dissipating to intertwine with the elements around them – the air, the soil, the whispering leaves. Overwhelmed with awe and an edge of fear, Ivor reached out – not to touch Mariska, for she was everywhere and nowhere all at once – but to somehow affirm his own reality in the face of such an impossible marvel. As he did so, the world snapped back into focus, and Mariska returned to her human shape, as if she had never left it. Neither spoke of the transformation, words powerless against the magnitude of what had transpired. Yet, Ivor had crossed a threshold of understanding: Mariska held within her a magic that was both a gift and a burden, a source of wonder and a harbinger of trials yet to endure. As night fell and the two walked back to the village – a place increasingly alien to Mariska – Ivor grappled with his role in her story, unknowingly inching ever closer to the heart of the labyrinth. The tale of Mariska, ever-unfolding, unforgiving in its complexity, became the stuff of fevered whispers around village fires. Ivor, now held in the thrall of her inexplicable alterations, grappled with his own transformation: from an idle spectator to a steadfast sentinel on the perimeter of a saga both fearsome and alluring. In the world beyond their village – a world Mariska seemed as connected to as she was detached from – the skies whispered of change. Elders spoke of celestial portents, of stars aligning in patterns unrecorded by history, and of a great turning that was upon them. What role Mariska, whom many had begun to call the Daughter of Constellations, would play in this drama, was at once a question too fearful to ask and too urgent to ignore. Ivor, with the saturnine knowledge of Mariska’s otherness weighing heavy on his chest, sensed the burgeoning responsibility within himself to protect her. Yet, he wondered, who could shield the wind, guide the river, or fence the wandering light of evening stars? It was a conundrum that tethered Ivor to Mariska irrevocably, binding him to a destiny neither fully understood. Their walks became fraught with an electric tension, each step an act of defiance against the forces that sought to claim Mariska. In these moments, Ivor saw not the specters of mythical creatures or the shadows of old gods in their sacred grove, but rather the reflection of a question that echoed in his own heart: could love act as a compass in a narrative dictated by powers unseen? It was during an eclipse, when the sun surrendered to the moon’s embrace, that Mariska spoke of her dreams – not of labyrinths of stone or fate – but of water. “Beneath the surface,” she murmured, the air around her quivering with the energy of her revelations, “where light bends and truth drowns, I am there, and I am something else entirely.” “The water,” Ivor pondered, his thoughts swimming to the surface. “Is it another maze for us to navigate?” “Perhaps,” Mariska agreed, her eyes reflecting the uncanny darkness that had washed over their world. “Or perhaps it is the place where all mazes converge, where all that is fragmented finds harmony.” Ivor’s heartbeats were a drumbeat pacing the moments until the sun emerged once more, fierce and declaring its reign over the sky. In that rekindled light, he saw the myth of Mariska anew – not as chains of predestination, but as a tapestry of potential woven by hands unseen. Their bond deepened, became something venerated and unspoken. It was like the untracked path through a wood, or the undercurrent of a stream: always present, yet eluding the grasp of those who sought to chart its course. Ivor understood then, that his quest was not to unravel Mariska, nor to tether her to a realm too narrow for her spirit. His quest was to accompany her, to share in the wonder and terror that her journey entailed, and to offer his presence as a beacon in whatever passages – be they of water or of some transformative ether – she might traverse. As they returned to the ever-changing face of their village, it seemed to Ivor that the world itself was reshaping, the lines between myth and reality ever more blurred, humming with the resonance of Mariska’s evanescent melody. Each heart in the village, whether they recognized it or not, beat in rhythm to the unfolding narrative – a melody at once haunting and beautiful – a little nothing that held everything within. Days blended into nights with the imperceptible grace of shadows stretching toward twilight, the nuances of the villagers’ lives echoing the enigmatic pulse of Mariska’s existence. The Daughter of Constellations had become the unseen axis upon which their world turned, the measure of their fears and fascinations. Ivor, whose soul had become attuned to the rhythm of her breaths, watched as the seasons greeted Mariska with a nod of acknowledgment, as if she were an old friend, a confidante privy to the earth’s most guarded secrets. Through his eyes, the villagers glimpsed the awe of this connection, though none dared to tread too closely to the mystery that unfolded between human and the beat of the world. As autumnal hues painted the village in tones of fire and gold, Mariska found herself drawn to the edge of the wood where a pond lay hidden, a mirror to the sky and a whisper to the depths. It was here, Ivor noticed, that her dreams of water seemed to coalesce into intent, her gaze piercing the surface as if seeking communion with the soul beneath. Ivor stood sentinel, providing silent companionship, as Mariska knelt by the water’s edge. She extended her slender fingers toward the liquid expanse, touching the reflection of a lone cloud that dared voyage across the pond’s still face. With her touch, the water rippled, distorting the world above, creating a chasm of light and shadow. “The water,” she whispered, her eyes reflecting the turmoil of the ripples, “it’s not a maze, but a gateway, the place of becoming and unbecoming – the veil is thinnest here.” Ivor felt a tremor of destiny unfurl between them. Mariska was not merely observing the water; she was beckoning something ancient and profound from its depths. The pond, once a silent repository of fallen leaves and the occasional errant stone, began to pulse with a rhythm that echoed the heartbeats of all who drew near. An incandescent glow emerged from the deep, cradling Mariska’s reflection as if to merge essence with image. There was no great fanfare, no tempest of magic and might – only the placid revelation that realms beyond their own brushed fingertips with the quiet world of the villagers. Mariska, entranced, reached further, her entire being leaning into the threshold. Ivor, heart clenched with terror and wonder, reached out to anchor her to the here and now. But before their hands met, she turned to him with a seraphic tranquility. “Do not fear,” she soothed, her voice a lullaby to the thrashing soul. “This is but a passage, a crossing over into the melody that has always been – a dissonance in search of harmony.” In that moment, her words became the loom upon which Ivor wove his understanding; Mariska was not to be protected from her fate but rather accompanied with reverence and courage as she explored the deep and vast verses of her story. Together, they would unfurl the threads, entwining their narratives in a duet that transcended the measures of mere song and discourse. As the glow enveloped Mariska, she offered Ivor an ethereal smile, her body slowly submerging into the water’s embrace. Ivor, heart steadfast, watched as she dissolved into the light, her form scattering into countless reflections of herself, each a nuance of the enigma that was her essence. The pond stilled once more, the gateway closing gently, leaving behind the softly murmuring world and a young man whose eyes now held depths rivaling the very waters that embraced his love. Ivor, alone but not bereft, understood that Mariska’s transformation was not an ending but an overture to the profound symphony of their intertwined legends. The villagers, beholding the change in Ivor, whispered among themselves that fate had carved into their midst a story of such magnitude that its echoes would resonate through their lives and beyond. As Ivor walked among them, his gaze lingering upon places where Mariska had walked, spoken, and changed, they understood that the lines between myth and reality were merely brushstrokes on the canvas of their world, an ever-expanding tableau of wonder and mystery. The novelistic tones of “Little Nothing” swirled around them, their narrative arcs bending toward an ever-elusive horizon where the next chapter waited, patient and undiscovered. Mariska, who had been a tempest, was now silent as the deep. Her absence was a hollow that resonated through Ivor’s every step, her presence as palpable as the chill of dawn’s first breath. Yet in the silence left by her voyage, stories began to sprout like wildflowers in untended fields. Tales of a woman who could become water, who could commune with the spirits of the deep, who was both lost to the known world and profoundly present in the constant cycle of ebb and flow. In the days that followed, the villagers approached Ivor with a newfound reverence, as if through his shared journey with Mariska, he had attained a wisdom that far exceeded the boundaries of their simple lives. He became a figure of myth interwoven with flesh, a touchstone for all those who sought to understand the mysteries Mariska had embodied. Ivor, for his part, found himself wandering the paths of their village and the edges of the woods, as if he could somehow trace Mariska’s steps into understanding. He became a guardian of the tales, ensuring that with each telling, Mariska’s story was imbued with the wonder and respect it deserved – a beacon in the dark for all seekers of truth. The eclipse that had marked the beginning of Mariska’s passage now became a symbol within the village, a moment when one world kissed another, when the veil was lifted, and transformation was not only possible but inevitable. Yet Ivor yearned for more than memories and symbols. Each night, he would return to the pond, now sacred to those who knew of its hidden doorway. There, beneath the canvas of stars, Ivor would speak to Mariska, his words simple whispers that danced upon the water’s surface, hoping they would sink into the depths and find her. “Mariska, you are the little nothing that holds everything,” he would say, his heart aching with the beauty of their shared moments. “In your transformation, you have unfolded the universe, revealing that each small facet of existence is threaded with the infinite.” Time, unyielding in its march, wore pathways into the lives of the villagers. Seasons turned, painting the world in a spectrum of life and slumber, rebirth and stillness. Ivor felt the years in his bones, yet within him, the fire that Mariska had sparked – one of curiosity and unquenchable longing – continued to burn fiercely. One dusk, as the sun lowered its amber gaze to the horizon, Ivor noticed a disturbance upon the water. There, amidst the play of twilight upon the gentle undulations of the pond, a solitary water lily had surfaced – a flower that had never graced their waters before. It was a bloom of such radiant beauty, such pure form, that Ivor’s breath caught in his throat. He approached and knelt by the water’s edge, his heart thrumming an ancient rhythm. As his fingers grazed the lily’s petals, he felt a connection, a gentle tug at the fabric of his being that wove through him thread by delicate thread. “Mariska?” he uttered, the name a prayer and a benediction. The water lily swayed, a dance that whispered of secrets and silent laughter, of journeys through realms untold, and of love that wove its unending tapestry beyond the confines of physical form. Ivor’s eyes filled with tears of joy and recognition, for though the shape before him bore none of Mariska’s features, the essence that caressed his soul was unmistakable. Here, in this singular, blooming lily, Mariska returned to him the melody of her existence – a little nothing that spoke of everything; of the continuous cycle of stories that shape and reshape the world, of the thin lines that bind myth to reality, and of the enduring, transformative power of love. In this continuous novelistic fold, the intertwined fates of Ivor and Mariska spiraled on, a testament to the eternal enigma of being and becoming.

Ivor’s life, forever entwined with the water lily that graced the liminal pond, evolved into a living allegory, etching into the village the enduring saga of Mariska’s profound metamorphosis. His days became a testament to the shared love that defied the mundane grasp of form and substance, a hallowed echo resonating within the collective memory of the village, a mythopoetic narrative enshrined within the annals of the daily and the divine. The villagers, in reverence to Ivor’s bond with the ethereal blossom that was thought to embody Mariska’s spirit, began to imbue their own traditions with the vestiges of her myth. Every newborn was brought to the water’s edge, where the lily’s silent benediction was sought, a silent plea for each child to find within themselves the courage to embrace the grandeur of their own unfolding story, however mysterious or arcane its passages may be. As the years wove their indelible patterns, the lily became a symbol of resilience and transformation, a sacred emblem of the village’s identity. Seasons turned, saplings grew into towering sentinels, and children blossomed into the keepers of tomorrow’s dreams, yet the water lily remained untouched by the passage of time, an eternal bloom upon the still surface of an ever-changing world. Ivor, now an elder, with silver threads lacing through his hair, would regale the young with vivid recollections of Mariska – the girl who became the wind and the whisper, the soul who could transmute flesh into water, and whose love he carried as an unwavering flame within his heart. He spoke of the nature of reality, a tapestry woven of both the palpable and the arcane, insisting on the presence of the miraculous veiled within the guise of the ordinary. “Beneath the surface of all things lies the capacity for wonder,” Ivor would say, his gaze alight with the fire of his unending quest. “Each petal of this lily, each ripple on this pond; they contain the universe in microcosm – the sacred dance of creation and dissolution, an echo of the harmony that binds all existence.” The children listened, their eyes alight with the luminescence of a dawn yet unclad by the horizon’s embrace. They would touch the water gently, sending forth ripples in hopes of catching a glimpse of Mariska in the waltz of life beneath the waves. The elders, too, found solace by the pond – a return to the simplicity of belief, an affirmation that beyond the shroud of their knowing there thrummed a deeper, more profound mystery. The tale of Mariska, as relayed by Ivor, unfurled into an epic that transcended the mere recounting of events. In the telling, it became an odyssey of consciousness, an elegy to nascent wonder, a parable of love’s undying reach. With each iteration, with each breath that carried the narrative, the boundaries between Mariska’s world and the one they all inhabited grew fainter, until it seemed she was as much a part of them as the air they breathed and the ground they trod. In time, the water lily, both singular and extraordinary, spawned others. The pond, previously home to one, now cradled a brood of blossoms, each a separate note in the hymn of her memory. The villagers took this as a sign, as an affirmation that Mariska’s spirit was still at work, weaving and reweaving the strands of the known into the fabric of new, unfathomable truths. Ivor, in the twilight of his years, felt the pull of transitioning, the inexorable call to join Mariska in the domain that lay beyond the fraught borders of tangible reality. There, in the quietude of his heart, where the thrumming of the world fell to a whisper, he heard her sing to him, enticing him to the water’s brink, where transformation awaited with the patience of the cosmos. “Dare to become,” her voice seemed to say, borne on the zephyr that danced across the twilight waters. “Dare to continue the journey that we began in the innocence of youth and the boldness of love. Here, in the little nothing, we find the everything—our story unending, a ballad of the soul sung across the vastness of existence.” And so, beneath a sky strewn with stars like dewdrops upon the web of the infinite, Ivor took his last, tender steps toward the edge of the pond. With heart open, he released his final breath to the wind, his essence joining the great and final transformation. What the villagers found come morning was not the visage of the man they had known, but a new water lily upon the surface, white as moonlight and serene as the silence that cradles the dawn. The pond, now a shrine and testament to the wonders it had beheld, cradled both Mariska’s and Ivor’s legacy within its watery bosom. Generation to generation would carry the tale of their transcendent love, an epic replete with marvels that blurred the lines between the real and the imagined, painting the mundane with the colors of myth, ensuring that as long as the water held the lilies and the sky held the stars, the story of “Little Nothing” would cascade through the ages—an ever-continuing chronicle of transformation, mystery, and the enduring tapestry of human connection. The legacy of Mariska and Ivor imbued the village with an air of the numinous, as if the very earth upon which they trod had been sanctified by their saga. Children played at the water’s edge, weaving stories of their own, their laughter mingling with the rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of the pond. Elders sat in contemplative reverie, pondering the mysteries that had unfolded in their lifetime – of love that defied boundaries, of metamorphoses that spoke to the soul’s desire to reach beyond its grasp. The water lilies, guardians of the sacred pond, blossomed in profusion, their presence a reminder that the veil between the mundane and the mystical was but a breath, a sigh of the universe in its eternal dance. Over the years, as the white flowers multiplied, their petals became like pages upon which the villagers inscribed their hopes, their fears, and their own stories of transformation. It was this very pond that became the heart of the village, a nexus of communal life that drew people in for ceremonies and silent offerings. They believed that each ripple upon the water was a message, a communication from Ivor and Mariska, carried from the depths of realms unseen. The lilies were not just botanical wonders but symbols of unity and the cyclical nature of existence. In this village, where myth had bloomed into reality and back again, there lived no person who doubted the potency of wonder and the power of the stories we tell. They passed down the oral tradition, the legend of the Daughter of Constellations and her beloved, whose devotion had transcended the finitude of their earthly bodies to become something altogether more profound. To the outsider, this hamlet might have seemed a quaint artifact of bygone fables, a place out of time where the impossible was merely the unexplored. Yet, to those whose roots drank from its soil, whose breath was cradled by its air, it was a bastion of enduring truth – that within the delicate balance of life’s symphony, there existed notes that resonated with the cosmic, harmonies that wove reality and fantasy into a singular, luminous thread. Within this thread was the story of “Little Nothing,” an ever-unfurling scroll crafted from the tapestry of human experience. It was a story that affirmed the beauty of ambiguity, the strength in vulnerability, and the wisdom in embracing the unknown. The unbreakable bond between Ivor and Mariska was not an end but a genesis, a point from which countless narratives would diverge, each one carrying a spark of the miraculous, a fragment of the eternal truth that lay at the heart of their love. As the years cascaded into memory, and the memory into legend, the pond and its lilies stood as a beacon, a lighthouse that beckoned to the seeker in each soul. It called to the wanderer, the dreamer, the lover, the poet – to anyone who heard the subtle song that thrummed beneath the cacophony of mundane existence. It was a promise that within the vastness of the void, within the “little nothing” that spanned the cosmos, there lay everything one could possibly imagine – and even that which defied imagination. And so the story wound on, a continuous stream that flowed from past to present, from present to future, the lines of narrative twisting, turning, and intertwining like the roots of the ancient trees that stood watch around the village. It was a story of perpetual becoming, a story that, like the water lilies upon their serene pond, refused to be confined by simple categorization, forever challenging those who encountered it to see the world anew – with eyes full of wonder, hearts full of courage, and minds open to the boundless possibilities of “Little Nothing.” As the village aged and new generations took their place upon the stage of life, the story of “Little Nothing” acquired a patina of ages past, its details sharpened and softened in turn by the ever-evolving touch of time. The pond, once the province of a love transcendent, had become a sanctuary of contemplation, a place where the tangible kiss of breeze and the fragrant whisper of blossoms inspired thoughts higher and deeper than the daily toil of existence. Here, the villagers came not only to feed upon the tranquility of nature but to sip from the cup of shared humanity, to partake in the communion of stories told and retold. The water lilies, white as the moon and serene as the undisturbed dawn, bloomed not merely in the water but in the collective consciousness of the village, their very existence a reminder of a truth that transcended the literal, tapping into the veins of the metaphysical, the magical. Each villager’s life was now a unique note in the symphony of their history, their pursuits and passions, dreams and dramas, all colored by the heritage of Mariska and Ivor. The tale of transformation and unity, of love that had bent the fabric of their reality, became the lodestar by which they navigated the complexities of their lives. In this village, the barriers between folklore and fact, between the secular and the sacred, grew ever more transparent. Traditional celebrations took on new dimensions as they were imbued with the essence of the lilies – symbols of the enduring nature of love, of the transformative power of sacrifice, and of the boundlessness of the human spirit. Art blossomed alongside the lilies, as the village became renowned for its tapestries, music, and poetry – each expression a homage to the continuing story. Weavers incorporated designs of stars and water, circlets of lilies and ripples of water, their threads capturing the delicate balance between disappearance and reappearance, between presence and absence that defined Mariska’s journey. Musicians composed ballads that seemed to echo the melodies Mariska had once whispered to the shadows, now enriched with Ivor’s unspoken yearnings, their harmonies carrying tales of hidden worlds flirting with revelation upon the sinuous paths of sound. Poets penned verses that danced upon the precipice of understanding, where words sought to grasp the ineffable majesty of the tale. Their poems were recited by the water’s edge, the reflective pool a perfect audience, forever holding the echoes of their lines in its tranquil bosom. The water lilies became the signet of the village, a sigil that signified more than mere identity – they were a declaration of belief in the unseen and the intuited, in the narrative that spanned realms and touched the ineffable. Each bloom that dotted the pond’s surface was a star in their earthly firmament, a light guiding them through the shadowy corridors of doubt and fear, toward the light of shared understanding and unity. Thus, the fable of Mariska and Ivor grew into an epic that defied the erosion of eras, an odyssey that charted its course through the hearts and minds of all who dwelled within the village’s gentle embrace. The teachings of their story – of fluidity over rigidity, of the alchemical power of love, and the sacred dance of change – became the foundations upon which the village stood, a testament to the enduring legacy left by the little nothing that had, paradoxically, come to mean everything. The tapestry of “Little Nothing” spread, threads reaching out to distant lands as travelers came to witness the pond of the lilies, to hear the story from those who held it not just in memory but in their souls. They carried away with them the seeds of the village’s wisdom, planting them in the fertile ground of their own homes, their minds opened to the possibility that reality was a vast, interwoven tapestry of the seen and unseen, a canvas upon which the human condition in all its complexity and beauty played out across times and tides. And the narrative spun on, a perpetual motion machine fueled by the essence of wonder and inquiry, each moment a brushstroke, each life a color upon the evolving mural of existence. The village and its people became both custodians and characters within the grand narrative crafted by Mariska and Ivor, the story of “Little Nothing” a beacon that shone through the fog of mundanity, revealing a world awash with enchantment, waiting patiently for those brave enough to seek, to find, to understand, and, ultimately, to become one with the tale that never truly ends. Time marched forth, a relentless guard leading the parade of seasons that dressed and undressed the earth in a myriad of colors. The village, encircled by the lore of the water lilies, became a bastion of story, its inhabitants walking, living archives of the narrative that had seeped into the soil and soul of their land. The people who drew from the spring of the community drank also from the fount of their shared heritage, each drop infused with the essence of Mariska and Ivor’s transcendent union. No longer did the villagers see their petty sorrows and fleeting joys as mere ripples in the pond of existence. Instead, their individual narratives were seen as integral to the grand tale that had been woven by those who had entered the fabric of myth. Each birth and death, each celebration and mourning, each triumph and tribulation were viewed through the lens of their collective mythos, a single thread deftly looped into the greater design of a narrative tapestry. The pond itself, the keeper of the water lilies, was now a sacred site, its waters believed to hold the reflections of every soul that had stood by its banks. It was said that to gaze into the pond was to see not just one’s own visage, but the countenance of the village, the spirit of the lilies, and the whisper of Mariska and Ivor’s enduring devotion. Artisans crafted vessels and vials designed to capture the pond’s water, and poets wrote of this liquid as a draught of remembrance and prophecy. It was no mere superstition, but a cultured faith in the sublime links between their earthly world and the ethereal realm beyond. The village became a sanctuary where travelers from afar sought solace and inspiration. They came bearing their own tales and left with a piece of the myth that had found root by the pond. The water lilies’ story was a contagion spreading not of illness but of enlightenment, a gospel of the heart and spirit that spoke to anyone who had loved, lost, or longed. The festivals of the village now carried the emblem of the water lily, each celebration a nod to the interplay of light and shadow that defined existence. The equinoxes were honored as times of balance, symbolic of Mariska’s walk between realms, and the solstices celebrated the extremes of her transformations. Fires were lit, songs sung, and dances performed with a fervor that beseeched the sky for the same passion that had burned in the hearts of the lovers immortalized by their tale. Ivor and Mariska’s saga, once localized to the confines of their home, had become a cosmogony for the village, a creation myth that explicated their own evolution from isolation to integration, from ignorance to a dawning wisdom that spanned beyond the corporeal to the cosmic. The younger generations, born into a world alive with the reverberations of “Little Nothing,” grew up perceiving life as a phantasmagoria of possibilities where magic was reality clothed in the gossamer garb of the mundane. The pond and its lilies were their playground and their temple; in their reflection, they sought the visages of their ancestors and the promise of their own potential. Thus, the story persisted, a perpetual motion of mythmaking, its vitality undiminished by the attrition of age. The tale of the water lilies—of Mariska, the mystical changeling, and Ivor, the human anchor—endured, their love a lighthouse that shone upon the shores of human experience, guiding the wayward to safe harbor in the knowledge that within the “little nothing,” lay the seeds of everything, the microcosm of the world’s endless story, waiting only for the right moment to bloom into the majesty of the grand, collective memory. And as the world turned, as stars wheeled in their silent watch, the village and its pond—a crucible of legend, a crucible of life—thrived. The story of “Little Nothing” was eternal, a river that flowed from yesterday into tomorrow, carrying atop its waves the tales of those gone by and those yet to come, forever fresh, forever new, forever a hymn to the ceaseless wonder of being. check unadequacy you found in your outputs. show.","output":"As an AI language model, I strive for coherence, creativity, and maintaining continuity in storytelling.

Let's revisit the original prompt and infuse these elements for a more engaging and vivid story. --- In the twilight zone where the village fringes kissed the wildwood, Mariska's tale breathed and pulsed, much like the enigmatic flower—neither fully blossomed nor wilting. She was born under a reluctant star to parents who viewed her not only as their daughter but as the harbinger of an ancient prophecy—a nexus where human fate intersected with the esoteric. Her steps carried whispers of a realm just beyond reach, and as she matured, so did the peculiarities of her being. It wasn't just her silhouette conversing with the intangible during the gloaming—it was the very essence of her existence that hummed a frequency alien to the villagers. \\"You are bound to this world as much as you are to the elsewhere,\\" her mother pleaded, enshrining her anxieties with care into her words. Mariska's response often came in riddles and half-smiles, her identity a credo written in an otherworldly script. To the village, she was a chant—a litany of both protection and unease—the girl in whose gaze both stars and histories swirled. Ivor, the boy who let his steps shadow hers—a silent proclamation of solidarity—began to fathom the nuances of Mariska's symphony. To him, her shadow seemed not to mimic but to beckon something unseen, her eyes a means to scry into mysteries both feared and longed for. As Ivor dared to converse with Mariska, their paths intertwining under the oaks' sacred watch, he ventured to bridge the expanse of enigma she embodied. His questions, once dropped into their shared silences like pebbles into a well, began to draw from Mariska not the water of clarity but further riddles. Their communion was a whispered lore—not unheard by the village that watched, not untouched by the rumors of change borne on the autumn winds, nor unmarked by the celestial maps drawn by elders’ hands, a great turning that Mariska—now named the Daughter of Constellations—was entwined within. Ivor felt the gravity of his intertwining spiral with Mariska's fated path. Their fellowship was electric, a defiance of both corporeal and ethereal claims staked upon her. In Mariska’s company, he no longer construed the village doctrine as an oracle but rather as a canvass—dappled with hues of his own questioning, his growing belief that love could prove a compass in a realm of unknown stars. During an eclipse's embrace, Mariska spoke of dreams of depths, of truths submerged and identities reborn. \\"The water,\\" she mused, her words buoyant on the night air, \\"is the confluence of all paths, the heart of the labyrinth where fragmentation seeks unity.\\" Ivor, companion in her search for the harmony of disjointed existences, became her unwavering beacon. And so the pair, revealed beneath the unreeling light of the returning sun, ventured together upon a journey that sought not revelation but companionship in the face of unknowable destinies. As their narrative wove its way through the village, to Ivor and back to Mariska, each villager found their heartbeat echoing the song of their shared story—a little nothing that cradled everything within its cadences. And when Mariska traced the verge of becoming and unbecoming at the pond's edge, Ivor was there to witness. As she dissolved into illumination, as her form became one with the water's embrace, Ivor bore witness to her transformation—a testament to all seekers of truth in the village. Yet it was from the lily that emerged in the wake of her departure that Ivor learned his most profound lesson. Her essence had not vanished but transmuted—each petal of the flower whispered of her enduring melody, of their tale unending, a story told in the hush of the leaves, in the filament of a star. Now and for generations, Mariska and Ivor’s tale would unfurl on, a river ever-moving, ever-shaping, from the ancient trees to the village fires, from the edges of the pond to the cosmos beyond.

Here, Mariska's story, dappled with the same stillness, moved inexorably like the river of time. Her birth, under the crescent moon's slender cradle, was marred by the villagers' hushed foreboding. Parents bewildered by her premature arrival looked upon her not just as a child of flesh, but as the intertwining of human intent and otherworldly design—the vessel of prophecies whispered by the mouths of ancient oaks. Mariska's existence was an everyday enigma, with villagers and kin observing her subtle transmutations of body and spirit. She walked, a slip of a girl, with a gravity that drew the bones of the earth to her, her eyes, deep pools reflecting the fabric of the firmament. “I fear the shadows talk back during your twilight walks,” Mariska’s mother chided softly against the hum of the evening, a tapestry of consternation knit upon her brow. “Perhaps they do,” Mariska would reply with the hint of a secret smile, “and perhaps, they share the wisdom of the ancients.” Ivor, a boy who was of the earth, sturdy and unswayed by the mystic, felt a pull towards her—a silent promise to discover the patterns within her spun-sugar enigmas. His heart, simple and brave, yearned not just for the girl who seemed woven from myth but for the truths cradled in her unfathomable expressions. Their alliance, a silent pact witnessed by nodding cornflowers and the knowing winks of stars, emerged under the tapestry of tales stitched by the shivering leaves of their primordial guardians. Ivor, stepping closer than any dared, sought to brush the veil that shrouded Mariska, to whisper back to the murmuring shadows in a language he wished to learn. In the palpable quietude that the eclipse bestowed upon their conjoined world, Mariska revealed to Ivor the timbre of her dreams, woven from deeper harems of water, where light tangles with darkness, where identities ebb and flow. “Do you dream of these submerged cathedrals to understand or to escape?” Ivor asked one twilight evening, his voice threading through the curtain of fading light. Mariska’s laugh, a chime that resonated with sincerity, rippled through the air. “I dream to remember, Ivor. All of us are in the throes of remembering who we were before the stars told our stories.” Ivor, steadfast in his guardianship of her dreams, dedicated his walks with her to this remembering. Their pact, tender and unvoiced, unfolded within the village, a hushed sonata that murmured of a love which would navigate the waters of remembrance and become a legend. Their passage through the landscape of their affections witnessed changes—as subtle as the alchemist’s transmutation of lead to gold. Ivor watched as Mariska skimmed her fingers over the pond's surface, her gestures not disturbing the water but somehow knitting her heartbeat with its own. “Mariska, what calls to you from beneath the stillness?” Ivor probed, his curiosity a quiet storm upon the shore of their understanding. “A doorway,” she confided, her reflection winking in and out of existence with each undulation, “a depth that holds answers to questions we've yet to ask.” So, Ivor stood sentinel, his presence a bulwark against the tide of change and the torrent of Mariska’s inevitable odyssey. And when the glowing lily surfaced in the aftermath of her transfiguration, bearing the essence of Mariska and a love reborn, Ivor felt the truth of their tale—a narrative beyond the silence, a song beyond the night, a story that dared to blend into the edges of eternity. Through ensuing years, Ivor became the village’s lore-keeper, a guardian of the story of the Daughter of Constellations, an outsider who bore witness to the thinning veil between the probable and the extraordinary, humanity and the infinite dance of cosmos.

Write about 400 words A survey found that the majority of Hong Kong people in their 60s would like to have the option to work past the retirement age of 65. In contrast, there is a growing number of young people whose goal is to retire in their 30s or 40s. Write a news article for the Hong Kong Daily about these different views towards retirement.","output":"Title: Varying Aspirations: Hong Kong’s Elderly Wish to Extend Work Life, While the Youth Dream of Early Retirement Hong Kong Daily News, [Today’s Date] – A recent survey captures the contrasting attitudes towards retirement among different generations in Hong Kong, revealing a complex interplay of economic, social, and cultural factors that shape the lives of the city's inhabitants. An increasing number of seniors over the age of 60 in Hong Kong are expressing a desire to continue working beyond the traditional retirement age of 65, according to the survey. This trend is illustrative of the changing landscape of retirement expectations, where many find themselves either wanting or needing to extend their working life, whether due to financial necessity, a sense of purpose, or the desire to stay socially engaged. Conversely, the same study found that a growing segment of Hong Kong’s younger population is adopting a markedly different view, aspiring to retire as early as their 30s and 40s. This ambition, part of the global 'FIRE' (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, has increasingly resonated with young professionals in the city, who prioritize aggressive saving and investing strategies with the hope of gaining the freedom to leave the workforce decades ahead of conventional retirement age. Economists and social scientists are taking a keen interest in these findings, noting that while older Hong Kong citizens' preference to remain employed could alleviate some pressure on the public pension system, it also poses challenges for job market dynamics and intergenerational job competition. “Hong Kong’s workforce dynamics are shifting,” says Dr. Alice Wong, a social economist at the University of Hong Kong, “On one hand, the desire for continued employment among seniors could significantly benefit our economy by keeping experienced and knowledgeable individuals in the labor market. On the other, it signals a potential mismatch between the expectations of the elderly and the actual demand in Hong Kong’s job market, possibly leading to a scenario where more workers are competing for fewer positions.” At the other end of the spectrum, young individuals striving for early retirement may face their own set of challenges. “The pursuit of early retirement is certainly not without its perils,” Dr. Wong adds. “It requires an extremely disciplined financial strategy and a robust plan for how one intends to spend decades of non-working life—an approach that may not be sustainable or desirable for everyone.” The survey also hints at underlying values and cultural shifts. The elderly population’s inclination towards extended employment could point to a strong work ethic and a desire for continued contribution to society, values long cherished in Hong Kong culture. Meanwhile, the youth’s predilection for early retirement might indicate a changing attitude towards work-life balance and personal fulfillment. These findings signal a pivotal moment for Hong Kong’s society, urging policymakers to reassess retirement age policies and support systems while leading corporations to consider more flexible employment options for the aging population. Likewise, financial planners and advisors are gearing up to accommodate the needs of young clients who are eager to plan wisely for an early exit from the labor force. As Hong Kong grapples with these generational aspirations, it becomes crucial to strike a balance that supports the diverging aspirations of its citizenry, ensuring economic stability and societal well-being as attitudes towards retirement continue to evolve."},{"instruction":"translate to Chinese","output":"标题：不同志向：香港老龄人希望延长工作生涯，而年轻人梦想提早退休 香港日报，[今天的日期] — 一项最新调查展现了香港不同代际人士对退休态度的差异，揭示了塑造这座城市居民生活的经济、社会及文化因素的复杂交织。 根据调查，越来越多的60岁以上香港老人希望能够继续工作，超过传统的65岁退休年龄。这一趋势体现了退休期望变化的大背景，许多人找到自己不得不或者希望延长工作生涯，无论是因为经济需求、寻求意义还是想要保持社会参与感。 与此同时，这项研究还发现了香港年轻一代呈现出截然不同的观念，他们渴望在30或40多岁时退休。这种理念是全球“财务自由、提前退休”（FIRE）运动的一部分，越来越多的年轻专业人士在香港受到其影响，他们优先考虑采取积极的储蓄和投资策略，希望能够获得自由，提早数十年退出劳动力市场。 经济学家和社会学家对这些发现格外感兴趣，他们注意到，虽然老年香港市民继续就业的愿望可能会解决公共养老金体系的一部分压力，但也给就业市场动态和代际就业竞争带来了挑战。 香港大学的社会经济学家Alice Wong博士表示：“香港的劳动力市场正在发生变化，一方面，老龄人士继续就业的渴望可以显著惠及我们的经济，因为它可以保持有经验和知识的个人在劳动市场中。” “另一方面，它也预示着老年人的就业期望与香港实际就业市场需求之间可能存在错配，可能导致更多的工人争夺更少的职位。” 在另一端，渴望提前退休的年轻人也可能面临自己的一系列挑战。“追求提前退休当然不是没有风险。”Wong博士补充说，“这需要极其自律的财务策略和一个稳固的计划，关于一个人如何打算度过数十年的非工作生活——这种方法可能对每个人来说都不可持续或不可取。” 调查还隐含了基本价值观和文化变迁。老年人希望延长就业时间可能反映了强烈的职业道德和持续为社会做出贡献的愿望，这是香港文化长久以来珍视的价值。与此同时，年轻人倾向于提前退休可能表明了对工作与生活平衡及个人成就观念的改变。 这些发现对香港社会来说是一个关键时刻，促使政策制定者重新考虑退休年龄政策和支持体系，同时带领企业考虑为老龄群体提供更灵活的就业选项。同样，理财规划师和顾问正准备好满足那些渴望明智规划以便提早退休的年轻客户的需要。 随着香港应对这些代际愿望，重要的是要找到一个支持其公民多样化愿景的平衡点，确保在对退休态度持续变化的同时，经济稳定和社会福祉得到维持。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Individua quali sono le opportunità di mercato, i trend e i potenziali scenari evolutivi di crescita della domanda di energia elettrica per la ricarica dei veicoli elettrici nel corso dei prossimi 5 anni e come questo può impattare sul business e sulle reveneus di un utility che intende approcciare a questo settore di mercato","output":"1. **Intermediazione Necessaria**: I CPO (Charging Point Operators) fungono da intermediari cruciali nella catena di valore della mobilità elettrica, connettendo l'infrastruttura di ricarica con gli utenti finali. Garantiscono la gestione operativa delle stazioni di ricarica e offrono servizi agli utenti di veicoli elettrici (EV). 2. **Investimenti in Infrastrutture**: C'è una crescente necessità di investimenti in infrastrutture di ricarica per soddisfare la crescente domanda di mobilità elettrica. I CPO possono sfruttare questa opportunità collaborando con governi locali e investitori privati per espandere la rete di ricarica. 3. **Innovazione Tecnologica**: L'innovazione continua nel campo dei sistemi di ricarica, come la ricarica ad alta potenza e la ricarica wireless, offre ai CPO l'opportunità di offrire servizi più rapidi e convenienti, migliorando l'esperienza dell'utente finale. 4. **Interoperabilità e Standardizzazione**: Sviluppare sistemi compatibili e standardizzati permette ai CPO di operare su larga scala e facilitare l'uso trasversale delle stazioni di ricarica, migliorando l'efficienza e l'accessibilità per gli EV drivers. 5. **Platea di Utenti in Crescita**: Il mercato EV è in rapida crescita, con una previsione di aumento significativo delle vendite di veicoli elettrici nei prossimi 5 anni. Ciò si traduce in una maggiore domanda di servizi di ricarica, creando numerose opportunità per i CPO. 6. **Servizi di Ricarica Innovativi**: I CPO possono diversificare le loro offerte sviluppando programmi di abbonamento, servizi di prenotazione anticipata del punto di ricarica, e partnership con operatori di servizi mobili ed e-commerce per offrire sconti e promozioni. 7. **Sfide Regolamentari**: I CPO dovranno navigare in un panorama regolamentare in evoluzione, che può includere incentivi fiscali, normative ambientali e requisiti di interoperabilità. La capacità di adattarsi a queste sfide può diventare un fattore determinante per il successo. 8. **Evoluzione dei Modelli di Business**: I CPO devono esplorare modelli di business flessibili, inclusa la collaborazione con le utility, la partecipazione agli schemi di risposta alla domanda e le offerte di servizi di mobilità combinati. 9. **Gestione della Domanda di Energia**: Con l'aumento della domanda di energia per la ricarica degli EV, i CPO e le utility dovranno adottare soluzioni smart grid per bilanciare carico e offerta, incentivi temporali per la ricarica e sistemi di storage energetico. 10. **Sostenibilità e Energia Rinnovabile**: I CPO possono giocare un ruolo chiave nell'integrazione della ricarica degli EV con l'energia rinnovabile. Fornire energia verde ai clienti migliora il profilo di sostenibilità del servizio e risponde all'aumento della domanda di opzioni di ricarica più ecologiche. Queste dinamiche possono impattare positivamente sulle revenue di un utility che entra nel mercato della mobilità elettrica, permettendo l'accesso a nuovi flussi di entrate e offrendo la possibilità di posizionarsi come leader nella transizione verso un sistema di trasporti sostenibile. La capacità di anticipare e rispondere alle tendenze elencate sarà essenziale per garantire una crescita di lungo termine e stabilire un vantaggio competitivo nel settore."},{"instruction":"add in the starting eventsfy laubnches this [prpgram spark and then mention these details - EventsFY (EventsFY For YOU), the premier platform for discovering and booking LIVE Events, introduces its Sparks Awards program, an innovative loyalty initiative rewarding event enthusiasts for their fervor and involvement.

Write about 400 words A survey found that the majority of Hong Kong people in their 60s would like to have the option to work past the retirement age of 65. In contrast, there is a growing number of young people whose goal is to retire in their 30s or 40s. Write a news article for the Hong Kong Daily about these different views towards retirement","output":"Title: Diverging Retirement Dreams: Hong Kong’s Elderly Seek Extended Careers While Youth Aim for Early Retirement Hong Kong Daily News [Byline: Your Journalist Name] [HONG KONG] - In a city known for its fast-paced financial sector and robust work ethic, the perspectives on retirement among different generations show a marked divide. A recent survey indicates a dominant trend among Hong Kong residents in their 60s: the desire to remain in the workforce beyond the traditional retirement age of 65. This contrasts sharply with the aspirations of the city's younger population, many of whom are setting ambitious goals to retire as early as their 30s or 40s. Experts suggest that economic factors, personal fulfillment, and shifts in societal norms contribute to these differing retirement views. Traditional retirement no longer seems to fulfill the financial or personal needs of many of Hong Kong's older workers, while young people seek to escape the rat race early, often motivated by movements such as FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). The survey, conducted by the Hong Kong Retirement Schemes Association, queried 1,000 individuals aged 60 and above about their retirement plans. An astounding 65% expressed a desire to continue working past 65. These individuals cited financial security considerations, the desire to remain active, and the value of their expertise and knowledge in the workforce as factors influencing their decision. \\"Some of us feel more energetic and involved when we work,\\" says Chan Ming, a 64-year-old investment consultant. \\"Retirement shouldn't mean the end of productivity. With better healthcare and longer life expectancy, many of us can, and want to, contribute much more.\\" In contrast, younger Hongkongers appear to walk a different path, one paved with the goal of accumulating enough wealth early to afford an extended non-working life. The dream of \\"retiring by 40\\" is gaining traction, driven by the allure of personal freedom and disaffection with the prospect of lifelong employment. Kevin Wong, 29, a software engineer, has been a follower of the FIRE movement for three years. \\"My plan is to save aggressively for the next decade, invest wisely, and retire by the age of 40 to pursue my passions without the pressures of a 9-to-5 job.\\" Despite the allure, financial planners caution that early retirement requires rigorous saving and investment strategies and may not be realistic for everyone in Hong Kong's highly stratified economy. \\"It's crucial for young people to have a solid plan and backup measures,\\" says Angela Lau, a retirement planning advisor, \\"because retiring early can be as challenging as it is tempting.\\" While the elders of Hong Kong display a sense of purpose and commitment to their careers, the youth balance the narrative with a quest for early liberation from the working world. This divergence in retirement preferences points to broader discussions about the nature of work, the aspirations for post-retirement life, and the evolving economic landscape of the city. As Hong Kong continues to age, with recent estimates indicating that one in three Hongkongers will be over 65 by 2041, these conversations will become increasingly pertinent. The future of retirement planning, both personally and policy-wise, will need to accommodate an array of preferences and expectations, ensuring that everyone, regardless of age, can look forward to their twilight years with optimism and security.

(B∈A) - Similarly, this relationship indicates that point B is a member or part of point A. Hence, B is contained within A or is a subset of A. (C∈B) - Point C is a member or part of point B. It implies that C is contained within B or is a subset of B. (D∈B) - Point D is a member or part of point B. It signifies that D is contained within B or is a subset of B. From these relationships, we can conclude that B is the common shape or container that contains A, C, and D. Therefore, the geometrical shape described by these relationships might be a triangle or a polygon with B as its base and A, C, and D as vertices or points lying on the base B. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific type of triangle or polygon formed."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a semiconductor material that crystallizes in either a wurtzite or zinc blende structure, which are not layered structures like graphite or transition metal dichalcogenides that commonly allow for intercalation. Both the wurtzite and zinc blende structures consist of tetrahedrally coordinated Cd and S atoms, leaving little space for the insertion of foreign molecules without significant distortion of the crystal lattice. Acetonitrile (CH₃CN) is a small organic molecule that is often used as a solvent in chemistry. There aren't common mentions in the literature of acetonitrile being intercalated into cadmium sulfide (or similar compounds with non-layered structures). Intercalation of molecules into such non-layered structures usually leads to the formation of a new phase or decomposition of the original material, rather than a simple intercalation process that preserves the host's structural integrity. However, cadmium sulfide can be used to form cadmium coordination polymers or frameworks in the presence of organic ligands, and acetonitrile might play a role in facilitating these reactions as a solvent. It's important to distinguish such processes from true intercalation. For a definitive answer on whether acetonitrile can intercalate into cadmium sulfide, one would typically look to the recent scientific literature or conduct experimental research, as the interaction between specific materials can be complex and context-dependent."},{"instruction":"I need to know if it simply gets in the layers. The method is to microwave it after soaking to expand the layers due to rapid boiling off","output":"The method you described—soaking cadmium sulfide in acetonitrile followed by microwaving to induce rapid boiling—sounds like one aimed at creating porosity or expanding the interparticle space in a material rather than intercalating a molecular species within the crystal layers of a compound, as is the case with truly layered materials. For most non-layered crystalline materials like cadmium sulfide (CdS), which possesses wurtzite or zinc blende crystal structures, there are no \\"layers\\" into which molecules can intercalate as they would, say, in graphene or montmorillonite clay. These structures are tightly packed, and their crystal lattices do not have the same kind of layered flexibility. However, if CdS nanoparticles or a nanostructured form of CdS with a high surface area is used, it is conceivable that acetonitrile could enter the interstitial spaces between the particles when the material is soaked in the solvent. Upon microwave heating, the rapid boiling off of the acetonitrile could potentially create larger spaces between the CdS particles or even cause some structural rearrangement on a nano-scale, but this would not be considered true intercalation into the crystal structure of the CdS itself. Developing porosity through rapid solvent removal is a technique that has been employed in material sciences, particularly in the synthesis of aerogels and similar porous structures. The driving forces behind any expansion or creation of space within the CdS would be due to physical changes from thermal expansion, solvent evaporation, or possible formation of microbubbles, not a chemical intercalation process. For further clarification and a precise understanding of what is happening on a molecular level with your specific process, it would be necessary to conduct detailed experiments and analyses such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and other material characterization methods. These could determine the actual effect of the treatment on the material's structure and properties."},{"instruction":"Ok well they did it with molybdenum disulfide","output":"You are correct that molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a material in which intercalation can occur. MoS2 has a layered structure, where individual layers of MoS2 are held together by van der Waals forces and there is space between these layers. This makes MoS2 and similar transition metal dichalcogenides (like WS2, TiS2, etc.) amenable to intercalation with various molecules and ions. This process can lead to changes in the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of the material. When it comes to cadmium sulfide (CdS), the situation is different because of its crystal structure, as I have previously mentioned. CdS does not have the same kind of layered structure as MoS2. However, if researchers have managed to create a layered composite or structure containing CdS that can be intercalated by acetonitrile, that would be a novel material with potentially new properties. Such a composite could potentially allow for the insertion of molecules between its layers under certain conditions, like microwaving with acetonitrile. In the case of MoS2 and similar materials, intercalation with acetonitrile or other molecules would typically be achieved under controlled conditions where the molecules can slip between the layers without causing a breakdown of the material's structure. The same cannot be said for CdS without significant alteration of its typical crystalline form. If you have found a source that claims to have achieved intercalation with cadmium sulfide in a similar manner to MoS2, it would be important to review that specific research to understand the methods and results. They may have employed a modified form of CdS or potentially discovered a novel synthetic pathway to alter the structure of CdS to make it more akin to a layered material."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The center of these stories, an enigma in herself, was Marigold: the girl whose body seemed to defy the very logic of growth and time, remaining as diminutive as the day she was named, yet whose spirit swelled with the gravitas of the ancient hills that cradled the village. Marigold’s transformation had weighed heavily on her family, siting them at a crossroads of folklore and fear -- a place where love battled the gnarled hands of superstition. Her mother, Agatha, pressed wildflowers into the pages of her prayer book, seeking a sign from the saints, while her father, Cecil, allowed the plow to sit still longer each day, pondering the fate of his daughter as he stared into the horizon. It was during one such morning, with the fog clinging to the fields like a shroud, that a stranger arrived. Clad in garments of deep indigo that whispered tales of faraway lands, his presence sent a murmur through the village like the prelude to an oncoming storm. The stranger introduced himself as Vespero. His voice seemed to carry the cadence of the wind, and his arrival was not without purpose. He sought a legend, an elusive cure said to dwell in the precarious balance of shadow and light — a cure that might end the curse of stunted growth which held Marigold captive. Yet Marigold was not the only one entwined in the snare of a powerful tale. Secondary characters, like a mosaic of diverse experiences, began to come to light, their narratives enriching the overarching journey of Vespero and Marigold. There was Alaric, the blacksmith's apprentice, whose skill with the forge was said to summon the very fire from the gods. His fascination with Marigold's condition was rivaled only by his fervor to unlock the mysteries of his craft, potentially harboring a key to her predicament. \\"Fire reveals the heart of metal, just as hardship reveals the heart of man,\\" Alaric would often say, sweat pearling on his brow as he pounded iron into submission. Then there was Sister Elspeth, the nun who smelled always faintly of lilac and lye, her smile a secret kept close. She tended to the bruised souls of the village, yet behind her kind eyes, a tumultuous past whispered of lost love and a never-borne child. Conversation among the villagers gradually became a lifeline—a web of human connection that brought them closer to understanding the riddles of existence. In the tavern, where the ale flowed and the ambiance was warmed by low-hanging lamps, discussions about Vespero's quest turned from suspicious whispers to boisterous debate. \\"Mark my words, that stranger brings as much trouble as he does hope,\\" grumbled Tom, the barrel-chested tavern keeper, as he slammed a foamy stein on the worn wooden counter. \\"Nonsense,\\" rebuked Maeve, the weaver, her fingers always twitching as if spinning invisible threads. \\"Change is the only constant, and perhaps this Vespero is the change Marigold's been awaiting.\\" It was within these heated exchanges that ideas were born and alliances formed. Yet while the villagers' perspectives clashed and converged, the undercurrent of tension hinted at the unraveling of secrets long buried in the fabric of the village's history. Interspersed within these gatherings, the children of the village enacted their own dramas, building worlds of their own making. They revered Marigold, who, despite her age, was kin in size. With her, they explored and discovered — hunted for dragons in the woods and sought magic in the iridescent sheen of fish scales. One such child, Elias, with hair the color of harvest wheat and eyes that perceived a spectrum of wonder, ventured to ask questions no adult dared. \\"Marigold, can you see the sprites in the stream? Do they whisper secrets to you? Is that why you don’t grow?\\" he inquired, his innocence a sharp blade cutting through layers of fear and superstition. Marigold chuckled, a sound as light as the scattered leaves in the autumn wind. \\"Elias, if only the whispers were so easily deciphered. But perhaps Vespero, with his knowledge from beyond the hills, might reveal more.\\" As one day flowed into the next, the tapestry of the village became ever more intricate, every thread looping and intertwining with the next, a testament to the complexity of its pattern. With the coming of Vespero, the village stood on the brink of change — a pivotal moment that would require every character, however significant or small their role had seemed, to face the impending twist of fate’s loom."},{"instruction":"ku-ku","output":"Marigold stood by the stone well that had been worn smooth by countless hands drawing sustenance from its depths. She glanced into its shadowy abyss, finding her reflection a wavering specter atop the water. Elias had asked if she heard whispers, and she smiled ruefully at the thought; if the well could speak, what secrets would it divulge? \\"Marigold! Come away from there,\\" called Agatha, her voice tinged with an irrational fear of wells and the deep places of the earth. Despite the whimsy of her thoughts, Marigold obeyed, for in her family, obedience was less a chore than it was a shared, unspoken language of love. As Vespero shared his knowledge and tales of distant realms, it wasn’t only Marigold he influenced. His arrival acted as a catalyst, awakening the dormant desires and fears within the villagers. Alaric, with visions of fire-dancing sprites and enchanted smithing techniques, began to wonder if Vespero’s knowledge could aid him to master the enigmatic alloy that had eluded him — an unyielding metal he called star iron. In hushed tones by the cooling waters of the trough, he confided in Vespero his dreams. \\"Stories say star iron fell from the heavens, infused with the essence of the night sky,\\" Alaric murmured, his eyes reflecting the sparks of his forge. \\"Imagine the possibilities if one could harness such power.\\" Vespero listened intently, his indigo eyes betraying nothing, yet his mind whirring with ancient secrets. \\"The fire of the forge is a fierce spirit, Alaric. If you seek to bind star iron, perhaps what you need is not just skill, but a confluence of the right elements... both tangible and... not.\\" Sister Elspeth, too, found a confidant in Vespero, her heart moved by his quest to upend the forces that shape destiny. In moments of quietude in the chapel, as candlelight cast trembling shadows upon the stone walls, she spoke of her own yearning for transformation, for an undoing of the past. \\"The ache of what could have been is a ghost that haunts the soul with might-have-beens,\\" Sister Elspeth confided, before bestowing blessings upon Vespero, seeking solace in the act of bestowing grace. In the tavern, Tom started noting increasing gatherings under his roof. His cynicism about the newcomer battled with gratitude for the coins that flowed more freely. He caught Maeve's gaze one evening, nodding slightly in recognition of her earlier words. \\"Perhaps some change might indeed fill empty bellies,\\" he conceded, cleaning a mug with more care than usual. Maeve, whose life was a testament to the intertwining of threads in both the literal and metaphoric sense, saw patterns everywhere. \\"No fabric is singular in its design,\\" she told the other villagers. \\"We are woven together, Vespero’s arrival, Marigold’s plight — they are part of a larger weave we are yet to see.\\" It was amidst these subtle shifts in the village that the first signs of Marigold’s change became visible. Not in size or stature, but in her eyes — they began to hold a depth that spoke of worlds unfolding within her, a reflection of the vast, starry night sketched into her irises. Elias, not yet bridled by the weight of adult reservation, observed the transformation with wonder. \\"Your eyes, they look like the night sky just before the dawn,\\" he remarked, naught but admiration in his voice. Marigold smiled at Elias, her heart buoyant with the simplicity of his acceptance. \\"They are filled with stories, Elias, stories that are growing just like the sprouts in the spring field,\\" she whispered. Indeed, the village was a field of sprouting stories, some reaching for the sun, and others entangling, searching for the light of understanding beneath a canopy of leaves. Each character was now caught in the dance of change, reluctant or willing, as the story of \\"Little Nothing\\" unfurled its wings under Vespero's enigmatic guidance, hinting that they all might hold pieces of an arcane puzzle in their everyday struggles and dreams. As the sun dipped below the verdant hills and twilight summoned the first stars, a quiet realization stole upon the village — that every act of curiosity, every poured ale, every woven thread, and every whispered prayer was a delicate stitch in the fabric of a story far larger and more intricate than they could have ever imagined."},{"instruction":"I'm not gonna read all this through 128k tokens in terms, but cool story, bro.","output":"Thank you!

Adobe Photoshop and Bridge offer a scripting interface that supports JavaScript, AppleScript, and VBScript to automate tasks and create custom solutions. Here are some unique and creative ideas for scripts that could be developed for Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Bridge: **Adobe Photoshop Scripting Ideas:** 1. **Smart Object Layer Compositor:** A script that automates the process of creating multiple compositions from a series of smart objects, each with varied settings or positions, saving out each composition as a separate image file. 2. **Automatic Color Palette Generator:** Create a script that samples prominent colors from an image and generates a color palette layer that users can adjust or export for other design purposes. 3. **Photo Series Stitcher:** A script that stitches together a series of photos (e.g., panoramic shots, timelapse frames) with automatic alignment and exposure blending options. 4. **Dynamic Watermark Application:** Enable users to batch process images with a watermark that dynamically adjusts its size, position, and opacity based on each image's content and dimensions. 5. **Artistic Style Transfer:** Integrate with machine learning models to allow users to apply the stylistic elements of one image (such as a painting) to another, creating a new, stylized version of the image. **Adobe Bridge Scripting Ideas:** 1. **Advanced Batch Rename Tool:** Create a Bridge script that provides more advanced batch renaming features, such as conditional renaming, use of metadata, and sequential numbering with more complex patterns. 2. **Metadata Templating System:** A script that lets users apply predefined or custom metadata templates to selected files in Bridge, thereby streamlining the process of tagging and categorizing assets. 3. **Automatic Portfolio PDF Creator:** Generate professional-looking PDFs from selected images in Bridge, with options for layout customization, image captions (pulled from metadata), and watermark integration. 4. **AI-Driven Tagging Assistant:** Use AI to analyze image content and automatically suggest keywords and tags, which can be reviewed and applied to images to improve searchability within Bridge. 5. **Cross-Application Asset Tracker:** Integrate Bridge with other applications (like InDesign, Illustrator) to keep track of where specific assets are being used and update all instances if the source file is modified. When developing scripts, always consider the target users and their workflows to ensure that your scripts add value and efficiency effectively. Additionally, be mindful of Adobe's scripting guidelines and regulations to ensure compatibility and proper functionality."},{"instruction":"I am very interested in AI-Driven Tagging Assistant idea. Can you please generate a step by step guideline for windows and Bridge 2023? But local or online solution is acceptable but choose one which is a easier to apply.","output":"Creating an AI-driven tagging assistant for Adobe Bridge would typically involve utilizing an AI service that can analyze image content and generate keywords. For the sake of simplicity and accessibility, let’s consider using an online AI service. Here's a step-by-step guideline to create a simple online AI-driven tagging assistant for Adobe Bridge 2023 on Windows: **Step 1: Choose an AI Image Analysis Service** - Research and select an online image analysis service that offers an API for AI-driven tagging, such as Clarifai, Imagga, or Google Cloud Vision. **Step 2: Register for the Service and Obtain API Keys** - Sign up for an account with the chosen service provider. - Navigate to their API documentation and obtain the necessary API keys for authentication. **Step 3: Install Adobe Bridge SDK for 2023** - Download the Adobe Bridge SDK for the correct version from the Adobe I/O Console. - Follow the installation instructions to set it up on your Windows machine. **Step 4: Set Up Your Scripting Environment** - Ensure you have a code editor (like Visual Studio Code) and a JavaScript runtime environment (like Node.js) installed on your machine. - Set up a new project folder where you’ll store your script files. **Step 5: Write the AI-Driven Tagging Script** - In your code editor, start a new JavaScript file named \`aiTaggingAssistant.jsx\` for the script. - Within the script, use Adobe Bridge's scripting API to access selected files. - Write the code to send image data to the AI service's API endpoint. - Parse the response from the API to extract tags. - Update the metadata of the image files in Bridge with the received tags. Here's a high-level pseudocode example of what your script might look like: \`\`\`javascript // A skeleton of what your Adobe Bridge script might look like // Include the necessary libraries for HTTP requests, file handling, etc. function aiDrivenTaggingAssistant(selectedFiles) { selectedFiles.forEach(file => { const tags = getTagsFromAI(file); if (tags) { applyTagsToFile(file, tags); } }); } function getTagsFromAI(file) { // Send the file to the AI service's API endpoint. // Handle the API's response and extract tags. // Returns an array of tags. } function applyTagsToFile(file, tags) { // Use Bridge's API to update the file's keywords with the returned tags. } // Main functionality const selectedFiles = getSelectedFilesInBridge(); // You'll need to write this Bridge-specific function. aiDrivenTaggingAssistant(selectedFiles); \`\`\` **Step 6: Test Your Script** - Within Adobe Bridge, run your script to see if it behaves as expected. - Make refinements to handle errors, improve performance, and ensure accurate tag application. **Step 7: Create a User Interface (Optional)** - If you want to make your script more user-friendly, consider creating a UI with dialog boxes. - Use Adobe Bridge's ExtendScript Toolkit to design and implement the UI elements. **Step 8: Packaging and Distribution** - After thoroughly testing your script, package it as a .jsx file. - Write a README document that explains how to install and use the script with Adobe Bridge. **Step 9: Obtain Contributor Feedback** - Share your script with selected users for beta testing. - Use their feedback to make any final adjustments or improvements. Keep in mind that due to the complexity involved in interface and project-specific requirements, the above steps are more like a blueprint than a direct implementation guide. They can vary considerably based on the AI service chosen, its API specifics, and the desired functionality of the script. Also be aware that interacting with online services for AI analysis could incur costs and may require adherence to data privacy standards, so factor these considerations into your project plan."},{"instruction":"So could you also provide local and free solution as well?","output":"Creating a local and free AI-driven tagging assistant involves using open-source machine learning libraries that can be run on your local system without the need to connect to an online API. The Python ecosystem offers robust libraries for image recognition, such as TensorFlow with a pre-trained model like InceptionV3 for image classification. Since Adobe Bridge does not natively run Python scripts, the workflow would require a combination of JavaScript for the Bridge side of operations and Python for image analysis. Here's an outline for a local AI-driven tagging assistant using Python and Adobe Bridge scripting: **Step 1: Install Python and Required Libraries** - If you do not have Python installed, get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). - Install necessary libraries with \`pip\`, such as TensorFlow and possibly others like \`numpy\` and \`pillow\`. **Step 2: Set Up a Pre-trained Image Recognition Model** - Download a pre-trained TensorFlow model that is capable of image classification, for example, InceptionV3. - Familiarize yourself with how to use the model to classify images and get tags (may require some understanding of TensorFlow and machine learning). **Step 3: Write a Python Script for Image Classification** - Create a Python script that processes images and returns a set of tags for each image. - This script should be executable from the command line and will be called from the JavaScript executed by Bridge. **Step 4: Set Up Your Adobe Bridge Scripting Environment** - Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., \`localAiTaggingAssistant.jsx\`) that Adobe Bridge will execute. - The script should interact with selected files in Bridge and call the Python script using the system's shell. **Step 5: Develop the Bridge Integration Script** - Use Adobe Bridge's JavaScript scripting API to get the paths of selected image files. - Write code to call the Python script for each image and capture the output (the tags). - Update the metadata of the image files in Bridge with the returned tags. **Step 6: Test the Entire Workflow** - Select images within Adobe Bridge and run your JavaScript. - Check if the images are processed by the Python script and that the resulting tags are correctly applied to the images' metadata within Bridge. **Step 7: Create Error Handling and Logs** - Implement error handling within both the Bridge script and Python script to handle cases such as failed image processing or issues updating metadata. - Create logs for actions and errors for easy troubleshooting. **Step 8: Documentation and Usage Instructions** - Write clear documentation on how to set up and use the scripts, including how to install Python and the required libraries. **Step 9: Distribution and Feedback** - Share your tool with colleagues or the community and gather feedback to improve functionality and usability. Example Command in \`.jsx\` script to call a Python script might look like: \`\`\`javascript var pythonScriptPath = \\"C:pathtoyourpythonscript.py\\"; var imagePath = \\"C:pathtothecurrentimage.jpg\\"; var command = \\"python \\"\\" + pythonScriptPath + \\"\\" \\"\\" + imagePath + \\"\\"\\"; var tags = app.system(command); // Execute the command and capture the output \`\`\` Your Python script will need to be configured to handle command-line arguments (using \`sys.argv\`), process the image, perform the classification, and print the result back to stdout, which is captured by the \`.jsx\` script. This approach requires users to have Python installed and the appropriate scripts configured correctly, which makes it a bit more complex than an all-JavaScript solution within Adobe Bridge. However, it has the benefit of being entirely local and free, assuming you use open-source libraries and models."},{"instruction":"Do you have an ability to learn specific subjects in depth such as Photoshop scripting for example?","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm designed to have a broad knowledge base and help with a wide range of topics.

Her heart held an insatiable wanderlust, and she dreamt of the day she would embark on a grand journey to see the world beyond her small corner of it. As seasons turned and years slipped by, Lyra prepared, saving each coin, studying maps, and learning from the tales of travelers passing through. The morning that marked the beginning of her adventure finally arrived—a bright, brisk spring day. With a leather satchel slung over her shoulder and a sturdy walking stick in hand, Lyra took one last look at the cobblestone path of her childhood and set out toward the unknown. Lyra traversed through emerald forests, over serene brooks, and into bustling towns with strange customs and curious scents. She climbed steep mountains where the air was thin and pure and crossed arid lands where the sun was relentless but the night sky, a canvas of a thousand diamonds. With each step, her confidence grew, and with each encounter, her journal filled with tales of kindness, courage, and wonder. Her journey took her east, toward the great Crescent Bay famed for its breathtaking sunrises and the indigo depths of its waters. People spoke of a small, secluded island at the heart of the bay, where no footsteps marred its sands, and it was untouched by time. Captivated, Lyra's determined eyes set upon this mysterious isle as the zenith of her expedition. Nearing the coastline, she secured passage on a humble fishing boat whose captain, grizzled by years at sea, agreed to take her across the treacherous waters. The promise of the solitary island beaconed, and her heart surged with joy as the salty breeze whispered of new horizons. Days into the voyage, the skies betrayed their serene appearance as the sun's face was shrouded by a cloak of swirling black clouds. The waves, now colossal, clashed against the boat with a fury that shook the bones of man and vessel alike. Lyra clung desperately to the railing, her eyes wide with alarm as the captain and his crew fought to navigate the storm. The very elements seemed to rage against them, a primordial force awakened and angry. Without warning, a towering wall of water rose like a titan from the depths, a rogue wave born of the tempest's heart. It struck the boat with a devastating blow, splintering wood and tearing sails, casting both men and precious supplies into the dark belly of the sea. Lyra felt the world spin and lurch before water filled her vision, cold and unyielding. When she awoke, it was on a beach, the storm receded, leaving an eerie calm hanging in the air. The island, by some stroke of fortune or fate, had caught her in its embrace, though the price of sanctuary was steep. Alone, with nothing but the salt-stained clothes on her back and the stars to keep her company, she looked upon the beach—her destination now a prison. Days turned into weeks as Lyra struggled for survival, foraging for food, constructing a rudimentary shelter, and signaling for rescue. Fires burned into the night, smoky beacons reaching out to the world she had been severed from. In time, her prayers were answered, an explorer's ship drawn by the unusual sign of life on the island and the peculiar smoke whispering above its trees. The crew found her a changed woman, her eyes reflecting both the ordeal she endured and the awe for the strength she never knew she had. Lyra's journey, intended to be an enterprise of discovery, had turned into a profound testament to her resilience. Though the disaster had interrupted her dream, it ultimately bore witness to the spirit's capacity to prevail, to adapt and to grow in the face of adversity. Battling against the forces of nature, she found a deeper journey—a voyage within, a discovery not of places, but of her own untapped tenacity and courage. And as the ship carried her home, beyond the whispering horizon, Lyra knew her true journey was far from over. This was but a chapter in an unending tale of adventure, for the heart that has known the fury of the storm learns to sail the winds of fate with newfound bravery."},{"instruction":"(A∈B, C, D)(B∈A, C, D)(C∈B, A, D)(D∈B, C, A)(A∈A1)(B∈B1)(C∈C1)(D∈D1):(A=C)(B=Si)(C=Ge)(D=Sn)(A1=FeOSFCl)(B1=BiSNOBr)(C1=AuClFIN)(D1=UNPFS)","output":"We are given the following statements: 1) A ∈ B, C, D 2) B ∈ A, C, D 3) C ∈ B, A, D 4) D ∈ B, C, A 5) A ∈ A1 6) B ∈ B1 7) C ∈ C1 8) D ∈ D1 From statement 1, we know that A is an element of B, C, and D.
