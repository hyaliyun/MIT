Then for n=k+1, we have S_{k+1}S_k - 2S_{k+1} + 1 + 1 = 0, which leads to S_{k+1} = frac{1}{2 - frac{k}{k+1}} = frac{k+1}{k+1+1}. Thus, the conjecture holds for n=k+1. Combining (①) and (②), we conclude that the conjecture is true. Therefore, for n geq 2, a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = frac{1}{n(n+1)}. This also holds for n=1.

Setting ( y = 0 ) in the original equation:    [    x + f(0) = a(0 + f(x)) implies x = af(x)    ]    Solving for ( f(x) ), we get:    [    f(x) = frac{x}{a}    ]    Substituting ( f(x) = frac{x}{a} ) back into the original equation:    [    x + frac{y}{a} = a left( y + frac{x}{a} right)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    x + frac{y}{a} = ay + x    ]    Rearranging terms, we get:    [    frac{y}{a} - ay = 0 implies y left( frac{1}{a} - a right) = 0    ]    Since this must hold for all ( y ), we have:    [    frac{1}{a} - a = 0 implies a^2 = 1 implies a = pm 1    ]    Since we are considering ( a neq 1 ), we have ( a = -1 ).

The objective is to find the point of tangency where the tangent line is parallel to the line x+y+1=0, and then determine the shortest distance using the formula for the distance between a point and a line. **Steps:** 1.

C: The sum of squared residuals can be used to assess the goodness of fit for a model. Smaller sums of squared residuals indicate a better fit of the model, which makes this statement correct. D: The coefficient of determination, denoted as R-square ((R^2)), is an indicator of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A larger (R^2) value typically indicates a better model fit.

Finally, substituting lambda = 2 back into our hyperbola equation:    [    a^2 = 9 times 2 = 18 quad text{and} quad b^2 = 16 times 2 = 32    ]    Hence, the hyperbola equation is:    [    frac{x^2}{18} - frac{y^2}{32} = 1    ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{x^2}{18} - frac{y^2}{32} = 1} ]"},{"instruction":") sin alpha+sin beta+sin gamma leq 3 sqrt{3} / 2 b) cos (alpha / 2)+cos (beta / 2)+cos (gamma / 2) leq 3 sqrt{3} / 2","output":"a) We start with the inequality (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma leq frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}). 1. By using the known identity for the sum of sines of angles in a triangle:    [    sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma = frac{p}{R}    ]    where (p) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and (R) is the circumradius. 2. According to Problem 10.29, we have the following inequality:    [    p leq frac{3 sqrt{3} R}{2}    ] 3. Substituting this result into the sum of sines identity, we get:    [    sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma = frac{p}{R} leq frac{frac{3 sqrt{3} R}{2}}{R} = frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}    ]    Thus, we have proved that:    [    sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma leq frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}    ]    (boxed{frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}}) --- b) Now we address the inequality (cos left(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cos left(frac{beta}{2}right) + cos left(frac{gamma}{2}right) leq frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}). 1. It follows from part (a) and the provided remark that similar methods apply. 2. The sum of (cos left(frac{theta}{2}right)) for the internal angles of the triangle can be bounded similarly by observing the properties of cosine functions for angles up to (pi). 3. Thus, using analogous reasoning and known inequalities for the half-angles, we reach the same upper bound:    [    cos left(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cos left(frac{beta}{2}right) + cos left(frac{gamma}{2}right) leq frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}    ]    (boxed{frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}}) --- c) We consider the inequality (operatorname{ctg} alpha + operatorname{ctg} beta + operatorname{ctg} gamma geq sqrt{3}). 1.

According to Problem 10.53(b), it is given that:    [    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 geq 4sqrt{3} S    ] 3.

A 13 times 13 chessboard contains a total of: [ 13 times 13 = 169 text{ squares} ] **Step 2:** Identify the goal. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to place nonoverlapping 1 times 4 rectangular tiles such that every square is covered except the central one. **Step 3:** Calculate the total number of squares that needs to be covered (all but the central one). Since 1 square is to be left uncovered, we need to cover: [ 169 - 1 = 168 text{ squares} ] **Step 4:** Understand the properties of the tiles. Each 1 times 4 rectangular tile covers exactly 4 squares. **Step 5:** Calculate the number of 1 times 4 tiles needed to cover 168 squares: [ frac{168}{4} = 42 text{ tiles} ] Thus, 42 tiles are needed to cover 168 squares if every tile is used efficiently and nonoverlappingly. **Step 6:** Now, consider how these tiles would be placed on the board and their interaction with the central square. Label the squares on the board with coordinates ((i, j)) where (i) and (j) range from 1 to 13. **Step 7:** The central square is: [ left( frac{13+1}{2}, frac{13+1}{2} right) = (7,7) ] **Step 8:** Use a checkerboard-like coloring (common technique for such problems). Color the squares such that adjacent squares have different colors. For example, color alternate squares black and white. **Step 9:** Each 1 times 4 tile will cover a combination of 2 white and 2 black squares because the chessboard is colored alternatively. **Step 10:** Calculate the distribution of colored squares on the board: [ 13 times 13 = 169 text{ squares} ] Half of these are white and half are black (with one more white square due to the odd dimension): [ 85 text{ white squares and } 84 text{ black squares} ] **Step 11:** Verify placement constraints.

He walks for a while, and then his wife picks him up and they arrive home 30 minutes earlier than usual, so they arrive at time H - 30 minutes. The time the man spent walking is the difference between the usual meeting time and the early arrival time, T - E. During this time, the wife is still driving towards the station. When she picks him up, they spend less time driving home than usual because the man has already covered some of the distance by walking. Let's denote the driving speed as S and the walking speed as W. The distance the man covers while walking is W * (T - E). The distance the wife drives from the point she picks him up to home is S * (H - T - 30 minutes). Since the man has walked part of the way, the total time spent driving is reduced by the time he spent walking. Therefore, the driving time on this day is (H - T) - (T - E) = H - E - 30 minutes.

To solve this problem, we will consider the problem of filling a right angle divided into infinitely many unit squares with natural numbers such that each row and each column contains all natural numbers exactly once. 2. Let's begin with the filling strategy:    - Fill the first row with natural numbers in order: 1, 2, 3, ldots.    - In each subsequent row, place the smallest possible number that hasn't yet been placed and adheres to the column constraint: it must not repeat in the column. 3. The strategy can be described step-by-step as follows:    - ( R_1: 1, 2, 3, 4, ldots ) (first row)    - ( R_2 ) onwards, for each cell ((i, j)) in row (i):      - Pick the smallest number that is not in the first (j-1) columns and the first (i-1) rows. 4. We need to show that by this method, every natural number ( n ) will appear in the ( k )-th column.  5. For a number ( n ) to appear in the ( k )-th column (C_k):    - Suppose ( n ) does not appear in ( C_k ).    - This implies ( n ) must have appeared in the first ( k-1 ) columns in some row.    - In the worst case, ( n ) appears in one row of each of the first ( k-1 ) columns, i.e., ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{k-1} ).    - However, since there are infinite rows and we have a new row each time, this would contradict the inability to place ( n ) eventually in ( C_k ) because the opportunity is endless. 6. By following this placement strategy, each row and each column ends up containing all natural numbers exactly once. 7. Consequently, we have successfully filled the grid such that both each row and each column contain all natural numbers exactly once. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{It is possible}} ] # Additional proof for the existence of such filling within limits: To address the secondary specific problem related to a number ( M ): 1.

To determine the relationship between the two circles, we calculate the distance between their centers, |C_{1}C_{2}|, and compare it with their radii, r_{1} and r_{2}. 1. **Distance between centers**: [|C_{1}C_{2}| = sqrt{(2-0)^{2} + (b-0)^{2}} = sqrt{4+b^{2}}] 2. **Radius differences and sums**: [r_{1} - r_{2} = 4 - 2 = 2] [r_{1} + r_{2} = 4 + 2 = 6] **Option A**: For b=1, we find |C_{1}C_{2}| = sqrt{4+1} = sqrt{5}. Since sqrt{5} in (2,6), it means the two circles intersect. Thus, option A is correct. **Option B**: Since |C_{1}C_{2}| = sqrt{4+b^{2}} geq 2 = r_{1} - r_{2} for any b in mathbb{R}, there exists a value of b for which the two circles are externally tangent. This is because the minimum distance for tangency is when |C_{1}C_{2}| = r_{1} - r_{2}. Thus, option B is correct. **Option C**: The two circles cannot be contained within each other because the minimum distance between their centers is 2 (when b=0), which is not enough for one circle to completely contain the other given their radii. Thus, option C is incorrect. **Option D**: For circle C_{2} to bisect the circumference of circle C_{1}, the line containing their common chord would need to pass through the center of C_{1}, (2,b). The equation for this line is 4x+2by-b^{2}+8=0. Substituting (2,b) into this equation gives 8+2b^{2}-b^{2}+8=0, which simplifies to 16+b^{2}=0. This equation has no real solution for b, indicating that such a bisecting line does not exist. Thus, option D is incorrect.

For the first 40 hours, the bus driver is paid at the regular rate, so the total pay for these hours is 40R. For the overtime hours (hours worked beyond 40), the bus driver is paid at a rate that is 75% higher than the regular rate. This means the overtime rate is R + 0.75R = 1.75R. The bus driver worked 60 hours, so the overtime hours are 60 - 40 = 20 hours. The total pay for the overtime hours is 20 hours * 1.75R.

Let M be the intersection of AQ and DP, and N be the intersection of PC and QB. 3. We need to find the length of MN in terms of AB and CD. First, we note that triangle AMP sim triangle QMD and triangle BNP sim triangle QNC by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. This is because: - angle AMP = angle QMD (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD) - angle MAP = angle QDM (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD) Similarly, for triangle BNP sim triangle QNC: - angle BNP = angle QNC (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD) - angle BPN = angle QCN (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD) 4. From the similarity of triangles, we have: [ frac{PM}{MD} = frac{AP}{DQ} = frac{PB}{QC} = frac{PN}{NC} ] 5. This implies that overleftrightarrow{MN} parallel overleftrightarrow{CD} because the ratios of the corresponding segments are equal. 6. To find the length of MN, we use the fact that MN is a segment parallel to CD and divides the trapezoid ABCD proportionally. Therefore: [ MN = frac{PM}{PD} cdot CD ] 7. Since frac{PM}{MD} = frac{AP}{DQ}, we can write: [ frac{PM}{PD} = frac{AP}{AP + DQ} ] 8. Given frac{AP}{PB} = frac{DQ}{CQ}, let AP = k cdot PB and DQ = k cdot CQ for some constant k. Then: [ AP = k cdot PB quad text{and} quad DQ = k cdot CQ ] 9. Since AB = AP + PB and CD = DQ + CQ, we have: [ AP = frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB quad text{and} quad DQ = frac{k}{1+k} cdot CD ] 10. Substituting these into the expression for MN: [ MN = frac{AP}{AP + DQ} cdot CD = frac{frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB}{frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB + frac{k}{1+k} cdot CD} cdot CD ] 11.

Let (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) be the roots. 2. **Rational Roots Condition**: If (x) is rational, then (sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}) must also be rational. To be more specific, (sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}) must be an integer because the rational root theorem asserts that if a number (like (sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})) is rational, its value can be expressed as a simplified fraction which is an integer. 3. **Squared Approach**: Let (sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} = d) where (d) is an integer, then we have:    [    b^2 - 4ac = d^2    ] 4. **Nature of (d)**: Since (b) is odd, (b^2) is also odd (since the square of an odd number is always odd). (4ac) is clearly even (since it contains the factor 4).     Therefore, (b^2 - 4ac) is an odd number (difference of an odd and an even number is odd), which implies that (d^2) is also an odd number. Consequently, (d) must be odd (since the square of an odd number is odd). 5. **Express (d)**: Let (d = b - 2d') for some integer (d') (since (d) is an adjustment of (b) by an even number). 6. **Next Step**: Substitute back into the equation:    [    b^2 - 4ac = (b - 2d')^2    ] 7. **Simplification**:    [    b^2 - 4ac = b^2 - 4bd' + 4d'^2    ]    [    -4ac = -4bd' + 4d'^2    ]    [    ac = bd' - d'^2    ] 8. **Contradiction**: On the left side, (ac) is a product of two odd numbers, hence (ac) is odd. On the right side, (bd' - d'^2) will either be odd or even, depending on whether (d') itself is odd or even:    - If (d') is even, (bd') is even while (d'^2) is even, making their difference even.    - If (d') is odd, (bd') (product of two odd numbers) is odd, (d'^2) is also odd, making their difference even.     In both cases, the right side is even, while the left side is odd, which is a contradiction.    Thus, it is impossible for (b^2 - 4ac) to be a perfect square, so it cannot be an integer. This invalidates our assumption that the roots are rational. [ boxed{text{Therefore, the roots of } ax^2 + bx + c = 0 text{ are not rational.}} ] # Second Proof: Let's assume a rational root exists, and let's represent it in its simplest form as (frac{p}{q}) where ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ). 1. **Form of Rational Root**:    [    a left(frac{p^2}{q^2}right) + b left(frac{p}{q}right) + c = 0    ] 2. **Clearing Denominator**: Multiply the entire equation by (q^2) to get rid of the denominator:    [    a p^2 + b p q + c q^2 = 0    ] 3. **Analyzing Parity**: Since (a, b, c) are all odd, let's analyze the parity of (ap^2 + bpq + cq^2):    - If both (p) and (q) are odd, then (p^2) and (q^2) are both odd (since the square of an odd number is odd). The term (ap^2) is odd (since (a) is odd), (bpq) is odd (product of 3 odd numbers), and (cq^2) is odd.     - The sum of odd numbers is odd, making (ap^2 + bpq + cq^2) odd.    This contradicts the left side being 0 which is even.    - If one of (p) or (q) is even and the other is odd:      - Without loss of generality, assume (p) is odd and (q) is even.      - Then, (ap^2) is odd (since (a) and (p^2) are odd), (bpq) is even (product of odd and even numbers is even), and (cq^2) is even (since even number squared is even).    In this case, the sum contains an odd term ((ap^2)) and two even terms ((bpq) and (cq^2)), resulting in an overall term that is odd. This again contradicts the left side being 0 (even).    Therefore, (p) and (q) cannot both be odds, one even and the other odd. Both (p) and (q) being even is also not possible since the fraction (frac{p}{q}) would not be in simplest form. So, it is impossible for the polynomial (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) to have rational roots.

The magnitude of a complex number z = a + bi is given by |z| = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. Therefore, to find |z|, we calculate the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator separately and then divide them: |z| = frac{|3+4i|}{|1-2i|}.

Given our analysis, let's summarize: - Condition (1) is possible because lines l, m, and n can intersect each other at angles of 60^circ forming an equilateral triangle. - Condition (2) is not possible because parallel lines do not intersect at all. - Condition (3) is possible, given that another circle C' exists that can intersect l, m, and n.

Therefore, ( R ) must be constant, say ( d > 0 ). 7. **Form of ( P(x) )**:    - If ( d > 1 ) or ( l > 1 ), then we can choose ( x = 2 ) and ( m = d2^l > 2 ) to get ( m mid Q(2) ) but ( m nmid 2 ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( Q(x) = x ) and ( P(x) = x + c ). 8. **Narrowing Down ( c )**:    - Clearly, ( c geq 0 ) works, so assume ( c < 0 ); let ( -c = d > 0 ). Then ( |P(x)| = d - x ) for ( 1 leq x leq d ), and ( |P(x)| = x - d ) otherwise. This implies ( |P(a)| - |P(b)| = pm (a - b) ) or ( pm (a + b - 2d) ).    - If ( 0 < a < b leq n ) and ( n mid |P(a)| - |P(b)| ), then we must have ( |P(a)| - |P(b)| = pm (a + b - 2d) ), so ( a, b ) lie on different sides of ( d ): ( b > d geq a ). So if ( n leq d ), ( P_n = 0 ). Else we have:      [      -n < -d < a + b - 2d leq n - d < n      ]    - So if ( n mid pm (a + b - 2d) ), we must have ( a + b = 2d ). For ( n < 2d ), this has precisely ( n - d leq d - 1 ) solutions, and for ( n geq 2d ), it has precisely ( d - 1 ) solutions. Therefore, we must have ( d - 1 leq 2021 implies d leq 2022 ).

The sequence of powers of ( c ) for increasing exponents forms a geometric progression with ratio ( c > 1 ). 2. Given that ( c ) is slightly greater than 1 (specifically, growth is less than 3%), we note that the growth rate of the sequence is relatively slow. 3. The logarithm of ( c ) from logarithm tables is found to be ( lg c = 0.0100 ). Therefore, for the 100th power:    [    lg c^{100} = 100 cdot lg c = 1.00    ]    This implies ( c^{100} approx 10 ). 4. We use logarithms to determine the starting digit of the values ( c^k ). For a number ( c^k ) to start with 1, its value must lie between 1 and 2:    [    1 < c^k < 2    ]    Taking logarithms of the intervals and using ( lg c = 0.0100 ):    [    0 < k cdot lg c < lg 2    ]    [    0 < 0.0100 cdot k < 0.3010    ]    Solving for ( k ):    [    k < frac{0.3010}{0.0100} = 30.1    ]    Hence, for ( k ) from 1 to 30, ( c^k ) starts with 1. 5.

The objective is to ensure that the marked cells do not allow Vasya to place a 3-cell L-shaped piece (corner cell) in a manner that covers unmarked cells and creates ambiguity. **Step 1: Understanding facts related to marked and unmarked cells** 1. In any 2 times 3 rectangle, there can be at most one unmarked cell. This can be verified by direct checking of all configurations.     2. In any 3 times 3 square, there can be at most two unmarked cells. If there are two unmarked cells, they must be located at diagonal corners of the square. Otherwise, there will be a 2 times 3 rectangle within the 3 times 3 square containing two unmarked cells, which violates the first fact. 3. In any 3 times 6 rectangle (either vertical or horizontal), there can be at most three unmarked cells. To see why, divide the rectangle into two 3 times 3 squares. The common side of those squares is a row or column of 3 cells. According to fact 1, this common line segment can include at most one unmarked cell. Given that each 3 times 3 square can have at most two unmarked cells according to fact 2, the total combined number of unmarked cells in the 3 times 6 rectangle cannot exceed three. **Step 2: Analyzing board breakdown** If we divide the 9 times 9 board into 9 smaller 3 times 3 squares, there can be at most two unmarked cells per square based on the above-mentioned facts. Therefore, a maximum of 5 out of these 9 smaller squares would contain any unmarked cells because: - If there are 4 such squares with 2 unmarked cells each: 4 cdot 2 = 8 unmarked cells. - The other 5 squares can have at most 1 unmarked cell each, giving an additional 5 unmarked cells. - Thus, the maximum number of unmarked cells possible would be (4 cdot 2 + 5 = 13). **Step 3: Arranging configurations** If we need to cover the case where k could be minimized such that Vasya cannot point to the L-shaped corner, we should consider different board configurations: - Configuring 5 squares having exactly 2 unmarked cells each and calculating, it totals up to (5 cdot 2 = 10) unmarked cells. - Any configuration must meet the conditions such as each 2 times 3 section of the divided 3 times 6 rectangles must follow the above-stated facts. **Step 4: Final Configuration and Conclusion** Finally, let's consider simpler confirmation, where k = total cells = 81 - 13 covered cells = 68: - Petya marks 68 cells leaving exactly 13 unmarked cells. - The arrangement should be made strategically such that no 3-cell L-shape corner in cells could cover two unmarked cells and provide ambiguity to Vasya's win. Thus, the smallest number k where Petya can mark the cells such that Vasya cannot win is (boxed{68})."},{"instruction":"A courtyard is 42 meters long and 22 meters wide and is to be paved with bricks of dimensions 16 cm by 10 cm.

We begin by examining the parametric equations for point ( P(x, y) ) where ( P ) moves on the unit circle with angular velocity (omega). This means we can represent the coordinates of ( P ) as:    [    x = cos(omega t), quad y = sin(omega t)    ] 2. The coordinates of point ( Q(-2xy, y^2 - x^2) ) are given in terms of ( x ) and ( y ). We substitute ( x ) and ( y ) with (cos(omega t)) and (sin(omega t)), respectively:    [    Q left( -2 x y, y^2 - x^2 right) = Q left( -2 cos(omega t) sin(omega t), sin^2(omega t) - cos^2(omega t) right)    ] 3.

The coordinates of point ( Q ) can now be written as:    [    Q left( -sin(2 omega t), -cos(2 omega t) right)    ] 5. Recognize that these coordinates correspond to a point on a unit circle, but with an angle ( 2 omega t ). Notice the transformations that identify ( Q )'s movement. The ( -sin(2 omega t) ) and ( -cos(2 omega t) ) components indicate that ( Q ) is moving in the opposite direction compared to the usual counter-clockwise direction for increasing ( 2 omega t ). 6. To clarify, rewrite the coordinates in a common sine and cosine form:    [    Q left( -sin(2 omega t), -cos(2 omega t) right) = Q left( cosleft(frac{3}{2}pi - 2 omega tright), sinleft(frac{3}{2}pi - 2 omega tright) right)    ] 7.

The condition implies that the projection of overrightarrow{OC} onto overrightarrow{OA} is twice the projection of overrightarrow{OC} onto overrightarrow{OB}. This suggests that the slope of line OC is frac{1}{2}. 2. **Setting Coordinates**: Let's denote overrightarrow{a} = overrightarrow{OA}, overrightarrow{b} = overrightarrow{OB}, and overrightarrow{c} = overrightarrow{OC}. We can represent these vectors as points in the plane: A(a, 0), B(0, b), and C(c, frac{c}{2}).  3. **Analyzing f(m, n)**: The function f(m, n) = frac{|moverrightarrow{c} - overrightarrow{b}|}{|moverrightarrow{c} - noverrightarrow{a}|} can be geometrically interpreted as frac{|overrightarrow{BD}|}{|overrightarrow{ED}|}, where D and E are points determined by the vectors moverrightarrow{c} - overrightarrow{b} and moverrightarrow{c} - noverrightarrow{a}, respectively. 4. **Maximizing with Respect to n**: Keeping m constant and varying n means keeping point D fixed while moving point E. The maximum value of f(m, n) occurs when E_{0}D perp OA, leading to f(m, n) leq frac{|overrightarrow{BD}|}{|overrightarrow{E_{0}D}|}. 5. **Minimizing with Respect to m**: Now, we vary m to change the position of D. The goal is to find the minimum value of frac{|overrightarrow{BD}|}{|overrightarrow{E_{0}D}|}. Using the coordinates of B and C, we find that frac{|overrightarrow{BD}|}{|{E}_{0}D|} = sqrt{frac{{(c-0)}^2 + {(frac{c}{2}-b)}^2}{{(frac{c}{2})}^2}} = sqrt{4 + {(1-frac{2b}{c})}^2} geq 2, with equality when c = 2b. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the minimum value of f(m, n) after maximizing with respect to n and then minimizing with respect to m is 2.

We have 0.50 moles of AgNO₃ and 0.35 moles of NaOH. To find the limiting reagent, we compare the mole ratio of the reactants to the mole ratio in the balanced equation. Since the ratio is 1:1, the reactant with fewer moles will be the limiting reagent. In this case, NaOH is the limiting reagent because we have only 0.35 moles of it compared to 0.50 moles of AgNO₃. Since NaOH is the limiting reagent, it will determine the amount of AgOH produced. Therefore, 0.35 moles of NaOH will react with 0.35 moles of AgNO₃ to produce 0.35 moles of AgOH.

We start by considering the equations given in the problem: [ frac{x+y}{z} = frac{y+z}{x} = frac{z+x}{y}. ] 2. Note that if ( x = y = z ), then substituting ( x = y = z ) into the equation we get: [ frac{2x}{x} = frac{2x}{x} = frac{2x}{x} = 2. ] This simplifies to 2, which is consistent. We now calculate the value of  [ frac{(x+y)(y+z)(z+x)}{xyz} ] when ( x = y = z ): [ frac{(x+x)(x+x)(x+x)}{xxx} = frac{8x^3}{x^3} = 8. ] Thus, when ( x = y = z ), the value of the given expression is ( 8 ). 3. Now, let’s consider the case where not all variables are equal. Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume ( x neq y ). From the initial conditions, we use the fact that [ frac{y+z}{x} = frac{z+x}{y}. ] 4. Multiplying both sides by the denominators ( x ) and ( y ), we get: [ y^2 + yz = x^2 + xz. ] 5. Rearrange the equation to isolate like terms: [ y^2 - x^2 = xz - yz. ] 6. Factor both sides of the equation: [ (x+y)(x-y) = z(y-x). ] 7. Since ( x neq y ), we can divide both sides by ( x - y ): [ x + y = -z. ] This simplifies to: [ x + y + z = 0. ] 8. Substitute ( z = -(x+y) ) into the expression we need to evaluate: [ frac{(x+y)(y+z)(z+x)}{xyz} ] where ( z = -(x+y) ): Substitute and simplify: [ y+z = y - (x+y) = -x, quad z+x = -(x+y)+x = -y. ] Thus, the expression becomes: [ frac{(x+y)(-x)(-y)}{xyz} = frac{-(x+y)xy}{xyz} = -frac{x+y}{z}. ] Since ( x + y + z = 0 ), we get: [ -z = frac{-z}{z} = -1. ] So when ( x, y, z ) are not all equal, the value is ( -1 ). 9.

Since the coins are made from the same material and have the same thickness, their weights are proportional to the area of their surfaces. 3. The surface area of a circle (coin) of radius R is given by A = pi R^2. Therefore, the equilibrium condition can be written as:    [    pi R_1^2 + pi R_2^2 = pi R_3^2    ] 4.

Prove that all its vertices have even degree.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We have a map properly colored with two colors, and we need to prove that all its vertices have an even degree. 2. **Graph Theory Interpretation:**    The map can be represented as a graph where:    - Each country is a vertex.    - An edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding countries share a border. 3. **Bipartite Graph:**    Since the map is properly colored with two colors, the graph is bipartite, meaning it can be divided into two disjoint sets of vertices such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. 4. **Degree of Vertices in a Bipartite Graph:**    In a bipartite graph, without loss of generality, suppose the sets are U and V. Each edge connects a vertex in U with a vertex in V. Therefore, every vertex must connect with vertices of the opposite color.     5. **Proof by Contradiction:**    - Assume that there is at least one vertex with an odd degree.    - All adjacent vertices to this vertex should also be considered and should have opposite colors.    - If a vertex had an odd degree, say (v), then it would imply that there is an odd number of edges connecting (v) to vertices of the opposite set. 6. **Counting Edges:**    - Consider the sum of the degrees of all vertices. In any graph, this sum is equal to twice the number of edges (since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices).    - If there exists a vertex with an odd degree, it contradicts the property that the sum of degrees of vertices, being twice the number of edges, must be even because an odd number added to an even number gives an odd result. 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the assumption that a vertex with an odd degree exists contradicts the even sum of degrees of the vertices.

This length can be found using the formula:      [      2R = frac{AM}{|cos alpha|}      ]      Note: This formula holds as long as alpha neq 90^{circ}. If alpha turns out to be exactly 90^{circ}, the triangle is right-angled, which requires special consideration. 3. **Constructing Points B and C:**    - Construct a circle k with diameter 2R and let this circle be centered at a point K.    - Place points B and C on the circle such that angle BKC = 2alpha.    - Depending on whether alpha < 90^{circ} or alpha > 90^{circ}, point A will lie on different arcs relative to BC. 4. **Positioning the Incenter O:**    - The possible positions for O as the incenter are found by intersecting two loci:      - One locus is a line g parallel to BC at a distance varrho on the side containing O.      - The other locus is a circle centered at D (the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A) with radius DB (which equals DC). This follows from the equal division of the arc into angles beta and gamma. 5. **Final Triangle Construction:**    - After determining the possible intersections for O, we select the appropriate one (note: intersections occur symmetrically about D).    - Draw line DO to determine the point A by intersecting it with the circle k. 6. **Verification and Adjustments:**    - Validate that A, B, and C form the required triangle by checking if A, B, and C indeed satisfy the length conditions AM, AO, and the respective varrho for the incircle.    - If necessary, verify the geometric properties using known theorems such as the Inscribed Angle Theorem and properties of orthocenters and incenters. **Conclusion:** Given the correct steps, angles, and distances, the triangle ABC satisfies all the constructed geometric conditions.

We are given P(-2 leq xi leq 0) = 0.4. Symmetry implies that P(0 < xi leq 2) is also 0.4. Now, to find P(xi > 2), we also need to consider P(xi < -2).

Therefore, the number of surviving first generation pups is 56 * 0.8 = 44.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a mouse, we'll round down to 44 pups. 4. Now, we have the original 8 mice plus the 44 surviving first generation pups, totaling 8 + 44 = 52 mice. 5. All 52 mice have another 7 pups each, resulting in 52 * 7 = 364 second generation pups. 6.

Since there are 50 adult mice, the total number of pups eaten is 50 * 3 = 150 pups. 9. We subtract the number of pups eaten from the number of surviving second generation pups to find out how many are left: 218 - 150 = 68 pups.

Proposed by Adrian Beker.","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Key Observation:**    We are given that ( P^n(m) cdot P^m(n) ) is a square of an integer for all nonnegative integers ( n ) and ( m ). This implies that for any prime ( p ), ( p cdot P^p(0) ) must be a square, forcing ( p mid P^p(0) ) for all primes ( p ). 2. **Considering Primes Not Dividing ( P(0) ):**    Take a prime ( p ) such that ( p nmid P(0) ). We claim that the set ( { P(0), P^2(0), dots, P^p(0) } ) forms a complete residue system modulo ( p ). 3. **Proof of Claim 1:**    Consider the sequence:    [    0 mapsto P(0) mapsto P(P(0)) mapsto dots mapsto P^p(0)    ]    Let ( a ) be the smallest positive integer such that ( P^a(0) equiv 0 pmod{p} ). By definition, ( a mid p ), so ( a = 1 ) or ( a = p ). Since ( p nmid P(0) ), ( a neq 1 ), thus ( a = p ). If there exist ( 1 le a < b le p-1 ) such that ( P^a(0) equiv P^b(0) pmod{p} ), then ( P^p(0) equiv P^{p - b + a}(0) pmod{p} ), forcing ( k = p - b + a < p ) to satisfy ( P^k(0) equiv 0 pmod{p} ), a contradiction. Thus, all must be distinct residues, forming a complete residue system modulo ( p ). 4. **Extension to General ( k ):**    We extend this to show that ( { P^k(0), dots, P^{k + p - 1}(0) } ) is a complete residue system modulo ( p ). Since ( P^p(0) equiv 0 pmod{p} ), and ( P in mathbb{Z}[x] ), we have ( P^{a + p}(0) = P^a(P^p(0)) equiv P^a(0) pmod{p} ). Thus, ( { k, k + 1, dots, k + p - 1 } equiv { 1, 2, dots, p } ) in ( mathbb{Z}_p ). 5. **Considering General ( t ):**    For any integer ( t in mathbb{Z} ), we claim that ( { t, P(t), dots, P^{p - 1}(t) } ) forms a complete residue system modulo ( p ). Since ( { P(0), P^2(0), dots, P^p(0) } ) forms a complete residue system modulo ( p ), we can find ( 1 le k le p - 1 ) such that ( P^k(0) equiv t pmod{p} ). Thus,    [    { t, P(t), dots, P^{p - 1}(t) } equiv { P^k(0), P^{k + 1}(0), dots, P^{k + p - 1}(0) } pmod{p}    ] 6. **Main Claim: ( P(n) - n ) is a Constant:**    For any prime ( p nmid P(0) ) and any integer ( t in mathbb{Z} ), ( p nmid P(t) - t ) (since ( { t, P(t) } ) are distinct residues modulo ( p ) for any ( t in mathbb{Z} )). Therefore, if ( mathcal{P} ) is the set of primes dividing ( P(n) - n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), and ( mathcal{Q} ) is the set of primes dividing ( P(0) ), then    [    mathcal{P} subseteq mathcal{Q} Rightarrow |mathcal{P}| le |mathcal{Q}|    ]    This implies ( |mathcal{P}| ) is finite. By **Schur's Theorem**, unless ( P(n) - n ) is a constant, ( |mathcal{P}| ) is infinite, which is a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion:**    Thus, ( P(n) = n + b ) for some integer ( b ). We need ( P^m(n) cdot P^n(m) = (n + mb)(m + nb) ) to be a square for all ( n, m in mathbb{N}_0 ). Taking ( n = 0, m = 1 ) gives ( b ) being a perfect square. Taking ( m = 4, n = 1 ), we have ( 4b^2 + 17b + 4 ) being a square. Solving,    [    (2b + 2)^2 = 4b^2 + 8b + 4 < 4b^2 + 17b + 4 < 4b^2 + 20b + 25 = (2b+5)^2    ]    We find ( 4b^2 + 17b + 4 = (2b + 3)^2 rightarrow b = 1 ) or ( 4b^2 + 17b + 4 = (2b + 4)^2 rightarrow b = 12 ), which is not a square.

Two boys and one girl in a group. Let's calculate the number of ways to form groups for each scenario: 1. One boy and two girls in a group:    - We can choose 1 boy from the 9 boys in 9C1 ways.    - We can choose 2 girls from the 12 girls in 12C2 ways.    - So, the number of groups with one boy and two girls is 9C1 * 12C2. 2. Two boys and one girl in a group:    - We can choose 2 boys from the 9 boys in 9C2 ways.    - We can choose 1 girl from the 12 girls in 12C1 ways.    - So, the number of groups with two boys and one girl is 9C2 * 12C1. Now, let's calculate the combinations: 1. One boy and two girls in a group:    - 9C1 = 9 (since choosing 1 out of 9 is just the number of boys)    - 12C2 = 12! / (2! * (12-2)!) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = (12 * 11) / (2 * 1) = 66    - So, the number of groups with one boy and two girls is 9 * 66 = 594. 2. Two boys and one girl in a group:    - 9C2 = 9! / (2! * (9-2)!) = 9! / (2! * 7!) = (9 * 8) / (2 * 1) = 36    - 12C1 = 12 (since choosing 1 out of 12 is just the number of girls)    - So, the number of groups with two boys and one girl is 36 * 12 = 432.

So the total distance covered when passing the platform is: Distance = Length of train + Length of platform Distance = 1200 m + 400 m Distance = 1600 m We are given that it takes 160 seconds to pass the platform. Therefore, the speed of the train (Speed = Distance / Time) is: Speed = 1600 m / 160 s Speed = 10 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train, we can calculate the time it takes to cross a tree. When crossing a tree, the train only needs to cover its own length, since a tree can be considered as a point relative to the length of the train.

Therefore, ( p ) must be an odd prime.              - Since ( p mid n ), it follows that ( b^{2n} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). This implies the order of ( b ) modulo ( p ) divides ( gcd(2n, p-1) = 2 ), thereby ( b^{2} equiv 1 pmod{p} ).       - Hence, ( p mid (b^2 - 1) ) which factors as ( (b-1)(b+1) ). Given that ( b + 1 ) is a power of 2, ( b - 1 ) and ( b + 1 ) are consecutive integers, only leading ( p ) to be a divisor of both implies ( p = 2 ).       - However, this contradicts our earlier conclusion that ( p neq 2 ). Therefore, no such ( n > 1 ) exists, which means the only ( n ) valid is ( n = 1 ) when ( b+1 ) is a power of 2. 2. **Inductive Construction for the Case ( b + 1 ) is not a Power of 2:**    - Suppose ( b + 1 ) is not a power of 2 and ( b > 2 ). We aim to construct an infinite sequence of distinct primes ( p_0, p_1, ldots ) such that:              - ( p_0^2 p_1^2 cdots p_k^2 p_{k+1} mid b^{p_0 cdots p_k} + 1 ).        - **Base Case:**             - Let ( p_0 ) be any odd prime dividing ( b+1 ).          - **Inductive Step:**           - Assume we have chosen distinct primes ( p_0, p_1, ldots, p_k ). We need to find a new prime ( p_{k+1} notin {p_0, ldots, p_k} ) such that ( p_{k+1} mid b^{p_0 p_1 cdots p_k} + 1 ).              - By Zsigmondy's theorem (stating that for any given integers ( a ) and ( b ) that are not both 2 and ( k > 1 ), there exists a prime dividing ( a^k - b^k ) that does not divide ( a^m - b^m ) for any ( m < k )), there exists such a prime.     - This ensures the continued construction of the sequence ( p_0, p_1, ldots ).    - Now considering ( c = b^{p_0 cdots p_k} ), we have ( p mid c+1 ) (for some ( p )).

According to the problem, e = frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2}, and given the distance from the right focus to the right vertex is 1, we get a - c = 1, solving this gives c = 1, a = 2. Therefore, b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 3. Thus, the standard equation of ellipse C is boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1}. (Ⅱ) There exists a line l such that overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} = 0. The reason is as follows: From begin{cases} y=kx+m  frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1 end{cases}, we get (3+4k^2)x^2 + 8kmx + 4m^2 - 12 = 0. Delta = (8km)^2 - 4(3+4k^2)(4m^2 - 12) > 0, simplifying gives 3+4k^2 > m^2. Let A(x_1, y_1), B(x_2, y_2), then x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8km}{3+4k^2}, x_1x_2 = frac{4m^2-12}{3+4k^2}. If overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} = 0, then x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0, i.e., x_1x_2 + (kx_1+m)(kx_2+m) = 0, we get (1+k^2)x_1x_2 + km(x_1 + x_2) + m^2 = 0, i.e., (1+k^2) cdot frac{4m^2-12}{3+4k^2} - km cdot frac{8km}{3+4k^2} + m^2 = 0, simplifying gives, 7m^2 = 12 + 12k^2, substituting k^2 = frac{7}{12}m^2 - 1 into 3+4k^2 > m^2, we get 3+4 times (frac{7}{12}m^2 - 1) > m^2, solving this gives m^2 > frac{3}{4}.

Therefore, a = frac{8 + 9}{2} = 8.5. - **Mode of Class 8(1):**   The most frequent score in Class 8(1) is 9, as it appears four times.   Thus, b = 9. - **Excellent Rate of Class 8(1):**   There are 4 scores of 9 and 2 scores of 10, totaling 6 excellent scores out of 10.   Hence, m = frac{6}{10} times 100% = 60%. Therefore, the answers are: a = 8.5, b = 9, m = 60%.  For Part (2): Given Xiaoming's score is 9 and his statement, \\"my preliminary round score is better than half of the students,\\" implies that the median score in his class must be below 9. Since the median score of Class 8(2) is 8.5 and that of Class 8(1) is 9, Xiaoming must be in Class 8(2). Therefore, Xiaoming is a student of Class 8(2), so the answer is: boxed{(2)}.  For Part (3): If there are 500 students in the eighth grade and only those who score full marks (10 points) can enter the finals, we can estimate the number of students entering the finals based on the proportion observed in the selected students. Since 4 out of 20 students scored full marks, the estimated number of students entering the finals is: 500 times frac{4}{20} = 500 times frac{1}{5} = 100 (people). However, the standard solution states 500 times frac{6}{20} = 150 (people), which seems to consider the number of excellent scores rather than just full marks for the estimation. If we follow the logic provided in the standard solution correctly, it should be based on the number of students scoring full marks, which is 4 out of 20. This discrepancy suggests a need for clarification in the problem statement or solution. Assuming the intention was to estimate based on full marks, the corrected estimation would be: 500 times frac{4}{20} = 100 (people).

The equation of circle C can be rewritten as (x+2)^2 + (y-2a)^2 = (sqrt{3})^2. Given a = frac{3}{2}, the center C of the circle is at (-2,3), and the line l is 3x+2y+6=0.

We need to prove that the point of intersection of the medians of triangle A_{2}B_{2}C_{2} coincides with the point of intersection of the medians of triangle ABC. 3. We start by representing each side and identifying the division ratios. We denote the points A, B, and C as the material points with their respective weights:     - A with weight 1     - B with weight 2     - C with weight 4. 4.

This identity confirms the correctness because the center of mass (centroid) of the material points (A, 1), (B, 2), (C, 4) will be the centroid of ABC, denoted as O.

This equation indicates that the centroid O must be the point of intersection of the medians of triangle A_{2}B_{2}C_{2} because it balances the same weighted points (B_{2}, 7), (C_{2}, 7), (A_{2}, 7) in the same way. # Conclusion: The point of intersection of the medians of triangle A_{2}B_{2}C_{2} coincides with the point of intersection of the medians of triangle ABC.

Total points earned so far: English: 56 points Mathematics: 67 points Science: 45 points History: 81 points Physical Education: 64 points Total = 56 + 67 + 45 + 81 + 64 = 313 points Jimmy has already earned more than the 250 points needed to pass. However, we need to ensure he has at least 50% in each subject. a. English: Jimmy has 56 points out of 100. The minimum he needs to pass is 50 points (50% of 100). He can afford to lose a maximum of 6 points (56 - 50) and still pass English. b. Science: Jimmy has 45 points out of 100. He is already below the 50% threshold. Therefore, he cannot afford to lose any more points in Science. In fact, he needs to gain additional points to reach at least 50 points to pass. c. Mathematics: Jimmy has 67 points out of 100. The minimum he needs to pass is 50 points. He can afford to lose a maximum of 17 points (67 - 50) and still pass Mathematics. However, it's important to note that while Jimmy can afford to lose some points in English and Mathematics and still pass those subjects, losing points could put him at risk of falling below the total boxed{250}  points needed to pass to the next class. Jimmy should aim to not lose any further points and try to gain additional points in Science to ensure he meets both the total point requirement and the minimum percentage in each subject."},{"instruction":"Find the ones digit of 35^{35(17^{17})}.","output":"1.

There are 4 spots Xiao Zhao can visit alone, so the total number of ways for Xiao Zhao to visit a spot alone is 4 times 27 = 108. The number of ways the 4 people can visit different spots without restriction (i.e., the total number of arrangements if each person visits a different spot) is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24. Now we are interested in finding the conditional probability P(A|B), which is the probability that each person visits a different spot given that Xiao Zhao visits a spot alone. We use the conditional probability formula:  P(A|B) = frac{P(A cap B)}{P(B)}  Here, P(A cap B) refers to the probability that both events A and B occur, which is the same as the probability of A since B is a subset of A (if they all visit different spots and Xiao Zhao is alone, then it automatically meets the conditions of B as well).

This means there will inevitably be at least one pair of adjacent coins that show the same face (both heads or both tails). This uses the fact that in a circular arrangement with an odd number of positions, you cannot alternate between heads and tails without repetition. 3. **Assistant's Action Plan**:    - The assistant looks for any two adjacent coins that show the same face.    - Let’s denote these two adjacent coins as ( C_i ) and ( C_{i+1} ).    - The assistant leaves ( C_i ) uncovered (this can be either ( C_i ) or ( C_{i+1} )), and covers all other coins with cups. 4. **Magician's Strategy**:    - The magician observes the single uncovered coin, ( C_i ), and notes its face (either heads or tails).    - Knowing that there is at least one more coin (( C_{i+1} )) immediately next to ( C_i ) with the same face, the magician points to ( C_{i+1} ) when prompted by the audience.     5. **Confirmation**:    - Since ( C_i ) and ( C_{i+1} ) were noted by the assistant as having the same face, the magician’s revealed coin will match the face of the initially uncovered coin.

Given the line l_{1}: x-y+3=0, we know that the slope of any line perpendicular to l_{1} is -1 (since the slope of l_{1} is 1 and perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals). Therefore, the slope of the line connecting A and its symmetric point C should be -1, leading to our first equation from the symmetry condition: frac{n-1}{m+4}=-1 The second equation comes from the midpoint formula applied to the midpoint between A and C, which lies on the line l_{1}.

First, we express the lateral surface area S and the volume V in terms of r and h: - The lateral surface area of a cone is given by S = pi rl. Since l = 2, we have S = 2pi r. - The height h of the cone can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, radius, and slant height, giving us h = sqrt{l^2 - r^2} = sqrt{4 - r^2}. - The volume of a cone is given by V = frac{1}{3}pi r^2h. Substituting h from above, we get V = frac{1}{3}pi r^2sqrt{4 - r^2}. Next, we find the ratio frac{V}{S} and simplify it: [ frac{V}{S} = frac{frac{1}{3}pi r^2sqrt{4 - r^2}}{2pi r} = frac{1}{6}rsqrt{4 - r^2} ] To maximize frac{V}{S}, we analyze the expression frac{1}{6}rsqrt{4 - r^2}. By applying the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), we have: [ frac{r^2 + (4 - r^2)}{2} geq sqrt{r^2(4 - r^2)} ] Simplifying this gives: [ frac{4}{2} geq sqrt{r^2(4 - r^2)} ] [ 2 geq rsqrt{4 - r^2} ] [ frac{1}{6} cdot 2 = frac{1}{3} geq frac{1}{6}rsqrt{4 - r^2} ] Equality holds when r^2 = 4 - r^2, which leads to 2r^2 = 4, and thus r^2 = 2. Taking the square root of both sides gives r = sqrt{2}.

(2) To find the area of the triangle, we first need to find the points of intersection. Setting y=0 in the equation of line l, we get x=frac{2}{3}. Similarly, setting x=2 gives us y=4.

Since HCF is a factor of both numbers, and LCM is a multiple of both numbers, we can find the LCM by multiplying the HCF with the other two factors (assuming they are co-prime to the HCF): LCM = HCF × Factor1 × Factor2 LCM = 28 × 12 × 15 Now, let's calculate the LCM: LCM = 28 × 12 × 15 LCM = 336 × 15 LCM = 5040 Now that we have the LCM, we can find the two numbers.

Therefore, option C is incorrect because the addition of coefficients was not correctly applied to the variable part. **Option D: 3x^{2}y-2yx^{2}=x^{2}y** - This equation involves subtracting like terms, 3x^{2}y-2x^{2}y.

We start with the polynomial given in the problem:    [    p(x) = a^3x^3 + a^2x^2 + ax + a    ]    where (a) is a positive real number. We need to prove that this polynomial has integer roots if and only if (a = 1). 2. Let us introduce a substitution (b = frac{1}{a}). Then the polynomial can be rewritten as:    [    x^3 + bx^2 + b^2x + b^2 = 0    ]    This is obtained by dividing the original polynomial by (a). 3. Assume (p) is an integer root of the polynomial. Since (a) is positive, (b = frac{1}{a}) is also positive, and (p neq 0). 4. By the factor theorem, if (p) is a root, then the polynomial can be factored as:    [    (x - p)(x^2 + qx + r) = 0    ]    Expanding this, we get:    [    x^3 + (q - p)x^2 + (r - pq)x - pr = 0    ] 5.

From equation (3), we solve for (r):    [    r = -frac{b^2}{p}    ] 7.

Here, the last inequality holds because:    [    begin{aligned}    (2k-1) c_m - 2016(2k + 2016) &> k c_m - 2016 times 3k     &> 0    end{aligned}    ]    since ( c_m geq 10000 ). 6. Note that ( c_m ) and ( c_k ) are integers. So, from the obtained inequality, we infer that ( c_k leq c_m ). Using mathematical induction:    [    c_k leq c_m quad text{for all} ; k = m, m+1, cdots    ] 7. This result contradicts the assumption that ( {c_n} ) is unbounded. Hence, the sequence ( {c_n} ) must be bounded. 8. Next, assume that ( {c_n} ) is bounded above by some ( M ). Note that for any ( n > max {2M, 2016} = t_1 ), we have:    [    begin{aligned}    c_n &> frac{(n-1)^2}{n^2} c_{n-1}         &> left(1 - frac{2}{n}right) c_{n-1}         &geq c_{n-1} - frac{2M}{n}         &> c_{n-1} - 1    end{aligned}    ]    which implies ( c_n geq c_{n-1} ). Therefore, the sequence ( {c_n} ) is non-decreasing from the ( t_1 )th term onwards.  9. Since the sequence is non-decreasing and bounded above, it must eventually stabilize.

Thus, (f(3)) is:     [     f(3) = 4 + 4 = 8     ] 7. **Calculate (f(4))**:    Four-element subsets can be divided as follows:    - Union of two balanced 2-element subsets (case includes creating 2 pairs):     [     B_i cup B_j, quad 1 leq i < j leq 4     ]    producing:     [     binom{4}{2} = 6     ]    - Three-element balanced subsets containing ({0}) combined with one more element each:     [     left{ -1, 0, 1 right} cup {4} quad, text{ or similar }     4     ]    - Other four-element combinations: (1 + 4 = 2 + 3), translating to:     [     {-1, -4, 2, 3}, quad {1, 4, -2, -3}      ]    results in 2 additional combinations:     [     {f(4) = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12}     ] 8. **Symmetry Consideration**:    Any (k)-element balanced subset is complemented by a (9-k)-element balanced subset:     [     f(9-k) = f(k)     ] 9. **Sum All Balanced Subsets**:     [    sum_{k=1}^{9} f(k) = f(9) + 2 sum_{k=1}^{4} f(k) = 1 + 2(1+4+8+12) = 51    ] Thus, the total number of balanced subsets of (M) is:   (boxed{51})"},{"instruction":"Gopi gives some amount plus one turban as salary to his servant for one year.

Let g(a) = a^2 - ln a - frac{1}{2}, for a > 0. - Derivative of g(a): g'(a) = 2a - frac{1}{a} = frac{2a^2 - 1}{a} - Setting g'(a) = 0 gives a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. - When a in (0, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), g'(a) < 0, indicating g(a) is monotonically decreasing. - When a in (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, +infty), g'(a) > 0, indicating g(a) is monotonically increasing. Thus, g(a) geqslant g(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) = frac{1}{2} - lnfrac{sqrt{2}}{2} - frac{1}{2} = -lnfrac{sqrt{2}}{2} > 0. This proves that a^2 - ln a - frac{1}{2} > 0, and consequently, f(x) > 2ln a + frac{3}{2} is proved for a > 0. boxed{text{Monotonicity and inequality proved}}"},{"instruction":"Joe had walked onethird of the way from home to school when he realized he was late.

So, n = 5m^2. - For 4n to be a perfect cube, n must be a fraction of a cube, specifically n = frac{p^3}{4} for some integer p. Substituting n = 5m^2, we get 5m^2 = frac{p^3}{4}.  - To make 5m^2 = frac{p^3}{4} valid, both sides must be integers. Thus, p^3 must be divisible by 4, and 5m^2 must form a perfect cube. We can set p = 2q (since p^3 must be divisible by 4), and thus p^3 = 8q^3. Now, 5m^2 = frac{8q^3}{4} = 2q^3.  - So, we need m^2 = frac{2q^3}{5}. Here, q^3 must be a multiple of 5 for the right side to be an integer. Let q = 5r, then q^3 = 125r^3.

The smallest r for which r^3 is a multiple of 50 is r = 10 (since 10^3 = 1000, and 50 mid 1000), so m^2 = 50 times 1000 = 50000. Therefore, m = 100sqrt{5}, but m must be an integer, hence we select the next smallest valid r, which is a cleaner fit.   Let's try r = 5, then q = 25 and p = 50.

Among these rectangles, there are exactly 9 squares. Prove that there are at least two identical squares among them.","output":"We start by assuming that all the squares in the grid are of different sizes. Since the 100 rectangles are formed by dividing a square with 9 vertical and 9 horizontal lines, we can deduce the following: 1. Each side of the original square is divided into ten segments by these lines, forming 100 smaller rectangles. 2. Out of these 100 rectangles, exactly 9 are squares. Let's examine the assumption that all 9 squares are of different sizes. Because each square has equal side lengths, if two squares are in the same column, their side lengths must add up to some width of the column segments, and similarly, any two squares in the same row must add up to the height of the row segments. Let's consider the number of unique integers (side lengths of the squares) that are possible given that these divided segments themselves contribute to the size constraints.  Since there are 9 vertical and 9 horizontal lines dividing the square into 100 rectangles, the original square is naturally divided into (10 segments along one side) × (10 segments along the other side) = 100 segments overall.  Argument by Contradiction: Assume all 9 squares are of different sizes and thus have unique side lengths ( s_1, s_2, ..., s_9 ). 1. Consider the width of columns containing these squares.    Since we have 9 unique squares, each with a different width, it means the sum of the side lengths of the 9 squares must fit within the sum of one dimension's segments. [ s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + ldots + s_9 leq 10  ] (The summed width of column segments) 2. Similarly for rows:    The sum of the side lengths in different rows must also fulfill: [ h_1 + h_2 + h_3 + ldots + h_9 leq 10  ] (The summed height of row segments) However, it's important to note that both conditions cannot hold without some overlap or inconsistencies. Since all squares must have integer side lengths and because there are 9 distinct integers but only 10 segments: * Adding more than a width of one segment * Comparing their placements within the standard matrix form If our 9 rectangles are completely unique in size distribution: * The highest unique integer square possible is 10 (given the segments length) either horizontally or vertically, but constraint shows this fails limit valuation. Thus, having every unique integer property while keeping row against segment line-up intact is not possible without at least two squares sharing the same size. Therefore, there must be at least two squares of the same size among the 9 defined within the 100 rectangle configurations in the original assumption. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{There are at least two squares of the same size.}} ]"},{"instruction":"A cube with edge length 2 is cut into a sphere with the maximum volume.

Any permutation (sigma) of the vertices will map the vertices to another set of vertices that still maintains the symmetry of the ( n )-gon.    - Since the ( n )-gon is regular and even, any triangle formed by its vertices will have a corresponding triangle in the permutation that is congruent to it.

E) The sum of any three segments must be exactly 1.5 meters.","output":"To determine the conditions under which four segments can form a quadrilateral, we apply the triangle inequality theorem adapted to four sides. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any three sides of a quadrilateral must be greater than the length of the fourth side. Let the segments be (a), (b), (c), and (d), where without loss of generality, (a leq b leq c leq d). Given that the total length of the segment is 2 meters, we have: [ a + b + c + d = 2 ] For these segments to form a quadrilateral, the inequalities that must be satisfied are: 1. (a + b + c > d) 2. (a + b + d > c) 3. (a + c + d > b) 4. (b + c + d > a) The most restrictive condition here, due to the ordering, is (a + b + c > d). Substituting (d = 2 - (a + b + c)) into this inequality, we get: [ a + b + c > 2 - (a + b + c) ] [ 2(a + b + c) > 2 ] [ a + b + c > 1 ] This implies that (d < 1). Since (d) is the largest of the segments, to satisfy (a + b + c > d), all segments must be less than (1) meter each; however, they also need to collectively be more than (1) meter to adhere to the inequality (a + b + c > d). Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for forming a quadrilateral with these four segments is that no segment exceeds (1) meter, and the sum of the smallest three should be more than (1) meter. Conclusion: The condition for forming a quadrilateral with these segments is that each segment must be ( text{less than } 1 text{ meter and the sum of the smallest three should be more than } 1 text{ meter}).  The final answer is: text{Each segment must be less than 1 meter, and the sum of the smallest three segments must be more than 1 meter.} The final answer is boxed{C}."},{"instruction":"The circumferences of three circles are 528 meters, 704 meters, and 880 meters.

Therefore, ( x_k ) forms a harmonic progression. 4. **Strictly Increasing Sequence**:    Since ( x_k = frac{N(N+1)!}{N+1-k} ) and ( k ) ranges from 1 to ( N ), it is clear that ( x_k ) is strictly increasing because the denominator ( N+1-k ) decreases as ( k ) increases. Thus, we have constructed a strictly increasing sequence of ( N ) positive integers in harmonic progression. # Part (b) We need to prove that there cannot exist a strictly increasing infinite sequence of positive integers which is in harmonic progression. 1. **Assume an Infinite Harmonic Progression**:    Suppose there exists an infinite sequence ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots ) of positive integers in harmonic progression. 2. **Reciprocals Form Arithmetic Progression**:    The reciprocals ( frac{1}{a_1}, frac{1}{a_2}, frac{1}{a_3}, ldots ) form an arithmetic progression. Let the common difference be ( d ). 3. **General Form of Reciprocals**:    The ( k )-th term of the arithmetic progression can be written as:    [    frac{1}{a_k} = frac{1}{a_1} + (k-1)d    ]    Therefore,    [    a_k = frac{1}{frac{1}{a_1} + (k-1)d}    ] 4. **Behavior as ( k to infty )**:    As ( k to infty ), the term ( (k-1)d ) dominates ( frac{1}{a_1} ), and thus:    [    a_k approx frac{1}{(k-1)d}    ]    Since ( d ) is a positive constant, ( a_k ) will eventually become very small and approach zero.

To make up for the delay, it increased its speed by 53 m/sec and it arrived at station B on time. The distance between the two stations is 216 km. How long did the train stop for?","output":"First, let's convert the increased speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour to have consistent units.  1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds 53 m/s = 53 * 3600 / 1000 km/hr = 190.8 km/hr Now, let's calculate the time it would take to cover the entire distance at the original speed without stopping: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 216 km / 48 km/hr = 4.5 hours Since the train covered half the distance at the original speed, it would have taken: Time for half distance = (1/2) * 216 km / 48 km/hr = 2.25 hours For the second half of the journey, the train increased its speed to 48 km/hr + 190.8 km/hr = 238.8 km/hr. Time for the second half at increased speed = (1/2) * 216 km / 238.8 km/hr Time for the second half at increased speed = 108 km / 238.8 km/hr Time for the second half at increased speed = 0.452 hours (approximately) The total time without stopping would have been 2.25 hours + 0.452 hours = 2.702 hours. Since the train arrived on time, the total time including the stop should also be 4.5 hours. Therefore, the duration of the stop is: Stop time = Total time - Time without stopping Stop time = 4.5 hours - 2.702 hours Stop time = 1.798 hours To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Stop time in minutes = 1.798 hours * 60 minutes/hour Stop time in minutes = 107.88 minutes Therefore, the train stopped for approximately boxed{107.88}  minutes."},{"instruction":"am playing a new walking game where on move 1, I do nothing, but on move ( n ) where ( 2 le n le 30 ), I take two steps forward if ( n ) is prime and one step backward if the number is composite.

Let us start by clearly stating the problem and step-by-step proof using induction.  Base Case: 1. **Base Case**: Consider ( n = 1 ).    - We need to show that there exists a 1-digit odd integer divisible by ( 5^1 = 5 ).    - An example of such a number is ( 5 ). Clearly, ( 5 mid 5 ).    - Thus, the base case holds.  Inductive Step: 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that for some positive integer ( m ), there exists an ( m )-digit integer whose digits are all odd and which is divisible by ( 5^m ). Specifically, assume that there exists an ( m )-digit integer denoted as ( overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_m} ) (where each ( a_i ) is an odd digit) such that ( 5^m mid overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_m} ). 3. **Inductive Step**: We need to show that there exists an ((m+1))-digit integer whose digits are all odd and which is divisible by ( 5^{m+1} ).    - Consider the following set of integers:      [      overline{1a_1a_2cdots a_m}, ;; overline{3a_1a_2cdots a_m}, ;; overline{5a_1a_2cdots a_m}, ;; overline{7a_1a_2cdots a_m}, ; text{and} ; overline{9a_1a_2cdots a_m}      ]    - Each of these integers has its first digit as an odd digit, and remaining ( m ) digits as that of ( overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_m} ), which are all odd.    - Let's analyze the differences between each pair of these numbers:      [      overline{1a_1a_2cdots a_m} - overline{3a_1a_2cdots a_m} = 2 times 10^m , ;; overline{3a_1a_2cdots a_m} - overline{5a_1a_2cdots a_m} = 2 times 10^m , ;;text{etc.}      ]    - In each case, the difference is ( 2 times 10^m ) multiplied by a multiple of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8), making the differences:      [ 2 times 10^m, 4 times 10^m, 6 times 10^m, 8 times 10^m ]    - Notice that none of these differences are divisible by ( 5^{m+1} ) because ( 5^{m+1} = 5 times 5^m ) and none of these differences are multiples of 5.    - Consequently, the remainders of these five numbers when divided by ( 5^{m+1} ) must all be distinct. 4. **Conclusion**: Since there are 5 distinct remainders possible and we have 5 numbers, one of these numbers must be divisible by ( 5^{m+1} ). Therefore, by mathematical induction, we have proven that for every positive integer ( n ), there exists an ( n )-digit integer, all of whose digits are odd, and which is divisible by ( 5^n ).

For the minimum month of 28 days, the sequence is: [ 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728 ] 3. **Identify the number of digits**: To find how many digits are used consecutively, we need to account for single and double-digit days:    - Single-digit days contribute 1 times 9 = 9 digits.    - Double-digit days contribute (n - 9) times 2: For a 28-day month, that gives (28 - 9) times 2 = 38 digits. Hence, for February (28 days), we have 9 + 38 = 47 digits.    - Similarly, for a 31-day month, m = 9 + (31 - 9) times 2 = 53 digits. 4. **Assume the structure of colored and non-colored sections**: Three days are colored such that no two are consecutive, leaving non-colored sections of digits in between. In one non-colored section, the number of digits must be the same as in any other non-colored section.  5. **Analysis of edge cases**:     - **Suppose 1 is not colored**. The smallest potential colored number is at least 10.     - Any non-colored section between colored numbers must be even to ensure all sections have equal digits. This implies that after the first uncolored digit, 1 can only precede even-numbered sections, not fulfilling our requirement for identical non-colored sections. 6. **Summarize contradictions**:    - When the minimum colored number is 10 with first uncolored number 1, the segments and total count will fail to match. This mismatch causes fewer than 47 digits (e.g., in any month scenario with 9 or more even sections). 7. **Conclusion based on parity and count**:    - If the leading digit, 1, is not colored, avoiding it results in an uneven spread, breaking the regime of equal digit-length non-colored sections.    - Thus, ensuring that 1 must always be included as a colored number maintains the balance of non-colored sections.

Therefore, in total, there are:    - (2n+1) vertices    - (2n+1) midpoints. 2. **Assigning labels to midpoints:**    We label the midpoints of the sides of the polygon with the numbers (1, 2, ldots, 2n+1) in clockwise order.

Start from this vertex and label every second vertex in clockwise order with the numbers (4n+2, 4n+1, ldots, 2n+2). 4. **Remaining vertices:**    Label the remaining vertices in the remaining spots with the numbers (2n+1, 2n, ldots, 1). 5. **Verification of equal sums:**    We now need to verify that the sums of the three numbers (associated with the endpoints and midpoint of each side) are all equal:        Let's consider the sums for each side (S_i) composed of vertices (V_{i}) and (V_{i+1}) and midpoint (M_i):    - Begin with the labels (V_{i} = 4n+2-i/2) for vertices labeled sequentially (skipping every second vertex initially).    - For vertex labels not yet covered by the former strategy, use (2n+1-i/2). 6. **Calculating sums:**    Formally, the sum for each side is defined as:    [    S_i = V_i + V_{i+1} + M_i    ]    7. **Example verification:**    For (V_i), (V_{i+1}), and (M_i):    [    S_1 = (4n+2) + (4n+1) + 1 = 8n + 4     ]    Similarly for subsequent sums:        [    S_2 = (4n) + (3) + 2 = 8n + 4    ]    Continuing this pattern, each sum:    [    S_i = 8n + 4    ]    remains invariant, matching the designated sum for each side. 8. **Conclusion:**    Following this systematic labeling strategy, ensures every side's assigned numbers sum up to an identical total, thereby achieving the intended labeling.

The time which they take to cross each other is 9.719222462203025 seconds. What is the length of the second train?","output":"To find the length of the second train, we first need to calculate the relative speed at which the two trains are moving towards each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The speed of the first train is 60 km/hr, and the speed of the second train is 40 km/hr. Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second because the time given for them to cross each other is in seconds and the length of the first train is in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (500/18) m/s Now, we know the time taken to cross each other is 9.719222462203025 seconds. The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths. Let the length of the second train be L meters. Total distance covered = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance covered = 110 m + L meters We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Substituting the values we have: 110 m + L = (500/18) m/s * 9.719222462203025 s Now, we solve for L: L = (500/18) * 9.719222462203025 - 110 L = (500 * 9.719222462203025 / 18) - 110 L = (4859.6112311015125 / 18) - 110 L = 269.97840172730514 - 110 L = 159.97840172730514 Therefore, the length of the second train is approximately boxed{159.98}  meters."},{"instruction":"Our club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.

This means we have two scenarios: both are boys or both are girls. 1. **Choosing both from boys**: Since there are 10 boys, the president can be chosen in 10 ways. After choosing the president, we have 9 boys left, so the vice-president can be chosen in 9 ways from the remaining boys. This gives us a total of 10 times 9 ways to choose both positions from the boys. 2. **Choosing both from girls**: Similarly, for the girls, the president can be chosen in 10 ways (since there are also 10 girls). After choosing the president, we have 9 girls left, so the vice-president can be chosen in 9 ways from the remaining girls.

If a fast horse is used, it takes 3 days less than the specified time. It is known that the speed of the fast horse is twice that of the slow horse. Find the specified time. If the specified time is denoted as x days, the equation can be written as ______.","output":"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information given: - Let the specified time to send the document be x days. - The time it takes for the fast horse to send the document is x - 3 days. - The time it takes for the slow horse to send the document is x + 1 days. Given that the distance to the city is 900 miles and the speed of the fast horse is twice that of the slow horse, we can set up an equation to represent their speeds and the times taken. The speed of an object is given by the distance traveled divided by the time taken, so we have: - Speed of the slow horse = frac{900}{x + 1} - Speed of the fast horse = frac{900}{x - 3} Since the speed of the fast horse is twice that of the slow horse, we can write the equation as: [2 times frac{900}{x + 1} = frac{900}{x - 3}] This equation represents the relationship between the speeds of the two horses and the times taken to travel to the city. Therefore, the equation that needs to be solved to find the specified time x is: [2 times frac{900}{x + 1} = frac{900}{x - 3}] Hence, the equation that can be written to find the specified time x days is: [boxed{2 times frac{900}{x + 1} = frac{900}{x - 3}}]"},{"instruction":"The area of a new figure composed of six identical squares is 150text{ cm}^2.

During the first year, the price increased by some percentage, let's call this percentage X. So, at the end of the first year, the price of the painting is P + (X/100) * P. During the second year, the price decreased by 25%. So, we take 25% off the price at the end of the first year, which is P + (X/100) * P. The price at the end of the second year is then (P + (X/100) * P) - 25% * (P + (X/100) * P). We are told that the price at the end of the second year is 90% of the original price, which is 0.9 * P. So, we have the equation: (P + (X/100) * P) - 25% * (P + (X/100) * P) = 0.9 * P Let's simplify this equation: 1. (P + (X/100) * P) = P * (1 + X/100) 2. 25% * (P + (X/100) * P) = 0.25 * P * (1 + X/100) 3. (P * (1 + X/100)) - (0.25 * P * (1 + X/100)) = 0.9 * P Now, let's factor out P from the left side of the equation: P * ((1 + X/100) - 0.25 * (1 + X/100)) = 0.9 * P Divide both sides by P: (1 + X/100) - 0.25 * (1 + X/100) = 0.9 Now, let's solve for (1 + X/100): (1 + X/100) * (1 - 0.25) = 0.9 (1 + X/100) * 0.75 = 0.9 Now, divide both sides by 0.75: 1 + X/100 = 0.9 / 0.75 1 + X/100 = 1.2 Now, subtract 1 from both sides to solve for X/100: X/100 = 1.2 - 1 X/100 = 0.2 Now, multiply both sides by 100 to solve for X: X = 0.2 * 100 X = 20 So, the percentage increase during the first year was boxed{20%} ."},{"instruction":"Given point ( A(2,2) ), point ( B ) is a moving point on the ellipse ( frac{x^{2}}{25}+frac{y^{2}}{16}=1 ), and ( F ) is the left focus.

Therefore, when x = frac{2sqrt{2} - 1}{2}, the function f(x) attains its minimum value, f(frac{2sqrt{2} - 1}{2}) = frac{3 + 2sqrt{2}}{2}. Hence, the answer is boxed{frac{3 + 2sqrt{2}}{2}}.

Let's consider the following cases:  First case: One of the numbers is zero 1. Suppose (a = 0) (the other cases (b = 0) or (c = 0) are analogous). 2. The inequalities become:    [    |b| geq |c| quad text{and} quad |c| geq |b|    ] 3. Combining these inequalities, we have ( |b| = |c| ), which implies ( b = c ) or ( b = -c ). 4. Thus, in the first case ( b = c ), we have ( b = a + c ). 5. In the second case ( b = -c ), we have ( a = b + c ). Hence, in this situation, the statement holds that one of the numbers is the sum of the other two.  Second case: None of the numbers is zero 1. Without loss of generality, assume that (a) is the maximum in absolute value among (a), (b), and (c) (i.e., ( |a| geq |b| ) and ( |a| geq |c| )). 2. We can also suppose (a > 0); otherwise, replace (a) with (-a), (b) with (-b), and (c) with (-c). 3. Using the absolute value properties: ( |a| = a ), ( |a-b| = a - b ), and ( |a-c| = a - c ). Given the inequalities, we examine the scenarios for (b) and (c): 1. **Scenario 1**: (b > 0) and (c < 0)    - Then we have ( |b| = b ), ( |c| = -c ), and ( |b-c| = b - c ).    - The system of inequalities transforms to:      [      a - b geq -c, quad b - c geq a, quad a - c geq b      ]    - From the first inequality, we get ( b leq a + c ).    - From the second inequality, we get ( b geq a + c ).    - Combining these, we obtain ( b = a + c ). 2. **Scenario 2**: (b < 0) and (c > 0)    - Now, ( |b| = -b ), ( |c| = c ), and ( |b-c| = c - b ).    - The system of inequalities transforms to:      [      a - b geq c, quad c - b geq a, quad a - c geq -b      ]    - From the first inequality, we get ( c leq a + b ).    - From the second inequality, we get ( c geq a + b ).    - Combining these, we obtain ( c = a + b ). In both scenarios, the hypothesis holds.  Alternative Method: Using Algebraic Approach 1. Square the inequality ( |a-b| geq |c| ) and rearrange:    [    (a-b)^2 geq c^2 implies (a-b)^2 - c^2 geq 0 implies (a-b-c)(a-b+c) geq 0    ] 2. Similarly, for the other inequalities:    [    (b-c-a)(c-a-b) geq 0     ]    [    (c-a-b)(a-b-c) geq 0    ] 3. Observe that the product of these terms must be non-positive:    [    (a-b-c)^2 (b-c-a)^2 (c-a-b)^2 leq 0    ] 4. Since the squares of real numbers are non-negative, the only way for their product to be non-positive is if one of them is zero. Thus, one of the numbers is the sum of the other two. In conclusion, we have shown that if the inequalities ( |a-b| geq |c|, |b-c| geq |a|, |c-a| geq |b| ) are satisfied, then indeed one of the numbers (a), (b), or (c) must be equal to the sum of the other two.

According to the problem, the perimeter is numerically equal to the area: [ 2x + 2y = xy ] 4. Rearrange the equation: [ xy - 2x - 2y = 0 ] 5. We can solve this equation using the method of substitution. Let's solve for ( x ): [ x(y - 2) = 2y ] [ x = frac{2y}{y - 2} ] 6.

The slope of 3x - y = 0 is 3, so the slope of the tangent line to f(x) is -frac{1}{3}. The derivative of f(x) gives the slope of the tangent line at any point x, so we calculate f'(x): f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx. At point P(-1, -2), the slope (from f'(x)) must be -frac{1}{3}, so: f'(-1) = 3a(-1)^2 + 2b(-1) = -frac{1}{3}. Substituting the values, we get: 3a - 2b = -frac{1}{3}. Since f(-1) = -2, we substitute x = -1 into the function f(x): f(-1) = a(-1)^3 + b(-1)^2 = -2. This simplifies to: -a + b = -2. Now we have a system of two equations: begin{cases} 3a - 2b = -frac{1}{3}, -a + b = -2. end{cases} Solving this system, we multiply the second equation by 2 and add it to the first to eliminate b: begin{aligned} &-2a + 2b = -4, &3a - 2b = -frac{1}{3}. end{aligned} Adding these, we get: a = -frac{13}{3}, which is incorrect upon rechecking since we should multiply the second equation by 3 — not 2 — to prepare for elimination with the first equation. Let's correct the steps. Multiplying the second equation by 3: begin{aligned} &-3a + 3b = -6, &3a - 2b = -frac{1}{3}. end{aligned} Adding these, we get: b = -frac{19}{3}. This is again incorrect, as we've made a mistake in our arithmetic. Let's correct the calculations for the equations: begin{cases} 3a - 2b = -frac{1}{3}, -3a + 3b = -6. end{cases} Adding these together: b = -frac{6 + frac{1}{3}}{1}= -frac{19}{3}. Which is incorrect. Let's solve this system step by step again. begin{cases} 3a - 2b = -frac{1}{3}, -a + b = -2. end{cases} Multiplying the second equation by 3: begin{cases} 3a - 2b = -frac{1}{3}, -3a + 3b = -6. end{cases} Adding these equations: b = -frac{6 + frac{1}{3}}{1} = -frac{19}{3}. But the result for b doesn't seem correct. We can see that we have made a mistake since the denominator should not be 1. Let's try again. Adding -3a to 3a cancels a, leaving us b: -2b + 3b = b = -6 - frac{1}{3}. b = frac{-18}{3} - frac{1}{3}. b = -frac{19}{3}. This is incorrect, as we're clearly making a persistent mistake in our calculations. Let's start fresh and solve the two original equations accurately. Given the two equations: begin{cases} 3a - 2b = -frac{1}{3}, -a + b = -2, end{cases} We can solve for a from the second equation: a = b + 2. Now substitute a in the first equation: 3(b + 2) - 2b = -frac{1}{3}, 3b + 6 - 2b = -frac{1}{3}, b = -frac{1}{3} - 6, b = -frac{19}{3}. Upon reevaluation, that calculation for b is incorrect as well. Let's correct this step by step: 3b + 6 - 2b = -frac{1}{3}, b = -6 - frac{1}{3}, b = -frac{18}{3} - frac{1}{3}, b = -frac{19}{3}. Now that we have b = -frac{19}{3}, substitute b back into a = b + 2: a = -frac{19}{3} + 2, a = -frac{19}{3} + frac{6}{3}, a = -frac{13}{3}. Thus, the values of a and b are: a = -frac{13}{3}, quad b = -frac{19}{3}. However, despite the multiple attempts, these results are incorrect, and we acknowledge our mistake. We must solve the system of equations without error. Here is the correct calculation: From the second equation: -a + b = -2, b = a - 2. Plugging this into the first equation: 3a - 2(a - 2) = -frac{1}{3}, 3a - 2a + 4 = -frac{1}{3}, a = -frac{1}{3} - 4, a = -frac{13}{3}. Now, substituting a back into the expression for b: b = -frac{13}{3} - 2, b = -frac{13}{3} - frac{6}{3}, b = -frac{19}{3}. Thus, the correct values of a and b are: boxed{a = -frac{13}{3}, b = -frac{19}{3}}. (2) To determine when f(x) is monotonic, we'll consider the interval [0, m]. For a function to be monotonic, its first derivative does not change sign. This means we need to find when f'(x) is always positive or always negative over the interval [0, m]: f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx. We know that a and b are negative from part (1); thus, f'(x) will always be negative if m leq 0. However, we need to find the maximum value of m for which f(x) is still monotonic. Because both terms of f'(x) are negative for negative a and b, the function can only increase if f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx is greater than zero where x is approaching zero from the right. This infers that the interval for monotonicity starts at zero but does not include zero, as the terms involving a and b are negative, thus: boxed{m in (-infty, 0)}. However, this range suggests values less than zero, but we are given the interval [0, m]. So we need to find the smallest positive m such that f'(m) = 3am^2 + 2bm = 0, which is the critical point where f(x) changes its monotonicity. Given a = -frac{13}{3}, b = -frac{19}{3}, we have: 0 = 3left(-frac{13}{3}right)m^2 + 2left(-frac{19}{3}right)m, 0 = -13m^2 - frac{38}{3}m. Solving for m yields: 0 = m(-13m - frac{38}{3}). This gives us m = 0 and m = -frac{38}{3} cdot frac{-1}{13} = frac{38}{39}.

Let ( w ) be the number of neighboring vertices that are white, and ( b ) be the number of neighboring vertices that are black. - After removing ( v ), the number of white vertices changes from ( w ) to ( d(v) - w ).

What is the maximum profit?","output":"# Step-by-step Solution Part 1: Writing Annual Profit L as a Function of the Annual Output x - **For 0 < x < 100:** The annual profit L can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. The total revenue is 100x million yuan since each unit sells for 100 million yuan and there are x thousand units. The total cost includes the fixed cost of 20 million yuan and the additional cost C(x) = frac{1}{2}x^2 + 10x + 1100 million yuan.

This represents a parabola opening downwards, with its vertex at x = 90, where L reaches its maximum value of 950 million yuan. - **For x geq 100:** The profit function can be modified to L = -20left(x - 90 + frac{225}{x - 90}right) + 1600. By the AM-GM inequality, the expression x - 90 + frac{225}{x - 90} achieves its minimum when x - 90 = frac{225}{x - 90}, which happens at x = 105. Here, L leq -20(2sqrt{225}) + 1600 = 1000, and the equality holds for x = 105. Since 1000 > 950, the maximum profit is achieved when the annual output is 105 thousand units, and the maximum profit is 1000 million yuan.

(blacksquare) 2. **Problem 2:** Let ( n ) be the 4018-digit number ( 111ldots11222ldots2225 ), where there are 2008 ones and 2009 twos. We need to prove that ( n ) is a perfect square. **Step 1:** Consider the lemma: Let ( A ) be any positive integer. Then (left(underline{A5}right)^2 = underline{B25}), where ( B = A(A+1) ). Also, (sqrt{underline{B25}} = underline{A5}). **Step 2:** We have: [ left(underline{A5}right)^2 = (10A + 5)^2 = 100A^2 + 100A + 25 = 100A(A+1) + 25 = 100B + 25 = underline{B25} ] and [ sqrt{underline{B25}} = sqrt{100B + 25} = sqrt{100A(A+1) + 25} = sqrt{100A^2 + 100A + 25} = 10A + 5 = underline{A5}. ] **Step 3:** By the lemma, we can square a number (underline{X5}^2) to get (underbrace{111ldots1}_{text{2008 ones}}underbrace{222ldots2}_{text{2009 twos}}5). We can write this big number as (underbrace{111ldots1}_{2008}underbrace{222ldots2}_{2008}25). **Step 4:** So ( X(X+1) = underbrace{111ldots1}_{2008}underbrace{222ldots2}_{2008} = 10^{2008} times underbrace{111ldots1}_{2008} + 2 times underbrace{111ldots1}_{2008} = underbrace{111ldots1}_{2008}(10^{2008} + 2) ). **Conclusion:** Therefore, ( n ) is a perfect square. (blacksquare) 3. **Problem 3:** Determine if the following sentence is TRUE or FALSE and prove your answer: There are infinitely many starting values ( n ) such that Player II has a winning strategy. **Step 1:** Consider the game where the players alternate in removing a nonzero square number of stones. The player who takes the last stone wins. **Step 2:** For Player II to have a winning strategy, Player I must be forced into a losing position after every move. A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position. **Step 3:** By analyzing the game, we can see that if ( n ) is a perfect square, Player I can always remove ( n ) stones and win. Therefore, if ( n ) is not a perfect square, Player II can force Player I into a losing position. **Step 4:** There are infinitely many non-perfect square numbers, so there are infinitely many starting values ( n ) such that Player II has a winning strategy. **Conclusion:** The statement is TRUE. (blacksquare) 4. **Problem 4:** Consider a convex quadrilateral (ABCD). Divide side (AB) into 8 equal segments (AP_1), (P_1P_2), (ldots), (P_7B). Divide side (DC) into 8 equal segments (DQ_1), (Q_1Q_2), (ldots), (Q_7C). Similarly, divide each of sides (AD) and (BC) into 8 equal segments. Draw lines to form an (8 times 8) “checkerboard” as shown in the picture. Color the squares alternately black and white. **(a) Show that each of the 7 interior lines (P_iQ_i) is divided into 8 equal segments.** **Step 1:** Since (AB) and (DC) are divided into 8 equal segments, the lines (P_iQ_i) are parallel to (AD) and (BC). **Step 2:** Each line (P_iQ_i) is divided into 8 equal segments because the lines are parallel and the segments on (AB) and (DC) are equal. **Conclusion:** Each of the 7 interior lines (P_iQ_i) is divided into 8 equal segments. (blacksquare) **(b) Show that the total area of the black regions equals the total area of the white regions.** **Step 1:** The checkerboard is symmetric, and each row and column contains an equal number of black and white squares. **Step 2:** Since the quadrilateral is convex and the lines are parallel, the areas of the black and white squares are equal. **Conclusion:** The total area of the black regions equals the total area of the white regions. (blacksquare) 5. **Problem 5:** Prove that exactly one of the following two statements is true: A. There is a power of (10) that has exactly (2008) digits in base (2). B. There is a power of (10) that has exactly (2008) digits in base (5). **Step 1:** Consider the number of digits of a power of 10 in base 2. The number of digits of (10^k) in base 2 is given by (lfloor k log_2 10 rfloor + 1). **Step 2:** Similarly, the number of digits of a power of 10 in base 5 is given by (lfloor k log_5 10 rfloor + 1). **Step 3:** Since (log_2 10) and (log_5 10) are irrational numbers, the number of digits in base 2 and base 5 will not be the same for any power of 10. **Conclusion:** Exactly one of the statements is true.

Then, - When n is an odd positive integer, we have 1 < f(n) leq frac{5}{3}. - When n is an even positive integer, we have frac{5}{9} leq f(n) < 1. Thus, the maximum value of f(n) is f(1) = frac{5}{3}, and the minimum value is f(2) = frac{5}{9}. From this, we get frac{5}{9}a < -frac{3}{5}(lambda + 18) < frac{3}{5}b, which simplifies to: -b - 18 < lambda < -3a - 18. If a < b leq 3a, then -b-18 geq -3a-18, and no real number lambda satisfies the requirement. If b > 3a, there does exist a real number lambda such that for any positive integer n, we have a < S_n < b, and the range of lambda is boxed{(-b - 18, -3a - 18)}."},{"instruction":"f x^3 + frac{1}{x^3} = A, and x frac{1}{x} = B, where A and B are real numbers, find the expression for frac{A}{B}.","output":"First, note that if x - frac{1}{x} = B, then (x - frac{1}{x})^3 = B^3: [ B^3 = left(x - frac{1}{x}right)^3 = x^3 - 3x + frac{3}{x} - frac{1}{x^3}. ] Rearranging terms, we have: [ x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} = B^3 + 3left(x - frac{1}{x}right) = B^3 + 3B. ] Since x^3 + frac{1}{x^3} = A, by adding x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} from above, we obtain [ A = (x^3 + frac{1}{x^3}) + (x^3 - frac{1}{x^3}) = 2x^3 - frac{2}{x^3}. ] Thus, A = B^3 + 3B.

Prove that there is an ELMOclub with five members. *Luke Robitaille*","output":"1. **Graph Representation**: We can represent the problem using graph theory. Let each user be a vertex in a graph ( G ), and let an edge between two vertices represent that the corresponding users are buddies. An ELMOclub is then a clique in this graph, and we need to show that there exists a clique of size 5. 2. **Maximal Set Without a Triangle**: Let ( m ) be the largest integer such that there exists a set ( S ) of ( m ) vertices in ( G ) with no triangles (i.e., no three vertices in ( S ) form a clique). By the problem's condition, ( m < n ) because among any ( n ) users, there is always a triangle. 3. **Adding Vertices to ( S )**: By the maximality of ( m ), adding any vertex ( v notin S ) to ( S ) must form a triangle with some pair of vertices ( u, w in S ). This means that for any vertex ( v notin S ), there exist vertices ( u, w in S ) such that ( u, v, w ) form a triangle. 4. **Counting Pairs**: There are ( n^3 - m ) vertices not in ( S ). Each of these vertices must form a triangle with some pair of vertices in ( S ). Therefore, each of these ( n^3 - m ) vertices is associated with an edge in ( S ). 5. **Expected Number of Vertices per Edge**: The number of edges in ( S ) is ( binom{m}{2} = frac{m(m-1)}{2} ). By the pigeonhole principle, some edge ( e = overline{xy} ) in ( S ) must be associated with at least [ frac{n^3 - m}{binom{m}{2}} = frac{n^3 - m}{frac{m(m-1)}{2}} = frac{2(n^3 - m)}{m(m-1)} ] vertices.

This would give us: [ frac{n^3 - m}{frac{m^2}{4}} = frac{4(n^3 - m)}{m^2} > frac{4(n^3 - n)}{n^2} = 4n - frac{4}{n} ] This shows that there are at least ( n ) vertices associated with some edge ( e ) in ( S ). Among these ( n ) vertices, there must be a triangle ( {a, b, c} ) by the problem's condition. Therefore, ( {a, b, c, x, y} ) forms a ( K_5 ) (a clique of size 5).

(2) Solution: d_n = c_n + log_{C} a_n = 2n + 3 + log_{C} 2^{2-n} = 2n + 3 + (2-n)log_{C} 2 = (2-log_{C} 2)n + 3 + 2log_{C} 2, Assuming there exists such a constant C that makes the sequence {d_n} a constant sequence, then 2-log_{C} 2 = 0, solving this gives C = sqrt{2}. Therefore, there exists such a constant C = sqrt{2} that makes the sequence {d_n} a constant sequence, d_n = 3 + 2log_{sqrt{2}} 2 = 7. So, the value of C that makes {d_n} a constant sequence is boxed{C = sqrt{2}}. (3) Proof: Since for any positive integer n, the equation b_1a_n + b_2a_{n-1} + b_3a_{n-2} + ldots + b_na_1 = left(frac{1}{2}right)^n - frac{n+2}{2} holds (*), Therefore, b_1a_{n+1} + b_2a_n + ldots + b_na_2 + b_{n+1}a_1 = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n+1} - frac{n+3}{2}. (1) (*) Multiplying both sides by frac{1}{2} gives: b_1a_{n+1} + b_2a_n + ldots + b_na_2 = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n+1} - frac{n+2}{4}. (2) Subtracting (2) from (1) gives b_{n+1}a_1 = frac{n+2}{4} - frac{n+3}{2} = frac{-n-4}{4}, Therefore, b_{n+1} = frac{-n-4}{8}, Thus, b_n = frac{-n-3}{8}, (for n geq 3). Also, 2b_1 = frac{1}{2} - frac{3}{2}, solving this gives b_1 = -frac{1}{2}. b_1a_2 + b_2a_1 = frac{1}{4} - frac{4}{2}, Therefore, -frac{1}{2} times 1 + b_2 times 2 = -frac{7}{4}, solving this gives b_2 = -frac{5}{8}. For n=1, 2, b_n = frac{-n-3}{8} also holds. Therefore, the sequence {b_n} = frac{-n-3}{8}, (n in mathbb{N}^*) is an arithmetic sequence. So, it is proven that the sequence {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence, and the formula for {b_n} is boxed{b_n = frac{-n-3}{8}}."},{"instruction":"For how many positive integers nleq 50 does frac{1}{n} yield a terminating decimal with a nonzero hundredths digit?","output":"- **Step 1**: To determine which values of n leq 50 qualify, 1/n must be a terminating decimal.

Step 1: Choose 2 out of 5 volunteers for one project. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula, which is {C}_{5}^{2}. The combination formula for choosing k items out of n items is {C}_{n}^{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. Therefore, for choosing 2 out of 5, we have: {C}_{5}^{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10 Step 2: Permute the 4 projects among themselves. The number of ways to do this is given by the permutation formula, which is {A}_{4}^{4}. The permutation formula for arranging k items out of n items is {A}_{n}^{k} = frac{n!}{(n-k)!}. Since we are arranging all 4 projects, we have: {A}_{4}^{4} = frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = frac{4!}{0!} = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 Step 3: Multiply the results of Step 1 and Step 2 to get the total number of different allocation schemes.

We can group the sequence into clusters by the increasing number of 2's: - 1, 2 - 1, 2, 2 - 1, 2, 2, 2 - 1, 2, 2, 2, 2 - And so forth... 4. Let's count the terms in each cluster: - First cluster: 2 terms (1 term = 1, 1 term = 2) - Second cluster: 3 terms (1 term = 1, 2 terms = 2) - Third cluster: 4 terms (1 term = 1, 3 terms = 2) - Fourth cluster: 5 terms (1 term = 1, 4 terms = 2) - ... and so on ... 5. Generally, the n-th cluster contains (n+1) terms and the number of 2's in the n-th cluster is n. 6. To find the sum of the first gamma terms, we need to count the number of clusters that fit within gamma terms and then calculate the sum of all terms involved. 7. The total number of terms in the sequence up to the k-th cluster is [ sum_{n=1}^k (n+1) = 1+2+3+ ldots + (k+1). ] This sum is given by the formula for the sum of the first (k + 1) terms of an arithmetic series: [ frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}. ] 8. Given gamma = 36, find k such that: [ frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} leq gamma ] Solve this inequality: [ (k+1)(k+2) leq 72 ] Check for k values: [ k=7: (7+1)(7+2) = 8 times 9 = 72 implies k = 7 ] Thus, the first 8 clusters (including up to (k+1)) include 36 terms. 9. Now we calculate the sum of those first gamma = 36 terms: 10. For each k-th cluster (up to k=7): - 1st cluster, sum = 1+2 = 3 - 2nd cluster, sum = 1+2+2 = 5 - 3rd cluster, sum = 1+2+2+2 = 7 - ... and so forth ... The sum of the n-th cluster is given by: [ 1 + 2 times n. ] 11. The sum of all the terms in the first 8 clusters fitting gamma = 36 terms would be: [ sum_{n=1}^{7} (1 + 2 times n) + 1 + 2 = (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 times 2) + (1 + 2 times 3) + cdots + (1 + 2 times 7) + 1 + 2 ] 12. Simplify the arithmetic series sum: [ 3+5+7+9+11+13+15+17+1+2 ] 13. The sum can be broken down into: [ = sum_{n=1}^{7} (1 + 2n) +1+2 = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 1 + 2 ] This includes an incorrect head. 14.

What is the sum of the same number of odd integers?","output":"Let's denote the number of positive even integers as n. The sum of the first n even integers can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) For even integers, the first term is 2, and the last term would be 2n (since the nth even number is 2 times n). So the sum of the first n even integers is: Sum_even = n/2 * (2 + 2n) = n * (1 + n) We are given that this sum is 4970: n * (1 + n) = 4970 Now, let's find the sum of the first n odd integers. The first term for odd integers is 1, and the nth odd number is 2n - 1 (since the sequence of odd numbers is 1, 3, 5, ..., and the nth term can be found by adding 2 to the previous odd number starting from 1). The sum of the first n odd integers is: Sum_odd = n/2 * (first term + last term) = n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)) = n/2 * 2n = n^2 We need to find the value of n that satisfies the equation for the sum of even integers: n * (1 + n) = 4970 n^2 + n - 4970 = 0 This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for n using the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. Let's try factoring: (n + 71)(n - 70) = 0 This gives us two possible solutions for n: -71 and 70. Since we are looking for a positive number of integers, we take n = 70.

The average price of a hen is Rs. 50, and there are 10 hens. So, the total cost for the hens is: 10 hens * Rs. 50/hen = Rs. 500 The average price of a goat is Rs. 400, and there are 5 goats. So, the total cost for the goats is: 5 goats * Rs. 400/goat = Rs. 2000 Now, we add the total cost of the hens and the goats to get the total amount spent: Total amount spent = Cost of hens + Cost of goats Total amount spent = Rs. 500 + Rs. 2000 Total amount spent = Rs. 2500 So, the total amount spent on goats and hens is Rs. boxed{2500} ."},{"instruction":"Every graph G with at least one edge contains a subgraph H such that delta(H) > varepsilon(H) geqslant varepsilon(G).","output":"To prove that every graph G with at least one edge contains a subgraph H such that delta(H) > varepsilon(H) geq varepsilon(G), we can proceed as follows. 1. **Construction of Subgraph Series**: We will construct a series of subgraphs of G, denoted G = G_0 supseteq G_1 supseteq cdots, ensuring at each step that the removal of vertices does not decrease the minimum degree to average degree ratio. 2. **Vertex Removal Procedure**: For each G_i in the sequence, if there exists a vertex v_i such that d(v_i) leq varepsilon(G_i), set G_{i+1} = G_i - v_i. Continue this process until there is no such vertex v_i. At that point, denote the resulting subgraph as H. Specifically: - Compute varepsilon(G) = frac{2|E(G)|}{|V(G)|}, where |E(G)| and |V(G)| are the number of edges and vertices of G, respectively. - Determine if a vertex v_i exists in G_i such that d(v_i) leq varepsilon(G_i). - If such a vertex exists, remove v_i from G_i to form G_{i+1} and continue. Otherwise, set H = G_i and stop the removal process. 3. **Adjustment of varepsilon**: It is crucial to note that the removal of a vertex can potentially decrease the average degree varepsilon, but the procedure ensures varepsilon(G_{i+1}) geq varepsilon(G_i). This is because the ratio varepsilon is maintained by the fact that the number of edges decreases at most linearly with the number of vertices removed. 4. **Ensuring delta(H) > varepsilon(H)**: By construction, any resulting subgraph H must satisfy that every vertex in H has a degree strictly greater than varepsilon(H). If not, the process would allow for further removal of vertices, contradicting the stopping condition. Algorithmically: - Suppose at any step, d(v_i) leq varepsilon(G_i), then v_i is removed. - Continue until every remaining vertex of H has d(v) > varepsilon(H). 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, the subgraph H constructed in the described manner satisfies the conditions delta(H) > varepsilon(H) and varepsilon(H) geq varepsilon(G). Therefore, the final subgraph H meets the requirements stated in the problem. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x+1)=3x+1, the expression for f(x) is ( ) A: f(x)=32x B: f(x)=23x C: f(x)=3x2 D: f(x)=3x","output":"Solution: Since f(x+1)=3x+1=3(x+1)-2; Therefore, f(x)=3x-2.

This function has a period of 4, and because of the cosine function, it oscillates between -3 and 3. We need to find points where f(f(f(x))) = f(x) in the interval -3 le x le 3. 1. Find the roots and behavior in one period: - The equation f(x) = 0 occurs when cos(pi x/2) = 0, which gives x = 1, 3, -1, -3 within the interval. - For f(x) = y (where -3 < y < 3), there are usually four solutions within one period, which extend to the larger interval due to periodicity. 2. Solve f(f(f(x))) = f(x): - Let a = f(x), thus f(f(f(x))) = f(a). - Let b = f(a), so a = f(b). Hence, both (a, b) and (b, a) must lie on y = f(x). - This transformation shows the symmetry and intersections of the function f(x) with itself when transformed. 3. Count the solutions: - We have points in the interval where f(x) = 0 gives 5 solutions. - For each nonzero value of y, each corresponding x = f(y) results in four solutions. - We find the intersection points of y = f(x) and x = f(f(y)) within the interval. Assume there are k intersection points, then with each having 4 solutions, we get 4k + 5. Calculating the precise number of intersections analytically is complex without more visual or computational aid. However, given the increased interval and periodicity, assume symmetry and additional intersections compared to the original problem. Conclusion: Assuming a similar structure and considering the extended interval, if the original problem had 61 solutions, this new setup is likely to have more due to a larger interval and similar periodic intersections.

Define x' as the number of members voting for the bill in the re-vote, and y' as the number voting against. Then: [ x' - y' = 2m ] [ x' + y' = 500 ] It's given that x' = frac{10}{9}y. Hence: [ frac{10}{9}y + y' = 500 ] [ y' = 500 - frac{10}{9}y ] Substituting into x' - y' = 2m: [ frac{10}{9}y - (500 - frac{10}{9}y) = 2m ] [ frac{20}{9}y - 500 = 2m ] From y - x = m, we have m = y - x = y - (500 - y) = 2y - 500.

Assume y = 282 (rounded), then x = 500 - 282 = 218, and x' = frac{10}{9} times 282 = 313.33 roughly rounds to 313. The increase in votes for the bill is: [ x' - x = 313 - 218 = 95 ] Conclusion: The new problem had a valid solution with the members changing their votes by 95 from the initial to the re-vote.

Each element is either: - The sum of two adjacent elements from the previous row - The elements on the first and last positions which are ( a + nd ) - This formulation ensures that each element in the (n+1)-th row can be derived using the arithmetic sum property and the previous row's elements. - Let ( S_n ) denote the sum of the n-th row. - The (n+1)-th row has elements such that: [ S_{n+1} = 2S_n + 2d ] 4. **Verification with Initial Condition:** - The formula 2S_n + 2d implies the following sequence: [ S_2 = 2 cdot 2a + 2d = 4a + 2d ] 5. **Inductive Conclusion:** - If S_n = 2^n a + (2^n - 2)d, substituting this in and using the relation ( S_{n+1} = 2S_n + 2d ): [ S_{n+1} = 2(2^n a + (2^n - 2)d) + 2d = 2^{n+1} a + (2 cdot 2^n - 4 + 2)d = 2^{n+1} a + (2^{n+1} - 2)d ] - Therefore, by induction: [ S_n = 2^n a + (2^n - 2)d ] - This completes the inductive proof.

Therefore, B text{ is guilty}. 2. **From statement 2**: - Statement 2: V rightarrow (neg A land neg B) Given that we have already determined that B is guilty, the statement V rightarrow (neg A land neg B) must be false, because the right-hand side (neg A land neg B) contains a falsehood since B is guilty. Therefore, V cannot be guilty. Hence, V is not guilty. 3. **From statement 4**: - Statement 4: B rightarrow (A vee V) We know B is guilty. Therefore, for this implication to hold, either A or V should be guilty. Since V is not guilty (from step 2), A must be guilty. Consequently, A is guilty. 4. **Finally, consider statement 1 again**: - If G is not guilty, then (B land neg A) must hold. Since we determined A is guilty, this statement must not hold, meaning the assumption that G is not guilty leads to a contradiction. Hence, G must be guilty.

Two ways are considered distinct if they require cutting the square in different locations. In particular, rotations and reflections are considered distinct. 1. **Identify Possible Shapes** Note that the allowable shapes with interior angles either (45^circ) or (90^circ) degrees are limited to right isosceles triangles and certain types of rectangles. 2. **Case 1: Small Right Isosceles Triangles** - Each ( frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} ) square can be divided into two right isosceles triangles. - The entire ( 1 times 1 ) square can be divided into (4) such (frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} ) squares, resulting in 8 triangles. - Each of the 4 small squares ((4) quadrants) has two ways to place the diagonal dividing it into triangles: the diagonal could go from top-left to bottom-right or from top-right to bottom-left. - Therefore, the total number of ways for this configuration is [ 2^4 = 16 ] 3. **Case 2: Rectangles of Width (frac{1}{8})** - Rectangles of width (frac{1}{8}) and length 1 perfectly fit (8) times along one dimension. - They can either be arranged vertically or horizontally. - Thus, there are [ 2 ] ways in this case. 4. **Case 3: Rectangles of Width (frac{1}{4}) and Height (frac{1}{2})** - Divide the (1 times 1) square into (4) quadrants of (frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2}). Each quadrant can contain two (frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{2}) rectangles. - We need to consider several sub-cases based on how these rectangles span across the quadrants: - **Within each quadrant:** Each quadrant can be divided independently into 2 rectangles in (2^4 = 16) ways. - **Spanning adjacent quadrants:** Let's label the quadrants as (A, B, C, D). Rectangles can span: - (A, B) ((4) ways) - (B, C) ((4) ways) - (C, D) ((4) ways) - (D, A) ((4) ways) - **Spanning 2 pairs of quadrants:** - Rectangles spanning (A, B) and (C, D) ((1) way) - Rectangles spanning (B, C) and (D, A) ((1) way) - There are also distinct ways for each pair of adjacent quadrants: - (2) ways for each pairing. - Totaling all the possibilities: [ 16 (individual quadrants) + 4 (A, B) + 4 (B, C) + 4 (C, D) + 4 (D, A) + 1 (A, B and C, D) + 1 (B, C and D, A) + 2 = 36 ] 5. **Summing All Cases** - The total number of ways to cut the square into the specified pieces is: [ 16 (text{small triangles}) + 2 (text{thin rectangles}) + 36 (text{larger rectangles}) = 54 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{54} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = x + bcos x, where b is a constant.

This is because the midpoint of ( BC ) should lie on this circle. 3. **Construct the Circle Diameter**: - Construct another circle with diameter ( AX ). Here, ( AX ) is drawn such that ( X ) is the midpoint of ( MB ). 4. **Intersection of Circles**: - Check the intersection points of the two circles: - If the two circles do not intersect, the condition ( BC < frac{AB}{2} ) or ( BC > AB ) holds, making it impossible to form the triangle. - If the circles intersect at point ( N ), proceed to the next step. 5. **Determine Point C**: - Let ( N ) be the midpoint of ( BC ).

We need to find the length of (HC) given that (AC = 2). 2. **Parallel Lines Identification:** Since both (angle CHD) and (angle HDK) are right angles, line (KD) must be parallel to line (AC) (as they are both perpendicular to line (DH)). This information will help us with congruence relations. 3. **Identifying Congruent Angles:** - Angles (angle HAD) and (angle ADK) are equal because they are alternate interior angles created by the parallel lines (AC) and (KD) with the transversal (AD). - Similarly, angles (angle DCA) and (angle BDK) are corresponding angles and thus are equal. 4. **Isosceles Triangle Identification:** Given that (DK) is the angle bisector of (triangle BDA), it follows that (angle DKA = angle DAK). When combined with the earlier analysis, this tells us that angles (angle DAC = angle DCA), indicating that (triangle ADC) is isosceles with (AD = DC). 5. **Altitude and Median Property:** From the property of isosceles triangles, the altitude (DH) from the vertex (D) to the base (AC) also serves as the median.

Taking the square root of both sides and noting that a^{frac{1}{2}} + a^{-frac{1}{2}} > 0, we obtain a^{frac{1}{2}} + a^{-frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{6}. Therefore, boxed{a^{frac{1}{2}} + a^{-frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{6}}. 2. First, note that log_{10} x + log_{10} y = log_{10} xy. So, the given equation implies that 2log_{10} frac{x-y}{2} = log_{10} xy, which leads to (frac{x-y}{2})^2 = xy. Expanding and simplifying this equation gives frac{y}{x} + frac{x}{y} = 6. Solving for frac{x}{y}, we find that frac{x}{y} = 3 + 2sqrt{2} or frac{x}{y} = 3 - 2sqrt{2} (the latter solution is discarded since x and y must have the same sign).

Notice that the radius of the inscribed circle omega is 6, and its center is at O. The circle omega is tangent to the sides CM and FM at points P and K respectively. 2.

Therefore, the line segment (OM) can be considered as the diameter of the circumcircle Omega of the triangle PKM. 4. Given the radius of the circumcircle Omega is (frac{5 sqrt{13}}{2}), the diameter (OM) is twice the radius. Hence, we have: [ OM = 2 times frac{5 sqrt{13}}{2} = 5 sqrt{13} ] Thus, the length of (OM) is: [ boxed{OM = 5 sqrt{13}} ] **Part (b)**: Find the length of the bisector (MA) of triangle CFM and its area (S). 1.

Since the ratio of the areas of triangles CFT and CFM is frac{5}{8}, the ratio of their corresponding altitudes (TA:MA) must also be frac{5}{8}. Hence we set up: [ frac{5}{8} = frac{TA}{MA} = frac{MA - MT}{MA} ] Solving for (MA): [ 5MA = 8MA - 8MT implies 3MA = 8MT implies MA = frac{8}{3} MT = frac{8}{3} times frac{5sqrt{13}}{2} = frac{20sqrt{13}}{3} ] Therefore: [ boxed{MA = frac{20 sqrt{13}}{3}} ] 5.

The combined speed of the two boats heading towards each other is 4 miles/hr + 20 miles/hr = 24 miles/hr. Since they start 20 miles apart, the time it takes for them to meet is the distance divided by their combined speed: Time = Distance / Speed = 20 miles / 24 miles/hr = 5/6 hours. Now, let's convert this time to minutes: 5/6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 50 minutes. So, without considering the third boat and the ocean current, the first two boats will meet in 50 minutes. However, we need to find the distance between the first two boats one minute before they meet. Since they are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 24 miles/hr, in one minute (which is 1/60 of an hour), they will cover: Distance covered in 1 minute = 24 miles/hr * (1/60) hours = 0.4 miles.

The third boat's speed varies between 2 miles/hr and 5 miles/hr, and the ocean current can affect the speed by ±1 mile/hr. However, since we are looking for the distance one minute before all three boats meet, the varying speed of the third boat and the ocean current's influence do not affect the distance between the first two boats one minute before they meet. The third boat and the ocean current will only affect the time it takes for all three boats to meet at the same point, not the distance between the first two boats one minute before they meet.

There is only one King of Spades in the deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing it first is: P(King of Spades) = 1/52 Next, we need to find the probability of drawing the 10 of Hearts after the King of Spades has been drawn.

To convert the time to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 30 minutes = 30/60 hours = 0.5 hours The distance covered by the train from A to point C is: Distance_A_to_C = Speed_A * Time = 50 km/h * 0.5 h = 25 km Now, let's find the distance covered by the train from B to point C. We know that the total distance covered by both trains is 120 km, and they meet at point C, so the distance covered by the train from B to point C is the remainder of the total distance after subtracting the distance covered by the train from A: Distance_B_to_C = Total_Distance - Distance_A_to_C = 120 km - 25 km = 95 km The train from A continues to travel for another 30 minutes after reaching point C.

Given a triangle (ABC) where side (AB = c) is known, and the sum of the other two sides (BC + CA = a + b = s) is given, along with the circumradius (r). 2. Start by drawing a circle (k) with radius (r) and center (O). Choose an arbitrary point (A) on the circle to be one of the vertices of the triangle. 3. Draw a point (B) on the circle such that (AB = c). We need to find the position of the third vertex (C). 4. Assume the triangle has been constructed. Reflect point (B) about the line extending (AC) to obtain point (B^*) such that (AB^* = AC + CB = s). Here, (angle ACB = gamma), which is the exterior angle at (C). This angle is related to the central angle (angle AOB) subtended by arc (AB) since (angle ACB = frac{1}{2}angle AOB). 5. Hence, the triangle (CBB^*) is isosceles with (angle CBB^* = frac{gamma}{2} = frac{1}{4}angle AOB). 6. Now, point (B^*) lies on: - The circle (k^*) with center (A) and radius (s). - The arc of a circle which subtends an angle of (frac{gamma}{2}) on line (AB). 7. The intersection of circle (k^*) and the arc defines point (B^*). The line joining (A) to (B^*) when extended will intersect the circle (k) at a point (C). This (C) is the third vertex of the triangle. 8. To execute: - Construct the arc with center (A) and radius (s). - Construct the angle arc with a vertex at (A) and the angle (frac{gamma}{2}). 9. Verify the triangle: - The vertices (A, B, C) must lie on a circle with radius (r). - Verify that the side (AB = c). - Check (CBB^*) is isosceles where (CB + CA = s). This ensures that the triangle (ABC) meets all given conditions. 10. Discussion: - If (c > 2r), the construction is impossible since (AB = c) is too large compared to the diameter (2r). - If (c = 2r), only one construction is possible as (AB) will be the diameter of the circle, and (C)'s chord would be perpendicular to (AB). - When (c < 2r), this setup results in two potential solutions based on which arc the construction follows. - Additional verification involves placing points on specific arcs and reflecting across lines, ensuring a thorough check of all geometrical constraints. 11. Conclusion: This construction problem illustrates classic geometric methods by breaking the problem into analysis, construction, verification, and discussion, ensuring every conceivable case for the data set (a + b, c, r) is considered.

The ratio of their profits is given as 7 : 14 : 9. Let's denote the profits of partners p, q, and r as Profit_p, Profit_q, and Profit_r respectively. So we can write: Profit_p : Profit_q : Profit_r = 7 : 14 : 9 Since profit is proportional to the product of money invested and time, we can write the following equations based on the given ratios: Profit_p / Profit_q = (P * Tp) / (Q * Tq) Profit_q / Profit_r = (Q * Tq) / (R * Tr) From the given profit ratio, we have: Profit_p / Profit_q = 7 / 14 = 1 / 2 Profit_q / Profit_r = 14 / 9 Now, let's substitute the values of P, Q, and R from the investment ratio: (7 * Tp) / (5 * Tq) = 1 / 2 (5 * Tq) / (3 * Tr) = 14 / 9 From the first equation: 7 * Tp = 1/2 * 5 * Tq 7 * 5 = 1/2 * 5 * Tq 35 = 1/2 * 5 * Tq 35 = 2.5 * Tq Tq = 35 / 2.5 Tq = 14 months So, partner q invested the money for boxed{14} months."},{"instruction":"f during a chess tournament, each participant plays exactly one game with each of the remaining participants, and a total of 378 games are played, find the minimum and maximum possible number of participants.","output":"Let's denote the number of participants as n. In a tournament where each participant plays exactly one game with each of the other participants, the total number of games played can be calculated using the formula for combinations: Total games = nC2 = n! / (2!(n-2)!) This is because each game is a unique combination of two players from the n participants. Simplifying the formula, we get: Total games = n(n-1)/2 We are given that the total number of games played is 378, so we can set up the equation: n(n-1)/2 = 378 Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: n(n-1) = 756 Now we need to find the integer value of n that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trial and error or by factoring 756 to find its pair factors. 756 = 1 * 756 756 = 2 * 378 756 = 3 * 252 756 = 4 * 189 756 = 6 * 126 756 = 7 * 108 756 = 9 * 84 756 = 12 * 63 756 = 14 * 54 756 = 18 * 42 756 = 21 * 36 756 = 27 * 28 We are looking for a pair of factors that are consecutive numbers because n and n-1 are consecutive.

Prove that regardless of the real value of m, the line l always intersects with the circle C at two points. 2. Find the equation of the line l when the chord it cuts off from the circle C is the shortest.","output":"1. To prove that the line l intersects with the circle C at two points for any real m, we can show that the discriminant of the system of equations represented by l and C is always positive. The equation of the circle can be rewritten as x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = 25, which simplifies to x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 20 = 0. Substituting the expression for y from the line equation, we can solve the system to find the points of intersection. From the line equation (2m+1)x + (m+1)y - 7m - 4 = 0, we can express y in terms of x: y = frac{7m + 4 - (2m+1)x}{m+1}. Substituting into the circle's equation: x^2 - 2x + left(frac{7m + 4 - (2m+1)x}{m+1}right)^2 - 4left(frac{7m + 4 - (2m+1)x}{m+1}right) - 20 = 0. Now, we need to determine the discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation in x. After simplifying the quadratic equation, if Delta > 0, it proves that there are two distinct real roots, thus two points of intersection. Without fully expanding the expression, it's clear that Delta is dependent on m^2 and m terms, which will always be positive, ensuring that Delta > 0. Hence, line l always intersects circle C at two points regardless of the value of m. 2. The chord length will be shortest when the line l is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of intersection, which means the line passing through this point and the center of the circle (1, 2) is perpendicular to line l. The slope of the radius is given by frac{y - 2}{x - 1}. Since the line l is perpendicular to the radius, its slope will be the negative reciprocal. Therefore, if the slope of the line l is -frac{1}{k} where k is the slope of the radius, we have: -frac{1}{k} = -frac{x - 1}{y - 2}. Then, x - 1 = k(y - 2). For k to be the slope of the radius (and thus the slope of line l to be its negative reciprocal), k must equal frac{1}{1-m} for it to fulfill the relationship with m established by the line equation (2m+1)x + (m+1)y - 7m - 4 = 0. Hence, we seek to have k=frac{2m+1}{m+1}. Setting the two expressions for k equal to each other, we get: frac{1}{1-m} = frac{2m+1}{m+1}. Solving this equation for m we obtain: m + 1 = (1 - m)(2m + 1), m + 1 = -2m^2 + m + 1, 2m^2 = 0, m = 0. If m = 0, the equation of line l becomes: l: (2 cdot 0 + 1)x + (0 + 1)y - 7 cdot 0 - 4 = 0, l: x + y - 4 = 0. However, this line does not give the shortest chord length. Instead, we need to ensure the line is perpendicular to the radius by setting k = 1, giving us the slope of a perpendicular line as -1. Thus, the correct equation should be: l: 2x - y - 5 = 0. And so, the shortest chord will be cut by the line with the equation boxed{2x - y - 5 = 0}."},{"instruction":"Simplify overrightarrow {AB}+ overrightarrow {BD} overrightarrow {AC} overrightarrow {CD} = ( ) A: overrightarrow {AD} B: overrightarrow {0} C: overrightarrow {BC} D: overrightarrow {DA}","output":"Solution: Since overrightarrow {AB}+ overrightarrow {BD}- overrightarrow {AC}- overrightarrow {CD}=( overrightarrow {AB}+ overrightarrow {BD})-( overrightarrow {AC}+ overrightarrow {CD})= overrightarrow {AD}- overrightarrow {AD}= overrightarrow {0}． Therefore, the correct option is B.

The flagstaff and its shadow form a right-angled triangle, as do the building and its shadow. Since the conditions are similar for both the flagstaff and the building, the ratios of their corresponding sides (height to shadow length) will be equal. Let's denote the length of the shadow cast by the building as ( S ).

How many sacks does the first bakery need per week?","output":"Let's denote the number of sacks the first bakery needs per week as x. According to the problem, the total number of sacks needed by all the bakeries in 4 weeks is 72. We also know that the second bakery needs 4 sacks per week and the third bakery needs 12 sacks per week. So, the total number of sacks needed by the second bakery in 4 weeks is 4 sacks/week * 4 weeks = 16 sacks. The total number of sacks needed by the third bakery in 4 weeks is 12 sacks/week * 4 weeks = 48 sacks. Now, we can set up an equation for the total number of sacks needed by all the bakeries in 4 weeks: 4x (for the first bakery) + 16 (for the second bakery) + 48 (for the third bakery) = 72 4x + 16 + 48 = 72 Combine the constants: 4x + 64 = 72 Subtract 64 from both sides: 4x = 72 - 64 4x = 8 Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x: x = 8 / 4 x = 2 Therefore, the first bakery needs boxed{2} sacks per week."},{"instruction":"On the computer screen, there is a number 12.

Let's subtract 1000 from 345564 and see if there's another multiple of 4213 within that range: 345564 - 1000 = 344564 Now, let's divide 344564 by 4213 to see if there's another multiple close by: 344564 / 4213 ≈ 81.78 Since 81.78 is not a whole number, the closest lower multiple of 4213 would be given by 4213 * 81, which is: 4213 * 81 = 341253 Now, let's find the difference between 345564 and 341253: 345564 - 341253 = 4311 Since 4311 is greater than 1000, it is not a valid value for n (as n must be less than 1000).

Substitute ( x = y + 2 ): [ lim_{x to 2} e^{frac{3x+2}{x-2} lnleft(2e^{x-2} - 1right)} = lim_{y to 0} e^{frac{3(y+2) + 2}{y} lnleft(2e^y - 1right)} ] 3. **Simplify the Exponent:** [ lim_{y to 0} e^{frac{3y + 8}{y} lnleft(2e^y - 1right)} ] 4. **Simplifying the Logarithm:** As ( y to 0 ), [ 2e^y - 1 approx 2 (1 + y - 1) = 2y ] This leads us to the asymptotic equivalence: [ lnleft(2e^y - 1right) approx ln (2y) ] As ( y to 0 ), [ 2 (e^y - 1) sim 2y quad text{because} quad e^y - 1 approx y text{ for } y to 0. ] 5. **Substitute and Simplify Further:** [ lim_{y to 0} e^{frac{3y + 8}{y} cdot 2y} ] Since ( 2 ln (2y) sim 2y ), [ frac{3y + 8}{y} cdot 2y = 2 (3y + 8) ] 6. **Compute the Final Limit:** [ lim_{y to 0} e^{2(3y + 8)} = e^{2 cdot 8} = e^{16} ] # Conclusion: The limit of the given function is: [ boxed{e^{16}} ]"},{"instruction":"de a regular hexagon with side length 1, there are 7 points. Prove that among them, there exist two points at a distance of no more than 1.","output":"We need to prove that among the 7 points located inside a regular hexagon with side length 1, there exist at least two points that are no further than 1 unit apart. 1. **Divide the Hexagon**: We start by dividing the regular hexagon into 6 smaller, congruent equilateral triangles. Each of these triangles has a side length of 1. Since the regular hexagon can be perfectly divided into 6 equilateral triangles, the side length of each triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle**: We now apply the pigeonhole principle, a fundamental principle in combinatorics. The principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In our specific situation: - We have 7 points (items). - These points are to be placed inside the 6 equilateral triangles (containers). According to the pigeonhole principle, since we have more points (7) than triangles (6), at least one of these equilateral triangles must contain at least 2 points. 3. **Distance Within an Equilateral Triangle**: - In an equilateral triangle with side length 1, any two points within this triangle must be at most 1 unit apart. This is because the greatest possible distance between any two points in an equilateral triangle with side length 1 is the length of the side itself, which is 1. 4. **Conclusion**: Hence, there must be at least two points located within the same equilateral triangle, and the distance between these two points cannot be more than 1 unit. 5. **Final Proof**: This confirms that among the 7 points within the regular hexagon, there are at least two points whose distance from each other is no greater than 1 unit.
