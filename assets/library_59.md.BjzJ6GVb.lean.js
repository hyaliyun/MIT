En niños, esta condición a menudo se corrige de manera natural con el crecimiento, pero en adultos puede requerir intervención. Los ejercicios dirigidos pueden ayudar a mejorar la alineación y fortalecer los músculos que soportan las rodillas. Aquí te presentamos algunos ejercicios y consejos que pueden contribuir a la corrección del genu valgum. Sin embargo, es importante que consultes a un fisioterapeuta o a un profesional de la salud antes de iniciar cualquier programa de ejercicios, ya que pueden proporcionarte una rutina adaptada a tus necesidades específicas. 1. **Fortalecimiento de los músculos abductores de cadera**: Estos son los músculos que ayudan a mover la pierna hacia afuera, lejos del cuerpo. El ejercicios como \\"monster walks\\" o caminatas laterales con bandas de resistencia son útiles para fortalecer estos músculos. 2. **Ejercicios de estabilización de rodilla**: Los ejercicios que trabajan el vasto medial oblicuo, un componente del cuádriceps que ayuda a alinear la rótula y la rodilla, como las contracciones estáticas o los mini-squats manteniendo la rodilla alineada con los pies, pueden ser beneficiosos. 3. **Estiramiento de los músculos aductores**: Los aductores son los músculos que tiran de las piernas hacia el centro del cuerpo y a menudo se acortan con el genu valgum. Estirarlos puede ayudar a mejorar la alineación de las piernas. 4. **Ejercicios de control motor**: La mejora del control motor y la propiocepción puede ser beneficiosa para alinear la pierna durante las actividades diarias y deportivas. Ejercicios como equilibrios en una pierna, giros controlados y ejercicios pliométricos pueden ser incorporados bajo supervisión profesional. 5. **Fortalecimiento general de piernas**: Ejercicios que fortalecen los músculos generales de las piernas, incluidos los cuádriceps, isquiotibiales y pantorrillas, como sentadillas, estocadas, y levantamientos de pantorrillas. 6. **Entrenamiento de la marcha y la postura**: A veces, se requiere la corrección de la mecánica del caminar y la postura general para cambiar los patrones de movimiento que pueden estar contribuyendo al problema. 7. **Estabilización de la columna**: Fortalecer los músculos alrededor de la columna y trabajar en la estabilidad del tronco pueden ayudar a mejorar la postura general y la alineación, lo cual puede tener un efecto positivo en la alineación de las piernas. Es importante recordar que la efectividad de los ejercicios en la corrección del genu valgum puede variar mucho entre individuos y dependiendo de la severidad de la condición. En casos moderados a severos, puede ser necesaria la intervención quirúrgica. Además, el uso de plantillas ortopédicas o aparatos ortopédicos también puede ser recomendado por un profesional. Siempre es recomendable buscar la orientación de un profesional de la salud, como un fisioterapeuta, para obtener un diagnóstico adecuado y un plan de tratamiento personalizado. Estos profesionales pueden ayudarte a realizar los ejercicios de manera correcta y efectiva y modificarlos según sea necesario para prevenir el riesgo de lesiones o empeoramiento de la condición."},{"instruction":"Ya, pero que ejercicios","output":"Entiendo, estás buscando ejemplos específicos de ejercicios que puedan ayudar a corregir el genu valgum. A continuación, te describo algunos ejercicios que suelen recomendarse para fortalecer y estabilizar los músculos que podrían ayudar a mejorar esta condición. Recuerda que es importante realizar estos ejercicios bajo la supervisión de un profesional si es posible, para asegurarte de que estás realizándolos correctamente y de manera segura. 1. **Abducciones de cadera con bandas elásticas**: Ponte una banda elástica alrededor de tus tobillos y párate con los pies separados al ancho de los hombros. Mantén uno de tus pies fijo en el suelo y mueve el otro hacia el lado, alejándolo del centro de tu cuerpo. Hazlo de manera controlada y vuelve a la posición inicial. 2. **Sentadillas isométricas con pelota**: Coloca una pelota de pilates o similar entre tus rodillas y realiza una sentadilla. Al descender, aprieta la pelota entre las rodillas para activar los músculos internos del muslo. Mantén la posición por unos segundos y luego vuelve a subir. 3. **Puente de glúteos con pelota**: Acuéstate boca arriba, con las rodillas dobladas y los pies planos en el suelo. Coloca una pelota de pilates entre tus rodillas y luego eleva la cadera del suelo apretando los glúteos, al mismo tiempo que presionas la pelota con las rodillas. Mantén la posición durante un momento y luego baja lentamente. 4. **Estocadas laterales**: Realiza una estocada lateral asegurándote de que la rodilla de la pierna que se mueve hacia el lado se mantenga alineada con el pie y no se desplace hacia adentro, lo que puede ayudar a fortalecer adecuadamente los músculos estabilizadores de la rodilla. 5. **Estiramientos de aductores**: Siéntate en el suelo con las plantas de los pies juntas y las rodillas caídas hacia los lados. Usa los codos para empujar suavemente las rodillas hacia abajo, sintiendo un estiramiento en la parte interna de los muslos. 6. **Deslizamientos de pared con estabilidad de rodilla**: Con la espalda contra la pared, baja en una sentadilla como si estuvieras sentándote en una silla, asegurándote de que tus rodillas no se inclinen hacia adentro. Puedes utilizar una banda elástica alrededor de las rodillas para proporcionar resistencia. Estos ejercicios están destinados a mejorar la fuerza y estabilidad de la musculatura alrededor de las caderas y rodillas, lo que podría contribuir a una mejor alineación de las rodillas. Sin embargo, deben realizarse con precaución y preferiblemente bajo la supervisión de un fisioterapeuta, especialmente si sientes dolor o incomodidad al realizarlos."},{"instruction":"¿Y estando de cuclillas mucho tiempo si soy adulto mejorará mi genus valgus?","output":"Mantenerse en cuclillas (squat) durante períodos prolongados no es una solución recomendada para corregir el genu valgum (rodillas en X) y podría no ser efectivo o seguro para tratar esta condición, especialmente en adultos. Es importante entender que el genu valgum puede ser resultado de varios factores, incluidos patrones de movimiento inadecuados, debilidades musculares y desequilibrios estructurales, y no hay una solución única para todos. Hacer squats puede ser beneficioso como parte de un programa de fortalecimiento general cuando se realizan correctamente y de forma controlada, pero hacerlo por tiempo prolongado o sin la técnica adecuada puede poner estrés indebido en las rodillas y otras articulaciones. Para abordar el genu valgum mediante ejercicios, es más efectivo realizar un programa de ejercicios específicos que estén diseñados para fortalecer los músculos que pueden ayudar a mejorar la alineación de las piernas y estabilizar las rodillas. Estos ejercicios pueden incluir: - Fortalecimiento de los abductores de cadera. - Estiramientos de los aductores. - Ejercicios de estabilización y equilibrio. - Entrenamiento de la marcha y la postura. La cuclilla o squat por sí sola, especialmente si se mantiene por un largo tiempo, no corrige automáticamente la alineación de las rodillas y, de hecho, sin la supervisión adecuada, podría exacerbar problemas preexistentes. Si consideras que el genu valgum está afectando tu calidad de vida, la mejor opción es consultar a un profesional médico, como un fisioterapeuta o un ortopedista. Ellos pueden evaluar tu situación particular y, si es apropiado, diseñarán un programa de entrenamiento personalizado y controlado con ejercicios específicos para ayudar a corregir el problema. Además, te pueden aconsejar sobre las modificaciones necesarias en tus actividades diarias y tu rutina de ejercicios para evitar empeorar la condición."},{"instruction":"Como se llama la posición para orar donde juntas ambas palmas de las manos y lo pone delante de tu cara, las palmas y los dedos quedan pegadas uno de la otra","output":"La posición que describes para orar, donde se juntan ambas palmas y dedos pegados uno frente al otro delante de la cara, es comúnmente conocida como \\"Anjali Mudra\\" en el contexto del yoga o prácticas hindúes y budistas. En tales tradiciones, esta postura de las manos es un gesto de reverencia y respeto. Además, en la cultura occidental y en el cristianismo, este gesto a menudo se asocia con la oración y se conoce simplemente como posición de oración o actitud de oración.

Фильм “RUN ZOMBIE, RUN” показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it.

ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed.

Her hands never waver, her eyes never stray. The readouts wink back at her with promising data, and the compound finally takes form—a vial shining with the hope of humanity. MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission.

He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds.

The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter.

ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE – DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

MARIA (her voice lilting, playful) Just another day at the office for the Kaynes duo. Their car pulls into the driveway, the engine purring to a halt. The night’s embrace cocoons them, a momentary pause in the relentless march of their lives. ED (softly, as they sit in the car) This is it, our leap into the unknown. Our work—our love—could change everything. MARIA reaches out, her hand finding ED’s in the darkness. A silent connection that speaks louder than words—a promise of unity against the shadows they’ve cast. MARIA (squeezing his hand, earnestly) No matter what tomorrow brings, we face it together, Ed. Side by side, come what may. The LIGHTS from their house beckon, a warm glow against the dark, an anchor amidst the storm of change they’ve set in motion.

Their glasses CLINK, an ACCORD struck not just to their UNION but to the paradigms they dare to shift. ED (with a rare earnestness) Against the vastness of TIME, it’s US, together. Locked in step against the depths of the UNKNOWN. Their embrace is the EPICENTER of the room. Any DISTRACTIONS, the awards, the accolades, recede into insignificance against their shared moment.

However, when her younger self and younger version of her uncle are wrenched from the past due to a magical misstep (disaster), she’s thrust into a battle against her past mistakes (passivity and short-sightedness) and an impending civil war (conflict), challenging her to overcome personal flaws and rival political forces (opponent) to safeguard her children’s and the realm’s future. </premise> <thematic argument> In order to survive and secure their family’s future in the game of thrones, one must actively engage and confront their rival factions. </thematic argument> <setting> i. The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. ii. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. iii. The timeline is changed, here it is the year 134 AC. iv. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. v. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. vi. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. vii. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand. viii. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. ix. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. x. The greens, originally known as the queen\'s party, are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. xi. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. xii. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just discuss the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. xiii. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. xiv. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. xv. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or decisions in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. xvi. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals\' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power.

Through each chapter, characters must undergo development that ties into the overarching theme and the Midpoint shift where Rhaenyra transitions from passive to active. Here\'s the outline: **Chapters 11-13: Rising Action Toward the Midpoint** - Chapter 11: - Scene 11.1: Rhaenyra and Nyra have a lengthy, honest conversation. Rhaenyra imparts some wisdom regarding the complexities of ruling and reveals her regrets about her affair. Nyra listens but is resolute about changing her future, specifically avoiding having children seen as bastards. - EO: Nyra escapes the castle using stealth, intending to find Daemion and elope before she\'s forced back to her time. - Chapter 12: - Scene 12.1: Damien, filled with anger towards Rhaenyra’s refusal, enlists the help of a local hedge mage to cast a counter-spell that will ensure Nyra remains in the present, thus enabling them to marry. - EO: Daemon catches wind of Daemion’s intentions and tries to stop him to preserve his daughters. - Chapter 13 (Midpoint): - Scene 13.1: Rhaenyra learns from Gaerra about the dire future and decides to seize control actively.

Teacher-Student Framework: In this approach, a pre-trained larger model (the teacher) is used to generate soft targets (probability distributions over classes and bounding box regressions) for a smaller model (the student). The student model is then trained to mimic the outputs of the teacher model. This approach can help in transferring the knowledge from the more accurate teacher model to the smaller student model. 2. Multi-Step Knowledge Distillation: Instead of directly training the student model to mimic the outputs of the teacher model, this approach involves training the student model in multiple steps. In the first step, the student model is trained to match the intermediate representations (feature maps) of the teacher model. In the subsequent steps, the student model is further fine-tuned using the knowledge from the teacher model, gradually refining the predictions. 3. Attention Transfer: This approach focuses on transferring the attention maps learned by the teacher model to the student model. The attention maps indicate the regions of the input image that are considered important for object detection. By training the student model to mimic the attention maps of the teacher model, it can learn to attend to similar informative regions in the image. 4. Intermediate-Level Supervision: In this approach, the teacher model is used to provide supervisory signals at intermediate levels of the student model. Instead of directly training the student model with ground truth annotations, it is trained to match the intermediate predictions of the teacher model. This can help in capturing more fine-grained information and better localizing objects. These approaches aim to improve object detection performance by leveraging the knowledge from a teacher model, which is typically larger and more accurate. By distilling this knowledge into a smaller student model, it is possible to achieve comparable or even better performance with reduced computational requirements."},{"instruction":"Explain feature-based, relation-based and response-based knowledge distillation for object detection","output":"Feature-based, relation-based, and response-based knowledge distillation are three different approaches for distilling knowledge from a teacher model to a student model in the context of object detection. 1. Feature-based Knowledge Distillation: In feature-based distillation, the focus is on transferring knowledge from the intermediate feature maps of the teacher model to the student model. The teacher model\'s feature maps encode rich representations of the input image, capturing both low-level and high-level information about objects. The student model is trained to mimic these feature maps by minimizing the feature-level differences between the teacher and student predictions. By transferring such knowledge, the student model can better understand the semantic and spatial relationships between objects in the image, leading to improved object detection performance. 2. Relation-based Knowledge Distillation: Relation-based distillation aims to transfer the knowledge about object interactions and relationships that the teacher model has learned. The teacher model can capture contextual information, such as the relative positions and interactions between objects, which can be crucial for accurate object detection. To distill such knowledge, the student model is trained to predict the object relations using the teacher model as a reference. This involves learning to estimate object distances, angles, or relative positions. By incorporating this relational knowledge, the student model can make more informed predictions about object locations and boundaries. 3. Response-based Knowledge Distillation: Response-based distillation focuses on transferring knowledge about how the teacher model responds to different inputs and classifies objects. The responses of the teacher model can include both class probabilities and bounding box regressions. The student model is trained to mimic the teacher\'s responses by minimizing the differences between their predictions. This approach helps the student model learn from the teacher\'s expertise in distinguishing various object classes and localizing objects accurately. The distilled knowledge can also improve the student model\'s ability to handle challenging cases or rare object categories that the teacher model is well-trained on. Overall, these approaches provide different ways to transfer knowledge from a teacher model to a student model in the domain of object detection. By leveraging the teacher\'s expertise in terms of feature representations, object relations, and response patterns, the student model can benefit from this distilled knowledge and achieve better object detection performance."},{"instruction":"Explain the research paper named: Localization Distillation for Dense Object Detection","output":"The research paper titled \\"Localization Distillation for Dense Object Detection\\" proposes a novel approach called Localization Distillation (LD) for improving dense object detection in computer vision tasks. The paper was authored by Yihui He, Chenchen Zhu, Jianren Wang, Marios Savvides, and Xiangyu Zhang. It was published at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in 2020. The objective of the paper is to address the challenge of accurately localizing objects in dense scenarios, where objects are densely packed or overlapping. Traditional object detectors often struggle in such scenarios, as they may fail to precisely localize objects when they are close to each other. The Localization Distillation approach presented in the paper tackles this problem by introducing a new loss function called Localization Distillation Loss (L2o). This loss function is designed to distill the knowledge of precise object localization from a teacher model to a student model during training. The key idea behind Localization Distillation is as follows: given an input image, the teacher model generates dense and accurate object proposals. These proposals are treated as pseudo ground truth during training, where the student model is trained to predict similar object localization results as the teacher. This distillation process helps the student model in learning to overcome the challenge of densely packed objects and improve its ability to localize objects accurately. In addition to the L2o loss function, the paper also introduces a parallel learning strategy that enables the teacher and student models to learn collaboratively. The teacher model guides the student model not only through the loss function but also by refining the object proposals generated during the distillation process. This parallel learning mechanism further enhances the student model\'s localization capabilities. The authors highlight the effectiveness of their proposed Localization Distillation method through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and Cityscapes. The results demonstrate that the student model trained with Localization Distillation consistently outperforms state-of-the-art object detectors, with significant improvements in terms of localization accuracy, especially in dense object scenarios. In conclusion, the paper \\"Localization Distillation for Dense Object Detection\\" introduces a novel approach that addresses the challenge of accurately localizing densely packed objects.

Instead of distilling the hybrid knowledge on feature maps, we present a novel divide-and-conquer distillation strategy that separately distills the semantic and localization knowledge based on their respective preferred regions. To transfer the semantic knowledge, we simply adopt the classification KD [20] on the classification head while for localization knowledge, we propose a simple yet effective localization distillation (LD). Both techniques operate on the logits of individual heads rather than deep features. Then, to further improve the distillation efficiency, we introduce valuable localization region (VLR) that can help judge which type of knowledge is conducive to transfer for different regions. In what follows, we first briefly revisit the probability distribution representation of bounding box and then transit to the proposed method. 3.1. Preliminaries For a given bounding box B, conventional representations have two forms, i.e., {x, y, w, h} (central point coordinates, width and height) [33, 41, 44] and {t, b, l, r} (distance from the sampling point to the top, bottom, left and right edges) [50]. These two forms actually follow the Dirac delta distribution that only focuses on the ground-truth locations but cannot model the ambiguity of bounding boxes as shown in Fig. 1. This is also clearly demonstrated in previous works [7, 19, 29, 39]. In our method, we use the recent probability distribution representation of bounding box [29, 39] which is more comprehensive for describing the localization uncertainty of bounding box. Let e ∈ B be an edge of a bounding box. Its value can be generally represented as label {eq:general} hat {e}=int _{e_{min }}^{e_{max }} x Pr (x) dx,quad ein mathcal {B}, (1) where x is the regression coordinate ranged in [emin, emax], and Pr(x) is the corresponding probability. The conventional Dirac delta representation is a special case of Eqn. (1), where Pr(x) = 1 when x = e gt, otherwise Pr(x) = 0. By quantizing the continuous regression range [emin, emax] into the uniform discretized variable e = [e1, e2, · · · , en] T ∈ R n with n subintervals, where e1 = emin and en = emax, each edge of the given bounding box can be represented as the probability distribution by using the SoftMax function. 3.2. Localization Distillation In this subsection, we present localization distillation (LD), a new way to enhance the distillation efficiency for object detection. Our LD is evolved from the view of probability distribution representation [29] of bounding box which is originally designed for the generic object detection and carries abundant localization information. The ambiguous and clear edges in Fig. 1 will be respectively reflected by the flatness and sharpness of distribution. The working principle of our LD can be seen in Fig. 3. Given an arbitrary dense object detector, following [29], we first switch the bounding box representation from a quaternary representation to a probability distribution. We choose B = {t, b, l, r} as the basic form for bounding box. Unlike the {x, y, w, h} form, the physical meaning of each variable in the {t, b, l, r} form is consistent, which is convenient for us to restrict the probability distribution of each edge to the same interval range. According to [66], there is no performance difference between the two forms. Thus, when the {x, y, w, h} form is given, we will first switch it to the {t, b, l, r} form. Let z be the n logits predicted by the localization head for all possible positions of edge e, denoted by zT and zS for the teacher and the student, respectively. Different from [29,39], we transform zT and zS into probability distributions pT and pS using the generalized SoftMax function S(·, τ ) = SoftMax(·/τ ). Note that when τ = 1, it is equivalent to the original SoftMax function. When τ → 0, it tends to be a Dirac delta distribution. When τ → ∞, it will degrade to be a uniform distribution. Empirically, τ > 1 is set to soften the distribution, making the probability distribution carry more information. The localization distillation for measuring the similarity between the two probabilities pT , pS ∈ R n is attained by: mathcal {L}_text {LD}^e &= mathcal {L}_text {KL}(bm {p}_S^tau ,bm {p}_T^tau ) &= mathcal {L}_text {KL}left (mathcal {S}(bm {z}_S, tau ), mathcal {S}(bm {z}_T, tau )right ), (3) where LKL represents the KL-Divergence loss. Then, LD for all the four edges of bounding box B can be formulated as: mathcal {L}_text {LD} (mathcal {B}_S, mathcal {B}_T)= sum _{e in mathcal {B}} mathcal {L}_text {LD}^{e}. (4) Discussion. Our LD is the first attempt to adopt logit mimicking to distill localization knowledge for object detection. Though the probability distribution representation for boxes has been proven useful in the generic object detection task [29], no one has explored its performance in localization knowledge distillation. We combine the probability distribution representation for boxes and the KLDivergence loss and demonstrate that such a simple logit mimicking technique performs well in improving the distillation efficiency of object detectors. This also makes our LD quite different from previous relevant works that, on the contrary, emphasize the importance of feature imitation. In our experiment section,we will show more numerical analysis on the advantages of the proposed LD. 3.3. Valuable Localization Region Previous works mostly force the deep features of the student to mimic those of the teacher by minimizing the l2 loss. However, a straightforward question should be: Should we use the whole imitation regions without discrimination to distill the hybrid knowledge? According to our observation, the answer is no. Previous works [11, 14, 27, 48, 53] Algorithm 1 Valuable Localization Region Require: A set of anchor boxes Ba l = {Ba il } and a set of ground truth boxes Bgt = {Ba j }, 1 ⩽ il ⩽ Il , 1 ⩽ j ⩽ J, Il = Wl ×Hl. Positive threshold αpos of label assignment. Wl and Hl are the sizes of l-th FPN level. Ensure: Vl = {vilj}Il×J , vilj ∈ {0, 1} encodes final location of VLR, where 1 denotes VLR and 0 indicates ignore. 1: Compute DIoU matrix Xl = {xilj}Il×J with xilj = DIoU(B a il , B gt j ). 2: αvl = γαpos. 3: Select locations with Vl = {αvl ⩽ Xl ⩽ αpos}. 4: return Vl have pointed out that the knowledge distribution patterns are different for classification and localization. Therefore, we, in this subsection, describe the valuable localization region (VLR), to further improve the distillation efficiency, which we believe will be a promising way to train better student detectors. Specifically, the distillation region is divided into two parts, the main distillation region and the valuable localization region. The main distillation region is intuitively determined by label assignment, i.e., the positive locations of the detection head. The valuable localization region can be obtained by Algorithm 1. First, for the l-th FPN level, we calculate the DIoU [67] matrix Xl between all the anchor boxes Ba l and the ground-truth boxes Bgt. Then, we set the lower bound of DIoU to be αvl = γαpos, where αpos is the positive IoU threshold of label assignment. The VLR can be defined as Vl = {αvl ⩽ Xl ⩽ αpos}. Our method has only one hyperparameter γ, which controls the range of the VLRs. When γ = 0, all the locations whose DIoUs between the preset anchor boxes and the GT boxes satisfy 0 ⩽ xilj ⩽ αpos will be determined as VLRs. When γ → 1, the VLR will gradually shrink to empty. Here we use DIoU [67] since it gives higher priority to the locations close to the center of the object. Similar to label assignment, our method assigns attributes to each location across multi-level FPN. In this way, some of locations outside GT boxes will also be considered. So, we can actually view the VLR as an outward extension of the main distillation region. Note that for anchor-free detectors, like FCOS, we can use the preset anchors on feature maps and do not change its regression form so that the localization learning maintains to be anchor-free type. While for anchor-based detectors which usually set multiple anchors per location, we unfold the anchor boxes to ca","output":"The research paper titled \\"Localization Distillation for Dense Object Detection\\" presents a novel approach for distilling knowledge in object detection tasks.

Classification KD is employed to transfer the semantic knowledge by adopting the principle of knowledge distillation on the classification head. LD focuses on distilling the localization knowledge by introducing a probability distribution representation of bounding boxes. The probability distribution representation for bounding boxes captures the localization uncertainty and ambiguity.

LD measures the similarity between the teacher and student probabilities using the KL-Divergence loss. This distillation is performed for all the four edges of the bounding box. To improve distillation efficiency further, the paper introduces Valuable Localization Region (VLR). VLR divides the distillation region into the main distillation region and the valuable localization region. The main distillation region is determined by label assignment, while the VLR is determined based on the DIoU (Distance-IoU) between anchor boxes and ground-truth boxes. The VLR captures valuable localization knowledge that differs from the main distillation region. The paper provides numerical analysis to highlight the advantages of LD and shows that the probability distribution representation combined with KL-Divergence loss performs well in improving the efficiency of object detection distillation.

ИМТ позволяет определить, является ли человек недостаточно весом, нормальным, избыточным или ожиревшим. Однако следует учитывать, что ИМТ не учитывает индивидуальные особенности, такие как мышечная масса, расположение жира в организме и другие факторы, которые могут влиять на общую оценку здоровия. Оценка лишнего веса по ИМТ: - Если ИМТ меньше 18.5, это может указывать на недостаточный вес. - Если ИМТ составляет от 18.5 до 24.9, это считается нормальным весом. - Если ИМТ составляет от 25 до 29.9, это указывает на избыточный вес. - Если ИМТ превышает 30, это может указывать на ожирение. Однако важно отметить, что оценку лишнего веса всегда следует проводить вместе с оценкой общего здоровья, образа жизни, а также с учетом других параметров, таких как обхват талии, процент жира в организме и т.д.

Некоторые из них включают: 1. Обхват талии и бедер: Измеряются обхваты талии и бедер, и сравниваются между собой. Если обхват талии больше, чем обхват бедер, это может указывать на избыточный вес и риск заболеваний связанных с ожирением. 2. Относительный процент жира: С помощью специального оборудования или методов, таких как измерение с помощью сухого водорода или биоимпедансное измерение, можно определить процент жира в организме. Процент жира свыше определенных норм может указывать на избыточный вес. 3. Оценка распределения жира: Распределение жира в организме может иметь значение. Люди с жировым распределением в виде \\"яблока\\" (жир сконцентрирован в области живота) обычно имеют больший риск заболеваний, связанных с ожирением, чем те, у кого жир сконцентрирован в области бедер и ягодиц. 4. Оценка физической формы: оцениваются физические параметры, такие как соотношение мышц и жира в организме, общая физическая активность, сила и выносливость.

It requires subclasses to implement the RaiseAlert and ClearAlert methods to define how an alert should be triggered and cleared, respectively.nn# AreaDetector Classnn`AreaDetector` provides methods for initializing detection areas and updating their states based on the input from tracked clusters. It evaluates whether clusters are within any defined area and updates the status of areas accordingly. It is capable of managing ok, suspected, and alert areas, and it invokes alert mechanisms if necessary.nn# Profile Classnn`Profile` encapsulates different detection profiles that may be used for different types of targets. Each profile has a name, average measurements of the surface and height, weights to these measurements, an alert delay time, and an alert mechanism.nn# ProfileAreaDetector Classnn`ProfileAreaDetector` manages multiple detection profiles and their corresponding `AreaDetector` instances. It updates the detectors based on profiles that clusters are filtered into, ensuring that the correct detection logic is applied for different target types.nn Integration with Other ModulesnnThe `detection.py` script in the [radar_area_detection](radar_area_detection.md) module works in coordination with the [radar_tracking](../radar_tracking/radar_tracking.md) module (tracks objects detected by the radar) and may utilize the alerting infrastructure provided by the `radar_area_detectioncomm` submodule (for example, sending messages via [RabbitMQ](comm/rabbitmq.md)).nn Alert Handling and Data FlownnHere is a high-level overview of the data flow related to the detection process:nn1. Radar data is processed into clusters of points representing detected objects.n2. `ProfileAreaDetector` filters clusters into appropriate profiles.n3. `AreaDetector` detects clusters within designated areas per profile.n4. Upon detecting suspicious activity, a delay timer is initiated before raising an alert.n5. If a cluster remains in a suspicious area past a certain delay, an alert is triggered through the implemented `Alert` subclass.n6. If no suspicious activity is detected, the areas are marked as \\"ok\\" and any active alerts are cleared.nn Developer Notesnn- Alert delay times should be carefully selected based on the sensitivity required and false positive reduction needs.n- Serialization methods in data classes provide an easy means for data to be exported or logged, aiding debugging or analytics processes.nn ConclusionnnThe detection.py script within the radar_area_detection module is central to ensuring the safety and security of monitored areas using FMCW radar technology. It demonstrates a flexible and extensible approach to area detection by employing abstract classes, allowing for customizable alert mechanisms and adaptability for various target profiles. The integration of this script within the radar application plays a significant role in translating raw radar data into actionable alerts and area status updates.nn[Radar Area Detection](radar_area_detection.md)\\"}, {\\"file\\": \\"docsradar_area_detectiondisplay.md\\", \\"doc\\": \\"# radar_area_detection/display.py Documentationnn OverviewnnThe `display.py` script is part of the [radar_area_detection](radar_area_detection.md) module, which integrates with the area detection and object tracking functionalities.

It provides parameters that define detection areas, the delay before an alert is raised, and camera alert settings. Configuration Parameters Here is an example of the `detection_conf.json` content: ```json { \\"areas\\": [[-1, 1, 0.5, 2.5]], \\"alert_delay_time\\": 0, \\"camera\\": { \\"enable\\": true, \\"ip\\": \\"127.0.0.1\\", \\"port\\": 5000 } } ``` # Areas The `areas` parameter specifies the geometric boundaries of detection zones. Each area is defined by a list of 4 values representing a rectangle with the following boundaries: - Left boundary (x-coordinate) - Right boundary (x-coordinate) - Bottom boundary (y-coordinate) - Top boundary (y-coordinate) For example, `[-1, 1, 0.5, 2.5]` defines an area that extends from -1 to 1 on the x-axis (left to right), and from 0.5 to 2.5 on the y-axis (bottom to top). # Alert Delay Time The `alert_delay_time` parameter defines the time delay, in seconds, before an alert is triggered after a detection event. This delay can be crucial for filtering out false positives or insignificant movements within the area. # Camera This subsection of the configuration file specifies settings for a camera alert system, which can be enabled to react to detection events identified by the radar system. - `enable`: A boolean value that turns the camera alert function on or off. - `ip`: The IP address to connect to the camera. - `port`: The port number used to communicate with the camera. Integration with Other Modules The detection settings configured in `detection_conf.json` direct the behavior of scripts such as `detection.py` and `camera_alert.py` within the `radar_area_detection` module. - `detection.py` uses the areas and alert delay time to manage the detection logic for the FMCW radar system. - `camera_alert.py` uses the camera settings to control the camera for recording/alerting purposes when an event is detected within the specified areas. Usage For developers or system integrators: 1. Edit the `detection_conf.json` file to specify the precise areas for detection according to the physical environment and the requirements of the radar system. 2. Adjust the `alert_delay_time` to balance between immediate alerts and minimizing false alarms. 3. Configure the camera settings to enable visual validation or add another layer of security by linking camera recordings to radar detections. Developer Notes - When defining detection areas, coordinate and range accuracy is imperative. Ensure the radar\'s position and orientation are calibrated and accurately reflected in the area definitions. - The alert mechanism, including camera use, should be tested to verify that the system\'s responses are timely and accurate based on the `alert_delay_time`. - An active network connection with proper permissions and firewall settings must be established to ensure the camera system can receive commands from the radar system. Conclusion The `detection_conf.json` file is central to setting up the radar area detection framework, defining where within the physical space the radar is monitoring and how it responds to potential intrusions or movement. Proper configuration of this file enables a cohesive area monitoring and alerting system that reacts appropriately to real-world events, ensuring a secure and responsive radar application.

It requires subclasses to implement the RaiseAlert and ClearAlert methods to define how an alert should be triggered and cleared, respectively.nn# AreaDetector Classnn`AreaDetector` provides methods for initializing detection areas and updating their states based on the input from tracked clusters. It evaluates whether clusters are within any defined area and updates the status of areas accordingly. It is capable of managing ok, suspected, and alert areas, and it invokes alert mechanisms if necessary.nn# Profile Classnn`Profile` encapsulates different detection profiles that may be used for different types of targets. Each profile has a name, average measurements of the surface and height, weights to these measurements, an alert delay time, and an alert mechanism.nn# ProfileAreaDetector Classnn`ProfileAreaDetector` manages multiple detection profiles and their corresponding `AreaDetector` instances. It updates the detectors based on profiles that clusters are filtered into, ensuring that the correct detection logic is applied for different target types.nn Integration with Other ModulesnnThe `detection.py` script in the [radar_area_detection](radar_area_detection.md) module works in coordination with the [radar_tracking](../radar_tracking/radar_tracking.md) module (tracks objects detected by the radar) and may utilize the alerting infrastructure provided by the `radar_area_detectioncomm` submodule (for example, sending messages via [RabbitMQ](comm/rabbitmq.md)).nn Alert Handling and Data FlownnHere is a high-level overview of the data flow related to the detection process:nn1. Radar data is processed into clusters of points representing detected objects.n2. `ProfileAreaDetector` filters clusters into appropriate profiles.n3. `AreaDetector` detects clusters within designated areas per profile.n4. Upon detecting suspicious activity, a delay timer is initiated before raising an alert.n5. If a cluster remains in a suspicious area past a certain delay, an alert is triggered through the implemented `Alert` subclass.n6. If no suspicious activity is detected, the areas are marked as \\"ok\\" and any active alerts are cleared.nn Developer Notesnn- Alert delay times should be carefully selected based on the sensitivity required and false positive reduction needs.n- Serialization methods in data classes provide an easy means for data to be exported or logged, aiding debugging or analytics processes.nn ConclusionnnThe detection.py script within the radar_area_detection module is central to ensuring the safety and security of monitored areas using FMCW radar technology. It demonstrates a flexible and extensible approach to area detection by employing abstract classes, allowing for customizable alert mechanisms and adaptability for various target profiles.

It extends the visualization capabilities of the `TrackingDisplay2D` class from the `radar_tracking` module to provide real-time updates of the radar\'s area detection results. File Structure `display.py` includes two main classes: - `AreasDisplay2D`: Inherits from `TrackingDisplay2D` and is used to display detection areas and their statuses. - `ProfilesDisplay2D`: Inherits from `TrackingDisplay2D` and is used to display detection areas with profile-specific information. # AreasDisplay2D Class The `AreasDisplay2D` class visualizes detection areas on a 2D display, differentiating between areas that are clear (ok) and those that have an active alert. Constructor - `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Initializes the `AreasDisplay2D` class with arguments passed to its superclass and initializes an empty list for patches. Attributes - `patches`: List. Stores the drawing patches corresponding to areas on the display. Methods - `_prepare_draw(self, clusters, ok_areas: List[Area], alert_areas: List[Area])`: Internally prepares the drawing of the clusters and areas. It removes any existing patches and re-adds them according to the updated area states. - `show(self, clusters, area_detector: AreaDetector)`: Public method to display the radar clusters and areas. This method calls `_prepare_draw` with the `ok_areas` and `alert_areas` from an `AreaDetector` instance and then proceeds to draw the updated visualization. # ProfilesDisplay2D Class The `ProfilesDisplay2D` class is similar to `AreasDisplay2D` but includes additional functionality to display profile-specific information. Constructor - Inherits the constructor from `AreasDisplay2D`. Methods - `_prepare_draw(self, profileAreaDetector, clusters)`: Prepares the drawing of clusters and areas with profile-specific information. - `show(self, profileAreaDetector, clusters)`: Displays the radar clusters and areas with profile-specific information. It calls `_prepare_draw` and updates the visualization accordingly. Integration with Other Modules The `display.py` script interacts with the `AreaDetector` and `ProfileAreaDetector` classes from the `radar_area_detection.detection` module to visualize active areas and alerts. It also uses functionality from the `radar_tracking` module\'s visualization utilities. Usage Developers can instantiate the `AreasDisplay2D` or `ProfilesDisplay2D` class to visualize the area detection results in the context of FMCW radar applications. This enables a graphical representation of which areas are clear and which are under alert or suspected. Data Flow 1. An instance of `AreasDisplay2D` or `ProfilesDisplay2D` is created with appropriate arguments. 2. Radar data (clusters) and area statuses are processed by an `AreaDetector` or `ProfileAreaDetector`. 3. Area statuses and clusters are passed to the display instance\'s `show` method. 4. The `show` method updates the visual representation according to the current state of detection areas and tracked clusters. Developer Notes - Use the display classes to create a visual feedback loop for area detection and alert visualization in real-time radar applications. - Ensure active areas and their statuses are correctly updated and reflected in the visualization to provide continuous situational awareness. - The visual representation is crucial for debugging and monitoring the radar area detection functionality, hence strive for clear visual distinction between different states for better readability and interpretation. Conclusion `display.py` within the `radar_area_detection` module serves a pivotal role in visually representing the status of detection areas in real-time. The `AreasDisplay2D` and `ProfilesDisplay2D` classes demonstrate an effective integration of visualization techniques with radar detection and tracking capabilities. It contributes to the wider goal of creating a modular and adaptable system for FMCW radar applications.

This script is particularly focused on the creation and configuration of alert types based on the system\'s requirements. Utility Functions # AlertType Enum `AlertType` is an enumeration that defines the different types of alerts supported by the radar system. Currently, it includes the following: - `CAMERA`: Represents an alert that triggers camera actions. # get_alert_from_conf Function This function is responsible for creating an alert object based on the configuration provided. Parameters - `alert_conf`: A dictionary containing the configuration for the alert. It must include a `type` key that specifies the type of alert (e.g., \\"camera\\") and an `args` key that contains the necessary arguments for the alert type. Returns - Returns an instance of the alert object configured according to `alert_conf`. For example, if the `type` is \\"camera\\", it returns an instance of `CameraAlert`. Usage ```python alert_conf = { \\"type\\": \\"camera\\", \\"args\\": { \\"ip\\": \\"192.168.1.100\\", \\"port\\": 5000 } } alert_instance = AlertType.get_alert_from_conf(alert_conf) ``` Integration with Other Modules The `utils.py` script interacts with the `radar_area_detection.comm.camera_alert` module to instantiate camera alerts. It can be extended to support additional alert types as the system evolves. Developer Notes - When adding new alert types, extend the `AlertType` enum and update the `get_alert_from_conf` function to handle the new type. - Ensure that the configuration for each alert type is well-documented and validated to prevent runtime errors. - Consider implementing a factory pattern if the number of alert types increases significantly, to maintain clean and scalable code. Conclusion The `utils.py` script in the `radar_EPS` module plays a vital role in the flexible configuration and management of alert mechanisms within the radar system. By providing a centralized way to instantiate alert objects, it contributes to the modularity and extensibility of the project, allowing for rapid development and integration of new functionalities.

Рассмотрение словарных статей дает возможность сделать ряд наблюдений. а) Словарь написан не русским, а греком. В основном это дву­ язычный греко-славянский ономастикой. Словник его расположен по греческому алфавиту. В тех случаях, когда объясняемое имя оказывается по происхождению не греческим, а латинским или еврейским, чаще всего перевод делается на греческий язык, а за­ тем уже па славянский. Принадлежность слова к греческому языку не оговаривается. Латинские и другие имена всегда сопро­ вождаются указанием, из какого языка они заимствованы.382 Словообразовательный и этимологический анализ слов находится в полном соответствии с византийской лексикографической тра­ дицией, вполне согласуются с ней и энциклоцедические статьи «Толкованія. . .». Наконец, и ономастический принцип обучения, 382 См. «Тип словаря „Толковаіе именамъ по алфавиту“ и его лексический состав» — с. 146. 181 на который такой словарь, по всей видимости, был рассчитан (выяснилось при рассмотрении порядка следования статей), ука­ зывает на византийскую практику.383 С помощью ономастики в данном случае осуществлялось знакомство с составом известного числа греческих слов, со значениями многих корней и форман­ тов. В то же время важной задачей оставалось и объяснение зна­ чений имен собственных, принятых восточной (православной) церковью.

Наибольшая ценность «Толкованія. . .» и его оригинальность — не в номенклатурной (иноязычной), а в тол­ кующей (славянской) части. Соотнесения типа «кувикуларіи — постельникъ црвъ»; «сѵтлитікъ— боляринъ введепыи» говорят о стремлении автора соотнести иноязычную терминологию с рус­ ской жизнью.

В качестве од­ ного из убедительных примеров можно привести следующий. Мы видели, что автор «Толкованія. . .» стремится избежать в своих объяснениях данных, которые могли бы связать имена, принятые христанской церковью, с именами языческими, идущими от ан­ тичной мифологии. Это соответствует не только мыслям, не раз высказанным в сочинениях Максима,384385но даже и методу кри­ тики, который он применил в одном из «Слов отвещательных» по отношению к ошибочному, с его точки зрения, переводу грече­ ского слова osioi3atp.ové3repoç. Слово было переведено согласно с античным пониманием его значения — богобоязнѣиіиии. Максим считает, как уже упоминалось, что перевод здесь может быть только бісобоязнеишии (дисисъ (Ssîoiç) бо боязнь, а дѣмони (oa\'jiovsç) бѣси толкуются).386 В параллель приведем и еще один не менее убедительный факт.

Наличие их вместе с тем показывает, что обнаружение в каком-нибудь из списков памятника болгарских, сербских или иных черт — еще не есть непременное свидетельство его происхождения. Перед нами — памятник с собственно рус­ ской историей. Болгарские и сербские черты появились в нем не в силу миграции текста и даже не из-за литературных влияний, а связаны с личной биографией автора Словаря, который к тому же был греком, а не сербом, болгарином или русским. Вскрыть при­ чину их появления позволило изучение литературной истории текста, а исчезновение их при переписке характеризует тенденции в развитии русской орфографии исследуемого периода. Анализ показывает, что текст «Толкованія. . .» в указанном отношении претерпевал эволюцию. Все четыре списка I редак­ ции, относящиеся ко второй половине XVI в., имеют известное число среднеболгарских и сербских написаний. Все они восходят к протографу, но по спискам набор этих примет неодинаков, каждый писец устранял то, что ему представлялось инородным или в чем он не усматривал правила, пусть и неизвестного ему прежде. Кроме того, можно отметить разное соотношение анали­ зируемых примет: в Соловецком списке (ГПБ Сол. 498 (479)) больше болгаризмов, ЦГИАЛ СССР, ф. 834, оп. 3, д. 3990 также имеет немало болгарских написаний, но основная их часть отли­ чается от тех, что остались в Соловецком списке, в ГБЛ МДА 173 (35) по преимуществу сохранились сербизмы, в ГПБ ОЛДП F. 184 (131), которому особенно присущи специфически русские черты, южнославянские написания попадаются намного реже, чем в трех других списках.翻译成汉语","output":"在归属“按字母顺序解释名字”时，最重要的是，在字典的早期手稿中出现了与马克西姆的自书本相同的保加利亚和塞尔维亚的书写特征，而且由于文本内容更加丰富，这些特征在字典中的数量更多。这些特征的存在同时也显示，仅在某一手稿中发现保加利亚人、塞尔维亚人或其他特征，并不能必然证明它的起源。我们面对的是一部有着其特有的俄罗斯历史的文献。作为一个希腊人，而非塞尔维亚人、保加利亚人或俄罗斯人，字典作者在作品中涉及保加利亚和塞尔维亚特征，并非由于文本的移动，甚至也不是由于文学影响，而是和作者的个人经历有关。文本的文学历史研究揭示了这些特征出现的原因，其在抄写过程中的消失则反映了我们研究时期俄罗斯拼写发展的趋势。 分析显示，《解释名字...》的文本在这方面经历了演变。所有四份归于十六世纪下半叶的第一版手稿都具有一定数量的中古保加利亚和塞尔维亚书写方式。它们全部源自同一原版手稿，但各份手稿中这些特征的组合并不相同，每位抄写员摒弃了他认为是外来的或者他未曾知晓规则的东西。此外，有必要指出各个手稿分析特征的不同比例：例如，索洛韦茨基手稿（ГПБ Сол. 498 (479)）中有更多的保加利亚特征，ЦГИАЛ СССР, ф. 834, оп. 3, д. 3990 也包含了相当多的保加利亚书写方式，但其主要部分与索洛韦茨基手稿内的保留内容有所不同。在ГБЛ МДА 173 (35)中主要保留了塞尔维亚特征，而ГПБ ОЛДП F. 184 (131)则尤其带有明显的俄罗斯特色，其中的南斯拉夫书写方式比其他三份手稿要少得多。"},{"instruction":"请润色文字","output":"在归属《按字母顺序解释名字》的过程中，最关键的发现是，字典的早期手稿中出现了与马克西姆·希腊人亲笔原稿相同的保加利亚和塞尔维亚书写特点，这些特征考虑到文本的广泛性，在字典中显然更为常见。同时，这些特点的存在也表明，单纯在文献的某份手稿中发现保加利亚、塞尔维亚或其他区域特征，并不直接证明它的原始出处。我们面临的是一份具有鲜明俄罗斯历史的文献遗产。字典作者身为希腊人，并非塞尔维亚人、保加利亚人或俄罗斯人，他在文本中加入了保加利亚和塞尔维亚的特征，并非由于文本的文字漂移，甚至不是出于文学影响，而是与作者的个人经历息息相关。对文本文学历史的研究揭开了这些特征出现的原因，而这些特征在抄写过程中的消失，映射出我们研究阶段俄罗斯正字法发展的倾向。 进一步的分析表明，《解释名字...》的文本在这个方面经历了不断的演化。所有四份被追溯到十六世纪下半叶的第一版手稿均展现了一定数量的中古保加利亚和塞尔维亚书写风格。透过各份手稿，我们可以追溯到共同的原始资料，但每份手稿中这些书写特征的集合各不相同，每个抄写者排除了他们认为是外来的或者是他们之前未知的规则内容。此外，还需要注意不同手稿间分析特征的比例差异：例如，索洛韦茨基手稿（ГПБ Сол. 498 (479)）含有更多的保加利亚特色；ЦГИАЛ СССР, ф. 834, оп. 3, д. 3990 同样包括了许多保加利亚书写形式，但它们与索洛韦茨基手稿中保留的内容主要不同；ГБЛ МДА 173 (35)主要保留了塞尔维亚的书写风貌；而ГПБ ОЛДП F. 184 (131)，作为独特的俄罗斯特色的代表，其中出现的南斯拉夫书写方式要比其他三份手稿明显减少。"},{"instruction":"Принадлежность текста Словаря Максиму Греку получает в этих примерах средпеболгарских и сербских написаний отчет­ ливое формальное доказательство.翻译成汉语","output":"在这些中古保加利亚和塞尔维亚书写实例中，将字典文本归属于马克西姆·希腊人得到了明确的形式证明。"},{"instruction":"О литературном стиле Максима Грека (в связи с его научными трудими) Словарь «Толкованіе именамъ по алфавиту» тесно связан с од­ ной из наиболее характерных черт писательского стиля Максима Грека •— применением composita.

В шести списках оказались дополнения, отличающие вторую редакцию от первой. К III редакции относится 8 списков. Всего в нашем распоряжении 24 списка Словаря и 6 списков дополнений к его тексту. Все списки, кроме списков I редакции, обнаружены в собраниях сочинений Максима Грека, причем и из числа наиболее ранних. Из пяти списков I редакции четыре относятся ко второй поло­ вине XVI в., к тому же периоду принадлежат еще и два списка II редакции. Наиболее ранний список III редакции датируется рубежом XVI—XVII вв. История списков «Толкованія. . .» свидетельствует об обстоя­ тельности работы по составлению Словаря. Это пе был единовре­ менный акт. Исходный текст Словаря дополнялся и отрабаты­ вался в несколько приемов. Особого внимания заслуживают результаты текстологического анализа «Перечня дополнений», который встречается в некоторых типах собраний сочинений Максима в виде сводки в 36 словарных статей. При сравнении списков трех редакций текст этого перечня расслаивается на три хронологически следующие друг за другом группы добавок к протографу «Толкованія. . .» (6-|-54-25), иными словами, он и является сводом указанных трехкратных добав­ лений. Списки I редакции, имеющиеся у нас в наличии, отражают первый и второй этапы введения новых материалов (6 |-5), списки II редакции — все три этапа, а списки III редакции только пер­ вый этап. Это обстоятельство текстологически разъясняют II и III редакции Словаря, обнаруживая, что между ними нет преем­ ственной связи. Вместе с тем основой для обеих редакций послу­ жила I редакция, причем при III редакции был использован вариант более близкий к протографу, так как в него еще пе вошли пополнения на ряд букв (введено 6 статей из 11). При сопоставлении списков трех редакций выясняется, каков был первоначальный состав Словаря как по содержанию, так и по количеству статей.437 В нем было 239 статей: две из них в I ре­ дакции пропущены, но эта редакция имеет, кроме корпуса сло­ варя, соотносимого с архетипом, еще 11 статей добавок, идущих в каждой из букв после статей исходного состава, а вслед за ними оказались добавленными еще 9 статей, уже не соотносимых с пе­ речнем и не подтвержденных корреспондирующими материалами двух других редакций. Каждый из списков имеет пропуски, слия-йия статей и другие искажения текста, возникшие при копирова­ нии, по по совокупности данных ее состав должен быть определен в количестве 250 статей и 9 статей, приписанных в более позднее время.

Наиболее ранние списки «Толкова­ нія. . .», представляющие его I редакцию, не являлись еще окон­ чательным авторским текстом. Он сложился лишь во II редакции. В ней в сравнении с предшествующим вариантом более богат словник, большая точность написаний и акцентуации, что, не­ сомненно, свидетельствует о совершенствовании и выверке текста. Число найденных списков этой редакции вдвое превышает число копий I редакции (5 и 11), именно эта редакция, а не первая, включена в состав собраний сочинений Максима Грека, в том числе и очень ранних. Книжники конца XVI в. считали ее основ­ ной. Старшие списки Словаря II редакции относятся к тому же периоду, что и списки первой, то есть к этапу, непосредственно примыкающему ко времени переводческой и лексикографической деятельности Максима. Создатели ранних собраний более всего были озабочены тем, чтобы не утратить ни одного из его сочине­ ний. Завершение III редакции очень близко ко времени оконча­ ния работ над II редакцией. Они создавались параллельно. Одна из них может быть названа третьей лишь потому, что хроноло­ гически появилась позже другой и принадлежит последователям Максима, а не ему самому. Создателей этой редакции вдохновляла уже другая идея: продолжить и развить начинания Максима Грека. III редакция отличается от двух других тем, что в нее широко влились толкования, не связанные непосредственно с лексикогра­ фической практикой Максима, почерпнутые из других источников, словарных и несловарных. Не являясь вполне оригинальной, имен­ но эта редакция стала прототипом Азбуковника, поэтому роль ее в истории лексикографии Московской Руси весьма значительна.

Цель его другая. Знакомство со Словарем позволяло через собственные имена усвоить значения многих греческих корней и основ. Вместе с тем Словарь не утрачивал и свойств ономастикона, однако имена, приводимые в этом Словаре, уже не соотносились лишь с опреде­ ленными лицами (в «Рѣчи жидовьскаго языка» — с библейскими персонажами). Словообразовательный аспект «Толкованія. . .» — вне сомнений. Это доказывается порядком следования многих статей, а также наличием статей, где имена с одинаковой и близ­ кой основой объединены в одну статью или связь с предыдущей статьей показана отсылкой. Итак, анализ греческих, латинских и еврейских имен дается в Словаре для того, чтобы желающий мог уяснить состав слова и освоить значения иноязычных лексем. Вместе с тем «Толкованіе. . .» — это переводный двуязычный лексикон (греко-славянский, латино-славянский). В Словаре в полной мере сказалась искусность перевода. Предлагаемые соответствия постоянно варьируются, такие варианты относятся и к форме передачи значения, и к его содержанию. Анализ статей Словаря показывает, какое внимание автор его уделял основному вопросу переводческой практики — степени адекватности передачи значений слов переводимого языка. Из них явствует вместе с тем, насколько тщательно была использо­ вана славянская синонимика. В принципе автор стремится не допустить, чтобы разные греческие имена имели одинаковое объяснение. Уделено внимание и омонимическим отношениям слов. Переводы имен указывают на серьезную филологическую осведомленность толкователя и позволяет оценить Словарь как источник по истории русской лексики, заслуживающий полного доверия. В Словаре встречаются переводы имен нарицательных, но в основном их находим в объяснениях имен собственных как один из приемов раскрытия их значений. В Словаре применено несколько типов определений: перевод слова (синонимы, описательные обороты), истолкование имени, сопровождаемое этимологическим анализом, энциклопедический комментарий к называемому лицу, месту или реалии. Совокупность разносторонних данных позволяет с уверен­ ностью решить вопрос об авторе Словаря; рассмотрение словника и толкований дает возможность сделать следующие заключения: 1) Словарь написан не русским, а греком. Это видно по сле­ дующим приметам: а) в тех случаях, когда объясняемое имя ока­ зывается по происхождению не греческим, а латинским или еврей­ ским, перевод делается на греческий, а затем уже на славянский; б) принадлежность слова к греческому языку не оговаривается, в то время как латинские и другие имена всегда сопровождаются указанием, из какого языка они заимствованы; в) словообразова­ 204 тельный и этимологический анализ слов соответствует византий­ ской лексикографической традиции, согласуются с ней и энцик­ лопедические статьи «Толкованія. . .», и ономастический прин­ цип обучения, на который, ио всей видимости, такой словарь и был рассчитан.翻译成汉语","output":"词典中主要描述了专有名词，但在其他方面它不像古代的地名学著作。它有着不同的目标。通过词典熟悉专有名词，可以掌握许多希腊语词根和基础词汇的含义。同时，词典并没有失去作为地名学工具的特点，但在这个词典中引用的名字已不再只与特定的个人相联系（例如在《希伯来语言的说法》中则是与圣经人物相关）。《解释名字...》的构词层面毋庸置疑。这一点不仅由许多条目的排列顺序所证明，还因为有些条目会将具有相同或类似词根的名字组合在一个条目中，或者通过引用与前一条目建立联系来表明它们之间的关联。因此，词典中对希腊语、拉丁语和希伯来语的名字进行分析，这样有意愿的人可以理解词汇的构成并掌握外语词汇的含义。 同时，《解释名字...》也是一本双语（希腊-斯拉夫，拉丁-斯拉夫）的翻译词典。词典展示了翻译的巧妙，提供的对应翻译不断变化，既有形式上的也有内容上的。 对词典条目的分析表明，作者格外注重翻译实践中的一个主要问题——传达源语言单词含义的准确程度。这个问题的深入也显示了斯拉夫近义词的精心运用。原则上，作者试图避免不同的希腊名字有相同的解释。他还关注了词汇的同义关系。名字的翻译显示出解释者的深厚语言学知识，使得词典成为值得信赖的俄罗斯词汇史的资源。 词典中也包含了通用名称的翻译，但主要在对专有名词的解释中找到，作为揭示其意义的一种技巧。 词典运用了几种类型的定义：词语的翻译（同义词，描述性短语）、名字的解释伴随着词源分析、关于被命名者、地点或实物的百科评论。 多方面的数据总结使得我们能够自信地解决词典作者的问题；对词汇和解释的审视允许我们得出以下结论： 1) 词典的作者不是俄罗斯人而是希腊人。这从以下特点可以看出：a) 当解释的名字原本不是希腊语而是拉丁语或希伯来语时，会先翻译成希腊语然后再翻译成斯拉夫语；b) 如果单词属于希腊语则不需要特别声明，而拉丁语或其他语言的名字总是附有说明它们借用自哪种语言；c) 单词的构词和词源分析符合拜占庭的词典编纂传统，这也适用于《解释名字...》中的百科条目以及似乎是这种词典所针对的地名学教学原则。"},{"instruction":"2) Словарь написан человеком знакомым с русской действи­ тельностью, автор его - участник лексикографических начинаний Московской Руси: «Толкованіе. . .» — предшественник азбуковни­ ков, а затем и «Лексикона треязычпого» Федора Поликарпова; наибольшая ценность «Толкованія. . .» и его оригинальность — не в номенклатурной (иноязычной), а в толкующей (славянской) части, а также в стремлении автора соотнести иноязычную терми­ нологию с русской жизнью. 3) Словарь полностью согласуется с опытом переводческой и исправительской деятельности в Московской Руси, видным пред­ ставителем которой в XVI в. был Максим Грек.

Задача эта поставлена и в существенной части выполнена в книге М. П. Алексеева «Словари иностранных язы­ ков в русском азбуковнике XVII века». Знакомство с библиографическими материалами и их анализом убеждает, что одни из словарных жанров активно развивались в названную эпоху во всех упоминаемых в исследовании европей­ ских странах, обнаруживая типологическую общность. Заметны однако расхождения и непосредственных источников, и целей вы­ полняемых работ. Другие словарные жанры не проявляют в своей истории синхронности: то, что характерно для некоторых евро­ пейских стран в XVI в., становится существенным в русской лексикографии лишь со второй половины XVII в. На рубеже XVI—XVII вв. деятельность весьма многочислен­ ных в то время лексикографов Западной Европы, отмечает автор, приобретает такие особенности, какие не были присущи ей ра­ нее, причем тенденции, наметившиеся тогда в словарных работах, в течение XVII столетия сложились в особое направление, кото­ рое отчетливо проявило себя в словарях различных стран.1 С конца XVI в. в результате собирательской работы глоссато­ ров начинают создаваться многоязычные словари (trésors des langues du monde) — компиляции с хаотически пестрым словни­ ком. Особенно типичными становятся словари иностранных слов в родном языке — английском, французском, немецком. Отметим со своей стороны, что словари подобного рода создавались в пе­ риод, который непосредственно предшествовал разработкам, зало­ жившим основы для создания первых толковых словарей нацио­ нальных языков.翻译成汉语","output":"第三章 字母书编纂过程 导言 我们不能高估比较16至17世纪俄罗斯词典作品与同一时期其他欧洲国家词典学的重要性。这个任务已经提出，并在相当程度上在М.

Примени­ тельно к английскому языку автор указывает на следующие: воз­ рождение античной науки привело к тому, что в английский язык было введено огромное количество «ученых слов» латинского, древнегреческого, арабского происхождения и т. д. Составлялись поэтому и перечни этих трудных для понимания и усвоения слов, которые тогда же объединялись в словари. В 1604 г. Робертом Коудри был издан один из первых словарей такого рода. В назва­ нии его разъяснялось, что в нем собраны «трудные» слова (ср. в наших словарях — «неудобь познаваемые рѣчи»), заимствован­ ные из еврейского, греческого, латинского и французского язы­ ков.2 «Та же тенденция подбирать и объединять в особых переч­ нях „трудные“ слова, новообразования и варваризмы проявила себя и в других странах Европы».3 В течение всего XVI в. соби­ рали архаические слова из памятников предшествующих столе­ тий итальянские лексикографы («Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca». Venezia, 1612). Словарь был составлен с помощью более ранних рукописных глоссариев. Французские словари эпохи Возрождения также вбирали в себя более ранние рукопис­ ные своды глосс. В Германии первый словарь такого типа был издан в 1571 г. Автор его, Симон Рот, называл свой словарь: «Немецкий дикциопср, или Толкователь трудных неизвестных слов немецких, греческих, латинских, еврейских, итальянских, а также и других пародов». В 1616 г. вышел большой словарь Георга Хениша, среди языков, перечисленных в его названии, — два славянских (чешский и польский). Одним из основных сло­ варных источников этой «Сокровищницы германских языка и мудрости» были труды швейцарца Конрада Геснера. Они оказали, как отмечает М. П. Алексеев, «весьма сильное воздействие на развитие лексикографии во второй половине XVI в., в частности в славянских землях».4 Самая крупная из его работ, изданная в 1555 г., озаглавлена «Митридат, или Наблюдения над различ­ ными языками как древними, так и новыми, употребляемыми ныне у различных народов земного шара».

П.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed.

Her hands never waver, her eyes never stray. The readouts wink back at her with promising data, and the compound finally takes form—a vial shining with the hope of humanity. MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker.

CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT.

A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above.

Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT. OUTER LAYERS OF THE CITY - CONTINUOUS Overhead shots reveal fiery blooms littering the landscape, each a bitter bloom of conflict. Plumes of smoke claw at the sky, trying to blanket the sun with their unforgiving shadows. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Panic fractures Ed’s stoicism as the bunker’s survival systems activate in response to the escalating threat. Crimson alarms flare, casting a sinister glow. The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed clutches at debris, dragging his altered body across the trembling floor, desperately attempting to anchor himself in a world that refuses stillness. His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE – DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

CHANCELLOR WEST, respected in academia, approaches with a firm HANDSHAKE. CHANCELLOR WEST (to Ed, with GRAVITAS) Remarkable, Ed! The city’s abuzz with excitement. ED (humbly proud) It’s teamwork, Chancellor. Coming together for a breakthrough. Maria nods in AGREEMENT, a proud smile spreading across her face. CUT TO: A private alcove casts shadows on a DEBATE between DR. ROSENBERG and MS. SHARPE, a discussion etched with CONCERN and ETHICAL weight. DR. ROSENBERG (concerned) The box is opened… can they now control what spills forth? MS. SHARPE (intellectual poise) Profound implications. Only time will reveal if their AMBITION precedes CAUTION. ACROSS THE ROOM Ed and Maria are locked in lively discourse with YOUNG INVESTORS, spreading EXCITEMENT about their research while REMAINING grounded in their ethical RESPONSIBILITIES. MARIA (to investors, reassuring) Our work dives deep. It touches the future with a REQUIRED MORAL compass. YOUNG INVESTOR #1 (toasting, enthused) To a NEW AGE! An era defined by your vision!

The door EASES open; ED enters, pauses, then softly closes it, sealing away the clamor of their triumphant evening. CUT TO: CLOSE ON MARIA’S face, the city lights cast shimmering TEARS upon her cheeks. MARIA (Voice quivering with emotion) Today was extraordinary, Ed. But I feel unease… Like being on the cusp of a precipice we can’t see. ED approaches, encircling her waist with his arms, a gesture that FUSES their strength and resolve. ED (embracing her, comfortingly) Today, we stepped into the unknown, trusting in our work, in ourselves. Fear is the echo of our responsibility. Now entwined, ED and MARIA gaze upon the city—as vibrant as their aspirations, as precarious as their CREATION. CUT TO: TWO-SHOT - ED, chin on MARIA’S shoulder, they stand as mend to the LUMINOSITY of their victories and their VULNERABILITIES.

MARIA (her voice lilting, playful) Just another day at the office for the Kaynes duo. Their car pulls into the driveway, the engine purring to a halt. The night’s embrace cocoons them, a momentary pause in the relentless march of their lives. ED (softly, as they sit in the car) This is it, our leap into the unknown. Our work—our love—could change everything. MARIA reaches out, her hand finding ED’s in the darkness. A silent connection that speaks louder than words—a promise of unity against the shadows they’ve cast. MARIA (squeezing his hand, earnestly) No matter what tomorrow brings, we face it together, Ed. Side by side, come what may. The LIGHTS from their house beckon, a warm glow against the dark, an anchor amidst the storm of change they’ve set in motion. ED (grasping her hand, conviction in his voice) As long as we have each other, Maria. We can face eternity. Their doors open, and they step out into the night, hand in hand—their bond a beacon against the uncertainty that awaits. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 15 OF 150 PAGE 16 OF 150 (REDUCED): INT.

Their conversation is intimate, a DEFIANT DECLARATION against the pressure of their own breakthroughs. MARIA (her eyes sparkling with love) To think… we’re on the precipice of ETERNITY. ED (matching her intensity) With you, every DISCOVERY, every risk is worth taking. Our PASSION fuels more than just science. Their glasses CLINK, an ACCORD struck not just to their UNION but to the paradigms they dare to shift. ED (with a rare earnestness) Against the vastness of TIME, it’s US, together. Locked in step against the depths of the UNKNOWN. Their embrace is the EPICENTER of the room. Any DISTRACTIONS, the awards, the accolades, recede into insignificance against their shared moment. MARIA (repoising with a soft fierceness) As long as we STAND together, no MYSTERY too vast, no challenge too daunting. Their kiss marks an EPOCH – an ERA of their own making.

His EYES SNAP open, on EDGE, and FEAR takes hold as he spots several FIGURES moving with an unsettling, LURCHING gait towards him. The RAGGED SILHOUETTES grow clearer - ZOMBIES in various stages of DECAY. WASTING no time, the MAN scrambles to his feet, but his movements are SLUGGISH, still dulled by sleep. He turns to FLEE, but the UNDEAD descend upon him with RELENTLESS HUNGER. His PANICKED SCREAMS shatter the SILENCE of the NIGHT, a SYMPHONY of TERROR that marks the DAWN of a new HORROR.

Las plantillas ortopédicas pueden brindar soporte adicional al arco del pie, redistribuir el peso de manera más equitativa y alinear mejor el pie y la pierna durante la marcha. En el caso de los pies planos, las plantillas están diseñadas para apoyar el arco longitudinal del pie, lo que puede ayudar a aliviar la presión sobre los músculos y ligamentos, disminuir el dolor y prevenir la progresión de la condición. Para el genus valgus, que se caracteriza por rodillas que se inclinan hacia adentro, las plantillas pueden corregir desequilibrios y mejorar la alineación de las rodillas y caderas al caminar. Es importante tener en cuenta que, aunque las plantillas pueden proporcionar alivio a corto y mediano plazo y mejorar la función, es poco probable que corrijan completamente los pies planos o el genus valgus en adultos, ya que la estructura ósea y las alineaciones del pie ya están desarrolladas. Sin embargo, pueden prevenir que las condiciones empeoren y ayudar en la gestión de cualquier dolor o incomodidad asociada. Para obtener los mayores beneficios de las plantillas ortopédicas, deben ser personalizadas y recomendadas por un profesional de la salud, como un podólogo, un ortopédico o un fisioterapeuta, después de una evaluación completa de su pisada y estructura del pie.

public class EffectMover : MonoBehaviour { public Transform targetPosition; // 目标位置 public float speed = 10.0f; // 特效移动速度 private bool isMoving = false; // 是否开始移动 // 在需要的时候调用，开始发射特效 public void LaunchEffect(Transform startPosition, Transform target) { // 设置特效的起始位置 transform.position = startPosition.position;

// 如果到达目标位置，停止移动特效 if (transform.position == targetPosition.position) { isMoving = false; // 特效到达目标位置之后的逻辑，例如销毁特效对象 // Destroy(gameObject); } } } } ``` 在这个脚本中，函数`LaunchEffect`被调用来开始特效的移动，它需要一个起始位置和目标位置。在`Update`函数中，我们检查`isMoving`变量来判断是否需要移动特效，然后使用`Vector3.MoveTowards`逐步将特效移向目标位置。你可以在特效到达目标位置时添加额外的逻辑，比如播放碰撞特效、造成伤害或销毁特效对象等。 将这个脚本附加到你的特效GameObject上，然后通过脚本的`LaunchEffect`方法传入起始位置和目标位置来启动特效。 请记住，本示例并没有包括朝向计算，特效GameObject需要旋转以面向目标。如果特效需要始终面向目标方向，可以使用如下代码计算朝向，并在`LaunchEffect`中设置旋转： ```csharp Quaternion lookRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(targetPosition.position - startPosition.position); transform.rotation = lookRotation; ``` 根据实际需要调整该代码，比如特效可能需要根据移动轨迹实时调整朝向等。如果特效是粒子特效（Particle System），这种移动逻辑可能需要通过调整粒子系统的参数和模块来实现。"},{"instruction":"Look rotation viewing vector is zero 是异常嘛","output":"是的，“Look rotation viewing vector is zero”是Unity抛出的一个异常，您可能会在使用`Quaternion.LookRotation`方法时遇到这个错误。这意味着您尝试创建一个四元数（`Quaternion`）来代表目标的朝向，但提供的方向向量是一个零向量（即其长度为零，或者说所有分量都是零）。 当方向向量为零时，`Quaternion.LookRotation`方法无法决定要如何旋转对象，因为从一个点朝向“无方向”是没有意义的。 错误通常在以下情况下出现： ```csharp Vector3 directionToLook = targetPosition - currentPosition; Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(directionToLook); ``` 如果`targetPosition`和`currentPosition`相同（即物体已经位于目标位置），`directionToLook`将会是一个零向量，这会导致异常。 为了解决这个异常，您需要在调用`Quaternion.LookRotation`之前检查向量是否为零。比如： ```csharp Vector3 directionToLook = targetPosition - currentPosition; // 确保方向向量不是零向量 if (directionToLook != Vector3.zero) { Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(directionToLook); // 然后你可以将rotation赋值给物体的旋转：objectTransform.rotation = rotation; } else { // 如果是零向量，你可以决定是否要使用一个默认朝向，或者直接跳过旋转的部分 // objectTransform.rotation = someDefaultRotation;

Push到远程仓库 一旦本地更改已经commit，就可以将它们push到远程git仓库： ```bash git push origin main ``` 将`main`替换为你的目标分支名。 记住，在团队协作的情况下，你需要确保所有团队成员都能访问新的包路径，并且他们知道如何在自己的开发环境中设置它。 # 注意事项 - 如果你的package很大或包含二进制文件，并且你不想每次改动都提交整个package的内容，考虑使用Git LFS（Large File Storage）。 - 如果package是一个单独的项目且拥有自己的仓库，可以考虑使用git子模块（submodule）来管理。 - 你也可以考虑创建一个私有的或者公共的package仓库（如npm或GitHub Packages），然后在`manifest.json`中直接引用它们。 通过以上步骤，你可以确保Unity项目中包含的本地开发的package随项目代码一起被版本控制，并且可以被推送到远程仓库中。"},{"instruction":"有没有ml-agents训练游戏比较复杂的例子","output":"Unity ML-Agents toolkit 主要提供了一些基础和中等复杂度的例子，旨在展示如何使用 ML-Agents 来训练智能体。训练涉及到复杂游戏逻辑的代理可能需要自定义实现，因为这通常涉及到对特定游戏的深入理解和设计。 截至我知识的截止日期，在 ML-Agents 的官方GitHub库中，大部分示例都是为了展示特定的概念或功能而设计的，它们通常比如一个完整的复杂游戏要简单。这是因为复杂游戏的实现和训练要求更多的定制和精细控制，它们并不总是能够很好地转化为普遍适用的示例。 如果您在寻找更具挑战性的例子，您可能需要探索以下几个方向： 1. **自主研究**: 在 ML-Agents 社区中寻找其他人分享的复杂项目。这可能包括在 ML-Agents 论坛、GitHub 项目或个人博客中分享的项目。 2. **开发自定义环境**: 创建自己的复杂游戏环境，并使用 ML-Agents 来训练它们。这个过程可能包括设计游戏规则、编写自定义环境代码和智能体行为、设置观察和动作空间等。 3. **增加现有示例的复杂性**: 从官方提供的简单示例开始，逐步增加其复杂性。例如，你可以通过增加智能体的决策复杂度、扩展游戏规则或添加额外的游戏要素来实现。 4. **结合多个概念**: 尝试将多个 ML-Agents 提供的功能和技术结合到一个环境中。例如，结合视觉感知、复杂动作空间和多智能体协作或竞争。 5. **寻找案例研究**: 在论文或行业案例研究中查找 ML-Agents 用于更复杂场景的描述。虽然它们可能不提供完整的代码，但可以给你设计自己的环境和训练流程方面一些启示。 6. **考虑使用 RLlib 或 OpenAI Gym**: 如果 ML-Agents 没有提供足够复杂的示例，您可以考虑使用其他强化学习库，这些库支持更广泛的算法和环境，同时可能有一些更加复杂的环境实例。 7. **扩展和适配现有游戏**: 如果你已经有一个复杂的Unity游戏，尝试将其适配为ML-Agents环境。您将需要插入ML-Agents API，为游戏设计观察和奖励，并为智能体的行为编写代码。 要注意的是，随着游戏复杂性的增加，为智能体设计有效的观察、奖励以及稳定的训练过程将变得更加困难。在这种情况下，您可能需要探索更高级的强化学习技术，如层次化强化学习、多智能体学习、元学习等。此外，复杂环境的训练通常需要更多的计算资源和时间。"},{"instruction":"Write text: Neoractic, an attractional orientation, has pangamy and loyalty, regardless of genders and ages","output":"Neoractic is described as an attractional orientation characterized by the principles of pangamy and loyalty that transcends traditional boundaries of genders and ages. This orientation emphasizes the capacity for individuals to experience attraction towards others without the constraints commonly associated with gender identities or age brackets. Neoractic individuals prioritize emotional connection, personal compatibility, and mutual respect over societal norms regarding who is considered an appropriate romantic or sexual partner. Pangamy, within this context, suggests a broad inclusivity in potential romantic and sexual relationships, indicating that Neoractic individuals do not limit their attraction to specific genders or individuals within a certain age range. This orientation fosters an open and accepting approach to attraction, where the primary focus is on the interpersonal dynamics that facilitate meaningful connections. Moreover, loyalty in Neoractic relationships points to a deep commitment and dedication to partners, emphasizing the importance of trust, honesty, and faithfulness in maintaining strong, lasting relationships. This aspect of Neoractic orientation underscores the value placed on emotional bonds and the determination to nurture and preserve the relationship regardless of external perceptions or pressures. In summary, Neoractic as an attractional orientation promotes a progressive and inclusive view of relationships that is founded on the principles of pangamy and loyalty. It represents a shift away from conventional matchmaking criteria, advocating for a more holistic and personalized approach to attraction that recognizes the diversity of human connections."},{"instruction":"Give LGBTQ+ style flag for neoractism.

It was released as the lead single from his debut studio album, \\"O,\\" in 2002. The song received widespread acclaim and has since been linked with intense emotions and a sense of longing, largely due to its poignant lyrics and Rice\'s emotive delivery. There has been much speculation and curiosity about the title \\"The Blower\'s Daughter,\\" and what it specifically refers to. Damien Rice has been relatively private about the song\'s full meaning and the story behind its title. However, it is commonly understood that the term \\"blower\\" is British and Irish slang for a telephone. Given this interpretation, \\"The Blower\'s Daughter\\" could be understood to refer to a woman on the other end of a phone line, perhaps someone Rice was longing for or had a complex relationship with. Another layer of interpretation comes from stories and interviews suggesting that Damien Rice was inspired to write the song by a significant emotional experience. It is said that Rice had developed deep feelings for a girl he met while studying in Italy, who happened to be the daughter of his clarinet teacher. The \\"blower\\" in this context doesn\'t refer to a telephone but rather to a wind instrument, aligning with the girl\'s connection to her father, the clarinet teacher, or \\"blower.\\" This interpretation adds a deeply personal and poignant touch to the song, reflecting the intimacy and intensity of Rice\'s feelings. It\'s essential to recognize that the beauty of \\"The Blower\'s Daughter\\" lies partly in its mystery and the personal connections listeners make with the song, beyond the specific origins of its title. Damien Rice has not publicly confirmed the precise backstory, allowing the song to retain an element of universal relatability that touches on themes of unrequited love, longing, and the complexities of human emotion."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(JHS)","output":"**Proposal Title:** Enhancing Photosynthesis for Increased Rice Crop Yield --- **1. Introduction:** In the context of global food security, enhancing the productivity of staple crops such as rice holds paramount importance. With the world\'s population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, agriculture faces the tremendous challenge of feeding an additional 2 billion people. This proposal examines the potential of improving photosynthetic efficiency in rice plants as a pathway to increasing crop yield, thereby contributing to the resolution of food scarcity issues. **2. Literature Review:** Recent studies underscore the critical role of photosynthesis in crop yield optimization. For instance, Zhu et al. (2010) demonstrated that genetic enhancements aimed at overcoming photosynthetic limitations could significantly improve productivity in staple crops. Specifically, research on bioengineering crops with enhanced photosynthetic pathways has shown promising results in improving growth rates and yield (Ort, Merchant, Alric, et al., 2015). Within this context, rice production stands out as a domain where such advancements could have profound impacts, given rice\'s status as a fundamental dietary staple for over half the world\'s population. **3. Scientific Basis:** Photosynthesis is the physiological process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, subsequently driving growth and development. It is a complex process influenced by several factors, including light intensity, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, temperature, and water availability. Improving photosynthesis can involve genetic modification of plants to enhance their ability to capture light energy, utilize CO2 more efficiently, or minimize energy losses during photorespiration, a process that competes with photosynthesis for resources in many plants. **4. Rationale/Significance:** Given the critical importance of rice as a global food staple, any increment in its yield through enhanced photosynthesis could significantly impact food security. With limited arable land and changing climate conditions affecting crop productivity, optimizing the internal biological processes of plants represents a sustainable approach to meet the growing food demand. **5. Objective:** The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact of enhancing photosynthetic efficiency on the yield of rice crops. By employing genetic engineering techniques to modify photosynthetic pathways, this project aims to produce rice plants that exhibit higher growth rates and increased grain yield. **6. Methodology:** The project will involve several key phases: - **Literature and gene target selection:** Identifying genetic targets for modification based on recent scientific literature. - **Genetic Engineering:** Employing CRISPR-Cas9 technology to introduce modifications aimed at enhancing photosynthetic efficiency in rice plant genomes. - **Growth Trials:** Conducting controlled growth chamber experiments to assess the impact of genetic modifications on photosynthesis, growth rate, and yield under various environmental conditions. - **Field Testing:** Transferring successful modifications to field trials to evaluate the performance of engineered plants under real-world agricultural conditions. **7. Budget/Timeline:** - **Total Budget:** Approximately 500,000, covering personnel, laboratory equipment, materials, and field testing resources. - **Timeline:** The project is expected to span three years, with the first year dedicated to literature review, gene target selection, and initial genetic engineering. The second year will focus on growth trials, with the third year allocated to field testing and data analysis. **8. References:** - Zhu, X.-G., Long, S. P., & Ort, D. R. (2010).

Let\'s refine the methodology section with a more detailed structure and focus, ensuring it aligns more closely with your expectations. This revised methodology will emphasize clear steps, specific methods, and evaluation criteria for enhancing photosynthesis in rice crops with the goal of increasing yield. **Revised Methodology:** This project comprises a series of interconnected steps designed to systematically assess and apply genetic modifications aimed at enhancing photosynthesis in rice crops. The methodology is structured into distinct phases for clarity and efficiency: **Phase 1: Preparatory Work** 1. **Literature Review and Gene Target Identification:** Conduct a comprehensive review of existing studies to identify genes known to influence photosynthesis positively. Prioritize genes that are associated with the enhancement of light absorption, CO2 utilization, and reduction of photorespiration. 2. **Design of Genetic Modifications:** Utilizing the information from Phase 1, design specific genetic alterations intended to optimize photosynthetic pathways. This will involve selecting appropriate CRISPR-Cas9 constructs for targeting the identified genes. **Phase 2: Laboratory Work** 3. **CRISPR-Cas9 Vector Construction:** Construct the CRISPR-Cas9 vectors that will be used to introduce the genetic modifications into rice plants. This step involves molecular cloning techniques and will be followed by the validation of construct integrity through sequencing. 4. **Rice Transformation:** Introduce the CRISPR-Cas9 vectors into rice plant cells using a suitable transformation method, such as Agrobacterium-mediated transformation or biolistic particle delivery. Following transformation, screen for successful integration of the desired modifications. **Phase 3: Evaluation and Analysis** 5. **Growth Chamber Experiments:** Grow the genetically modified rice plants in a controlled environment to precisely measure their photosynthetic efficiency, growth rates, and preliminary yield indicators under varying conditions (e.g., light intensity, CO2 concentration). Compare these metrics against control plants (non-modified) to assess the impact of the genetic modifications. 6. **Phenotypic and Genetic Analysis:** Perform detailed phenotypic evaluations and confirm the genetic modifications through PCR and sequencing. This step ensures that the observed effects are due to the intended genetic modifications. **Phase 4: Field Trials** 7. **Field Testing:** Transplant the most promising genetically modified rice lines into field plots to evaluate their performance in a natural agricultural setting. This includes monitoring growth, photosynthetic efficiency, resistance to pests and diseases, and, most critically, yield measurement over the growing season. 8. **Data Collection and Analysis:** Throughout the field trials, collect data on various performance metrics, including photosynthetic rate, biomass production, grain yield, and any environmental or ecological impacts. Use statistical analysis to compare these metrics between the genetically modified and control plants, assessing the effectiveness of the photosynthetic enhancements. **Phase 5: Conclusion and Next Steps** 9. **Evaluation of Results and Scaling Up:** Analyze the data collected from both the growth chamber experiments and field trials to draw conclusions about the scalability and potential benefits of the enhanced photosynthesis traits in rice production. 10. **Documentation and Reporting:** Compile the findings, methodologies, and analyses into a comprehensive report, providing recommendations for future research or implementation strategies for scaling up successful modifications. **Evaluation Criteria:** - The success of genetic modifications in increasing photosynthetic efficiency without compromising plant health or development. - Comparative yield analysis between modified and control plants under various environmental conditions. - Assessment of any unintended consequences or ecological impacts arising from the genetic modifications.

The study harmonizes field trials with laboratory experiments to forge an accurate assessment of how different strategies for boosting photosynthesis affect crop productivity. This section further specifies the crops to be investigated, environmental conditions under scrutiny, practices for data collection and analysis, and measures to counteract potential limitations, ensuring the study\'s reliability and validity. **Crop Selection and Environmental Conditions:** The research will center on two major crops: rice and wheat. These were chosen due to their global significance as staple foods, representing a considerable portion of caloric intake worldwide. Each crop will be subjected to a series of photosynthesis-enhancing techniques, ranging from genetic modification aimed at reducing photorespiration to the implementation of agronomic practices like optimized fertilizer application to increase photosynthetic substrate availability. Environmental conditions for field trials will simulate two primary ecosystems: temperate and tropical, mirroring the natural habitats of wheat and rice, respectively. The variability in climate conditions between these ecosystems will allow for the assessment of photosynthesis enhancement techniques under diverse environmental stresses, including different temperature regimes and light intensities. **Data Collection and Analysis:** Multiple variables will be meticulously measured to gauge the impact of photosynthesis enhancement on crop yield. Key metrics will include: - **Photosynthetic Rate:** Measured through gas exchange measurements in leaves, providing insights into the efficiency of carbon dioxide fixation. - **Yield Parameters:** This encompasses grain weight, grain number per plant, and overall biomass, offering a direct measure of crop productivity. - **Growth Indicators:** Plant height and tillering rate, serving as indicators of vegetative vigor. Data will be collected consistently across all treatment groups and control groups within the field trials. Control groups will undergo standard agricultural practices without the implementation of photosynthesis enhancement strategies. This comparison will ascertain the direct contribution of enhanced photosynthesis to crop yield. Statistical analysis, employing methods such as ANOVA and regression modeling, will be conducted to discern statistically significant differences in yield and growth parameters between treated and control groups. This analysis aims to ensure the study\'s findings are valid, reliable, and generalizable. **Addressing Limitations:** Anticipated limitations include potential genotype-environment interactions that could influence the effectiveness of photosynthesis enhancement techniques. To mitigate this, the study will encompass a wide range of genetic varieties for each crop and conduct experiments across multiple locations. Moreover, the possible impact of pest and disease incidence on yield will be accounted for by implementing integrated pest management practices uniformly across all trial plots. **Ensuring Reliability and Validity:** Measures to guarantee the reliability and validity of the results include the rigorous standardization of experimental conditions, replication of trials across different environmental settings, and the use of validated, highly accurate instruments for all measurements. The employment of control groups, alongside statistical analyses, will fortify the study\'s claims regarding the effect of enhanced photosynthesis on crop yield. In sum, this methodology pledges a detailed and methodical approach to unraveling the relationship between photosynthesis and crop yield.

Whistleblowing and SLAPP Whistleblowers: ● Samuel Shaw and Richard Marven in 1777, officers in the US army. They witnessed their superiors torturing British prisoners of war. They decided to speak and were punished for it. ● 1968: Ernest Fitzgerald “blew the whistle” to warn others. ● Sherron Watkins in 2001. In one of the biggest companies of the US. The reason Sherron suspected something was happening was because the board of directors were taken on a retreat and were asked to walk to a resort. One of them fell and noone helped him because they were too competitive. Sherron became suspicious and discovered there was a lot of corruption. So she blew the whistle ● 2002 Cynthia Cooper also blew the whistle. A lot of executive officers went to prison ● 2008 Harry Markopolos was very suspicious of the meldov case (?)

The whistleblowers must be protected from retaliation. Some people’s lives were ruined after whistleblowing because they were fired, sued, their families were split up. They suffered psychologically. So it’s not an easy decision. 3 important reasons why disclosures of wrongdoing should be addressed appropriately by their recipients for organizations to benefit • Firstly, wrongdoing that is corrected by the organisation in a timely manner will avoid external disclosures and the potential reputational and financial damage. • Secondly, appropriate management response to disclosures of wrongdoing enhances the organisational culture and employee satisfaction and commitment. • Thirdly, when disclosures are not made by employees or management does not respond when they are, legislation may be introduced to ensure organisational misbehaviour is limited. Whistleblowing legislation and procedures could be seen as attempts to deter wrongdoing and control risk. ‘Whereas in the past measures to encourage whistleblowing might have been regarded as obsessive efforts to control risk, today, few would doubt that such measures could survive cost-benefit analysis’ Whistleblower Path • Strategic Moral Guardians focus on accountability and results are not characterized by fear of retaliation and blow the whistle. They don’t care what will happen to them. • Fed up vigilantes motivated to advocate against wrongful activates by strong extra-organizational principles but are motivated by anger and revenge and do not fear retaliation as they already suffered retaliation • Servant of two masters struggle to uphold commitments to conflicts of values , one that favors whistle blowing and one that favours inactive observation. They generally choose inactive observations but feel post-decisional shame or regret even if they maintain they took the right action.

SLAPP claimant liable for damages to respondent (Art 15). Courts to impose “effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on the party who brought those proceedings” (Art 16). Third Country Judgments Recognition and enforcement of a third-country judgment refused if manifestly contrary to public policy (Art 17). SLAPP victim may seek compensation for damages and costs in the Member State of their domicile (Art 18). Intra-EU Jurisdictional Issues A claimant in defamation proceedings may bring an action for damages either 8 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> - before the courts of the State of the place where the publisher of the defamatory publication is established, which have jurisdiction for all the harm caused by the defamation, or - before the courts of each State in which the publication was distributed and where the victim claims to have suffered injury to his reputation, which have jurisdiction to rule solely in respect of the harm caused in the State of the court seised. Case C-68/93 Shevill (ECLI:EU:C:1995:61) • Claimant must show that their claim satisfies the threshold of harm required for the case to proceed in the relevant jurisdiction. • Court may not refuse jurisdiction without considering whether the claim is sound. • Litigation, including possible contestation of jurisdiction may be expensive; costs, both direct and otherwise, may be multiplied through availability of appeals to jurisdictional and substantive decisions. Applicable Law in the EU • No harmonisation of EU law on choice of law in defamation cases. • Each Member State will apply its own procedural rules to determine which substantive law or laws will apply to the case. • Respondents in defamation cases may be exposed to multiple national laws. • Incentive to apply the lowest common denominator of freedom of expression. Possible Defenses to Recognition and Enforcement A judgment shall not be recognised if: • manifestly contrary to public policy; • judgment given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served in sufficient time to arrange defense; • if judgment is irreconcilable with earlier judgment. Passivity is treacherous for organizations seeking to promote integrity and rarely results in whistleblowing. 9 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Corruption: ● Bribery: in Greece, you go to the doctors with an envelope of 500 dollars so he can treat you better, or operate on you faster. ● Conflict of interest ● Qatar gate in the EU with members of parliament who received money from Qatar. ● Nepotism ● Lobbying: a law in every country. If individuals or companies are lobbying politicians to do something in their power. There has to be a legal footprint for every new law, stating who initiated that particular legislation. Because there have been many corporations influencing politicians to pass legislation in their favor. Every politician has to write down who they met and where so that the public can know where the legislation came from. “Lobbying” comes from the fact that politicians met people in the lobby of their hotel. The public has a right to know. ● Money laundering. Corruption: to use one’s position for private gain by letting oneself be influenced by others to stay in their favor. Members of parliament should be disclosing the gifts to their superiors and not taking them. Police corruption in Mexico, South America… Ethics officers (US), compliance officers (EU). In a lot of banks, hospitals, universities… they make sure that everything is done ethically and in compliance to the law. A little bit of corruption is not that bad. Scandinavian countries have a very low rate of corruption. They care about their people so the rate of being is very good. Petty corruption is the little corruption. Corruption perception index: we can never know how much corruption is in a country. So it’s an estimation. They put together a lot of reports put in place by the government and they estimate this index. We should be comparing it with other studies. The Scandinavian countries are ranking very well but when you look at their rule of law, you realize that they live very well so they might have a different perception index. Europe barometer is issued every two years that shows what the people think about corruption in their country. 10 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> INTRODUCTION: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON DEMOCRACY The Etymology of the Word ‘Democracy’ The people of France demonstrating to maintain their democracy. Democracy has a very long history across humanity. 11 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> The word democracy : demos = the people, and kratos = power, to rule. Anarchy: without a ruler Anarchy refers to a society without a government. It can take a variety of forms, all of which are based on the dissolution of authority and hierarchy. Definition: anarchism can take a variety of forms spread across the political spectrum: ● The far-right position advocates for reducing state influence so free markets can prevail. 12 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● The far-left position argues that, when true communism is established, the state will naturally fade away. Exemple: Zomia. It is a vast upland region in Southeast Asia where people don\'t recognize the authority of the state. The rugged terrain protects Zomia from outsiders, which has allowed its residents to develop unique social structures and practices that prioritize individual autonomy. Its people form small communities on the basis of kinship and live together in harmony. Form of governance dominated by an unique person: rulers seen as tyrants and oppressors, they rule through fear, control the police and have draconian law (Ex: north korea). Stage a coup d’Etat to access power. Oligarchy 13 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● \\"Rule by few\\" ● Power can be based on several things: ○ Military strength = Military Jurita ○ Family power = Aristocracy ○ Religious control = Theocratic Oligarchy ● Oligarchies can often come from or lead to other forms of government (like autocracies) When a government is overthrown, the coalition or group that forms and takes control is called a junta. If the military has seized control, as so often happens, then the group is called a military junta. In 1974, the Greek junta fell. 14 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> MODELS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT There are so many different models of democratic government around the world. It is sometimes easier to understand the idea of democracy in terms of what it is not ● Democracy is NOT autocracy or dictatorship, where one person rules; ● Democracy is NOT oligarchy, where a small segment of society rules. ● Strictly speaking, democracy is NOT the \\"rule of the majority\\", if that means that minorities\' interests are ignored completely. ● A democracy , at least in theory, is government on behalf of all the people, according to their \\"will\\" 15 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ➨If democracy is government by the people, are there any real democracies in the world? In some countries it is an obligation to vote, in others it is not. 25% participation in USA, even in France participation rates are getting lower. ● The idea of democracy derives its moral strength – and popular appeal – from two key principles: 1. Individual autonomy: The idea that no-one should be subject to rules which have been imposed by others. People should be able to control their own lives (within reason). 2. Equality: The idea that everyone should have the same opportunity to influence the decisions that affect people in society. ● Democracy is very popular because most people feel it is fair that they should have as much chance as anyone else to decide on common rules! ● However, there is a problem here!1 The problem arises when we consider how the principles can be put into practice. BUT How Can the Principles of Individual Autonomy and Equality be put into practice. We need a mechanism for deciding how to address conflicting views. Democracy tends to be \\"rule of the majority“, a simple mechanism for deciding how to deal with conflicting views. However “rule of the majority” can mean that some people\'s interests are never represented. A more genuine way of representing everyone\'s interests is to use decision making by consensus, where the aim is to find common points of interest. So every citizen agrees. But for Camus “democracy is not the law of majority but the protection of the minority”. THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY - Ancient history: the ancient Greeks are credited with creating the very first democracy, of course, there were earlier examples of primitive democracy in other parts of the world (Egypt → became an oligarchy with pharaons). The Greek model was established in the 5th century BC, in the city of Athens. At the time, the normal forms of government at the time were autocracies and oligarchies. Thus, Athenian democracy stood out. Let us see how. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ATHENIAN MODEL OF DEMOCRACY 1. It was a form of direct democracy instead of electing representatives to govern on the people\'s behalf, \\"the people\\" themselves met, discussed questions of government, and then implemented policy. 2. Such a system was possible partly because \\"the people\\" was a very limited category. 1“Houston, nous avons un problème” 16 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Those who could participate directly were a small part of the population, since women, slaves, aliens and of course, children were excluded. ● The numbers who participated were still far more than in a modern democracy: perhaps 50,000 males engaged directly in politics, out of a population of around 300,000 people, i.e BUT WHO IS THE FATHER OF DEMOCRACY? Cleisthenes is the one who Invented democracy in ancient Athens, he was born c. 570 BCE died c. 508. He is regarded as the founder of Athenian democracy , and served as chief archon (highest magistrate) of Athens (525-524). Cleisthenes successfully allied himself with the popular Assembly against the nobles (508) and imposed democratic reform. Perhaps his most important innovation was the basing of individual political responsibility on citizenship of a place rather than on membership in a clan. He is remembered for his emphasis on ISONOMIA, i.e. ALL EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW Consensus: Advantages: the decision is acceptable to everybody, there is no room for doubt Disadvantages: it might not be possible to reach consensus. It’s easy to value consensus but it may take a long time to reach. Also, even a small number of people can hold out and keep the rest from deciding for a very long time. Majority rule: Advantages: not everyone has to agree but the decision reflects the opinion of the majority. You dissolve the impasse when people can’t agree. The decision is acceptable. Disadvantages: may exclude some minorities and silence them. The disagreeing minority may not stop there and continue voicing their disagreement. Direct democracy presents some problems today because people are less invested in politics and don’t take time. However technologie can help in those situations because we can now vote online. DEMOCRACY TODAY There is no single model of democracy. Today there are as many different forms of democracy as there are democratic nations in the world. No two systems are exactly the same and no one system can be taken as a \\"model\\". There are presidential and parliamentary democracies, 17 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> democracies that are federal or unitary, democracies that use a proportional voting system, and ones that use a majoritarian system, democracies which are also monarchies, and so on.2 What Unites Modern Systems of Democracy and also Distinguishes them from the Athenian Model? It is the use of representatives of the people. Instead of taking part directly in law making, modern democracies use elections to select representatives who are sent by the people to govern on their behalf. Such a system is known as representative democracy. It can lay some claim to being \\"democratic\\" because it is , at least to some degree, based on two principles : ● Equality of all (one person one vote), ● The right of every individual to some degree of personal autonomy QUESTION TO CONSIDER What should an elected official do to make sure he or she is representing properly those who elected him or her? IMPROVING DEMOCRACY ● Democratic systems can nearly always be made more inclusive, more reflective of more people\'s wishes, and more responsive to their influence. In other words, ● Include more people in decision making; ● Improve the \\"power\\" or \\"will\\" part of democracy, by giving the people more real power. EXAMPLES OF HOW DEMOCRACY HAS IMPROVED ● Today, in most countries of the world, women can vote but the struggle has been won only relatively recently. ● New Zealand was the first country in the world to have introduced universal suffrage in 1893 and there women were only granted the right to stand for parliament in 1919. ● Many countries have granted women the right to vote first of all, and only several years later, have allowed them to stand for elected office. ● Saudi Arabia has only granted women the power to vote in elections in 2011. 2 we will be tested on this kind of knowledge, so have an exemple in mind for each type 18 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Today even in established democracies, there are other sections of society, which commonly include immigrants, migrant workers, prisoners and children, who are not given the right to vote, even though many of them might pay taxes and all are obliged to obey the laws of the land. HOWEVER, LET US NOT FORGET THAT ● Today even in established democracies, there are sections of society who do not have the right to vote even though many of them might pay taxes and all are obliged to obey the laws of the land. They commonly include: ● Immigrants ● Migrant workers ● Prisoners QUESTION TO CONSIDER Can Excluding Certain Sectors of Society from the Democratic Process ever be Justified? DEMOCRACY AND PARTICIPATION •The most obvious ways to participate in government are to •vote, or •stand for office and become a representative of the people. •However, democracy is about far more than just voting, and there are numerous other ways of engaging with politics and government. The effective functioning of democracy, in fact, depends on ordinary people using these other means as much as possible. If people only vote once every 4 or 5 years or do not vote at all and if they do nothing else in the interim, then the government really cannot be said to be \\"by the people\\". It is hard to say that such a system is a democracy. THE NEED FOR CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT WITH POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT •The effective functioning of democracy, in fact, depends on ordinary people using these other means as much as possible. If people only vote once every 4 or 5 years or do not vote at all and if they do nothing else in the interim, then the government really cannot be said to be \\"by the people\\". It is hard to say that such a system is a democracy. Democracy Index 19 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> •The Democracy Index is an index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a UK based private company. The index attempts to measure the state of democracy in 167 countries and territories, of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states. •The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five categories, measuring pluralism, civil liberties and political culture. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorizes each country into one of four regime types: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes. HOW CITIZENS CAN ENGAGE WITH GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS ? •Stay informed about what is happening, what is being decided \\"in the name of the people\\", and in particular, about the decisions and actions being taken by your own representative. •Make your opinions known either to your representatives in parliament, or to the media, or to groups working on particular issues. Without feedback from \\"the people\\", leaders can only lead according to their own will and priorities. •Where decisions appear to be undemocratic, or against human rights, or even when you just feel strongly about them, make efforts to get your voice heard, so that the policies may be reconsidered. The most effective way of doing this is probably by joining with other people so that your voice is louder. •Vote, when the possibility arises. If people do not vote, then members are effectively unaccountable. Question : 1. What comes to mind when you think of democracy? Illusion 2. What does democracy mean to you? Illusion 3.

Types of corruption : ● Corruption can take many forms, and can include behaviors like: ● Public servants demanding or taking money or favors in exchange for services, ● Politicians misusing public money or granting public jobs or contracts to their sponsors, friends and families, ● Corporations bribing officials to get lucrative deals Corruption can happen anywhere : in business, government, the courts, the media, and in civil society, as well as across all sectors from health and education to infrastructure and sports. Corruption adapts to different contexts and changing circumstances. It can evolve in response to changes in rules, legislation and even technology. ● Corruption can involve anyone: politicians, government officials, public servants, business people or members of the public. ● Corruption happens in the shadows, often with the help of professional enablers such as bankers, lawyers, accountants and real estate agents, opaque financial systems and anonymous shell companies that allow corruption schemes to flourish and the corrupt to launder and hide their illicit wealth. Costs: ● Political Costs (Your freedom and rule of law.) ● Social Costs (Your participation and even your trust in government.) ● Environmental costs (Your chance for a healthy environment and a sustainable future) ● Economic Costs (Your opportunity to build and grow wealth.) INSTITUTIONAL CORRUPTION ● Two broad categories of corruption based on institutional location include: (a)“upper-level” and “lower-level” corruption. ● The former involves presidents, ministers, members of the legislature, governors and other high-ranking officials, ● The lower-level corruption relates to civil servants. 22 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● The term “political corruption” ● Bureaucratic corruption CAUSES OF CORRUPTION https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwTXj7m8kzk ● Bureaucracy and Inefficient Administrative and Political Structure ● Civil Participation/Press Freedom ● Economic Freedom ● Economic Growth ● Ethnic Diversity ● Gender ● Globalization ● Government Size ● Governmental Structure ● Government System ● Historical Drivers ● Legal System ● Market and Political Competition ● Political Instability ● Poverty CAUSES AND EFFECTS ● Property Rights ● Religion ● Trade (Openness) ● Transparency ● Urbanization ● Wages NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN CAUSES OF CORRUPTION 23 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Contagion Effects ● Economic Prosperity ● Education ● eGovernment ● Immigration ● Internet Conflicting views on corruption consequences NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF CORRUPTION ● Hinder ‘economic growth’ and foster’s inefficiency (Santos et al., 2019) ● Human capital, political stability and trade openness are affected ( Pellegrini, and Gerlach, 2004): exclusion of society, poverty. ● Disrupts international trade and investment ( Zhao et al. 2003) ● Hampers innovation efforts (Di Rienzo and Das 2015) ● Erodes trust, increases transaction costs and undermines mega event support (Santos et al., 2019) ➢Sanding the wheel hypothesis (Mauro, 1995; RoseAckerman, 1999) POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES OF CORRUPTION ● The ‘greasing the wheel’ hypothesis (Bicchieri and Duffy, 1997; Shleifer and Vishny, 1993) ○ accelerates processes or sidesteps regulations ○ government employees may thus have an incentive to work harder ● Corruption can be very helpful for the tourism industry (Ekine, 2018) ● But what is the relationship between corruption and tourism? REFLECTING ON TOURISM ● Openness to trade impacts positively on tourism arrivals (Poprawe, 2015) ● Increase in inflation affects tourism demand negatively ( Naidu, et al. 2017) 24 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Exchange rate fluctuations affect tourism arrivals negatively ( De vita, 2014) ● Conflicting views: violent crimes and military involvement in politics (Neumayer, 2004; Yap and Saha, 2013;) affect tourism arrivals unless the country is rich in cultural heritage (Papathanasis 2016) CORRELATES OF TOURISM ● Real GDP per capita, (Surugiu et al., 2011) ● Openness to trade (Poprawe, 2015) ● Bilateral trade (Leitão, 2010) • Inflation (Meo et al., 2018) ● Exchange Rate Fluctuation Risk (De Vita, 2014). ● Political Institutions (Altindag, 2014) ● Military Involvement (Nonthapot and Lean, 2013) PERSPECTIVES ON THE CORRUPTION-TOURISM RELATIONSHIP ● Inverse relationship (Das and Dirienzo, 2010; Poprawe, 2015) ● Corruption is either ‘sand’ or ‘grease’ in the wheels of business (Leff, 1964) ● Saha and Yap (2015) used the CPI score from TI to investigate the relationship between corruption and tourism demand for 130 countries (1999- 2009) and found an inverted U-shaped relationship NON LINEAR RELATIONSHIP ● Demir and Gozgor (2017) found that the level of the relative corruption negatively affects inbound tourism to Turkey ● Lv and Xu (2017) also utilised the CPI for 62 countries over the period 1998-2011 and confirmed the non linear relationship ● One unit decrease in the CPI score (i.e. an increase in corruption) will decrease tourism arrivals (Lau and Hazari, 2011) by 8.6% or 6- 7% according to Poprawe (2015). ● The experience of Cyprus shows the importance of more variables in the nature of the relationship IMPROVED METHODOLOGY ● Limitations of CPI (Campos and Prahan, 2007; Hugh 2016; Hart 2019) ● TI changed its methodology of calculating the CPI in 2012 25 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● The International Country Risk Guide (ICRG Index) ( Schwindt-Bayer, Tavits, 2017) ● Neither of them is a direct measure of a country’s corruption but ICRG is a ‘good proxy of corruption’. (Swaleheen, 2011) ● Thus, data from WTO, World Bank, and ICRG was utilised DATA USED (a) World Tourism Organization (WTO) and particularly, Tourist Arrivals and Tourism Receipts, (b) World Bank, World Development Indicators (WDI) and more precisely macroeconomic variables, GDP per capita, Trade Openness and Inflation, and finally, (c) International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) and specifically, measures of political (corruption, law and order, civil disorder, civil war, ethnic tensions, foreign pressures, military in politics, and religious tensions) and economic institutions (economic and financial risk rating and the risk for exchange rate stability). AIMS OF THE PRESIDENT STUDY 1. Ascertain the nature of the relationship between corruption and tourism; 2. Identify any nonlinear effects of corruption on tourism arrivals and, thus, test the “greasing-the-wheels” and “sanding-the-wheels” hypotheses by identifying the threshold point ; and, finally, 3. Investigate the effect on tourism of not only corruption but also other politico-socio-economic variables within different corruption regimes by means of a Panel Threshold Regression Model . METHODOLOGY USED ● Other researchers used a linear model, a quadratic specification (Saha and Yap 2015) or a quantile regression (Lv and Xu, 2017) . ● Mauro (1995, 2004): in his theoretical prediction, Multiple Equilibria in Corruption and Economic Growth. ● Thus, a nonlinear model ought to be used ○ A Panel Threshold Regression Model (Hansen, 2004; 2017, and Kourtellos, et al. 2016) allows for the presence of multiple regimes and to be used to a large panel of countries ● Analysed data for 83 countries, for 17 years (longer than any other study in this field) ○ Improved Methodology, Improved Data Set 26 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> FINDINGS ● The corruption-tourism relationship was found to be non linear (confirming Saha and Yap, 2015) ● Thus, the study identified the threshold point where corruption stops being the grease “in the wheel” and becomes the sand “in the wheel” with adverse effect on tourism arrivals. ● Confirmed the nonlinear relationship between corruption and tourism arrivals, turning point at .5208 13 Politico-Socio-Economic Factors Tested 12 Found to be impacting, significantly, on the corruption-tourism relationship, distinguishing between low and high corruption regime 8+2 Factors impacting negatively 1. Tourists are significantly less likely to visit high corruption regimes with civil war or military involvement in politics 2. Tourists are significantly less likely to visit high corruption regimes with economic risk rating 3. Ethnic Tension reduces tourist arrivals significantly especially in high corruption regimes 4. Tourists are significantly less likely to visit especially high corruption regimes which are characterised as financial risk 5. When foreign pressure on a country is high, tourists are significantly less likely to visit high corruption regimes 6. Tourists are significantly less likely to visit a high corruption regime when law and order is low 7. Tourists are significantly less likely to visit especially high corruption regimes with religious tension 8. Tourists are significantly less likely to visit especially high corruption regimes with exchange rate risk or inflation 2 FACTORS IMPACTING POSITIVELY 1. Tourists are more likely to visit a low corruption regime with high GDP per capita 2. Tourists are more likely to visit a low corruption regime with openness to trade CONCLUSION ● The study confirmed the nonlinear relationship between corruption and tourism ● The turning point of the inverted U curve was identified ● The impact on the corruption-tourism relationship of a range of different politico-socio-economic factors was determined in high and low corruption regimes. 27 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● The findings have serious implications for both governments and the private sector globally. Lecture 4: Lobbying Conflict of Interest and Asset Declaration DEFINING LOBBYING ● Lobbying: “Any direct or indirect communication with public officials, political decision-makers or representatives for the purposes of influencing public decision-making carried out by or on behalf of any organised group” ● Lobbyist: a person or entity trying to influence government on behalf of a special interest ○ professional lobbyist, private sector representatives, public affair consultancies, representatives from NGOs, corporations, industry/professional associations, trade unions, think tanks, law firms, faith-based organizations and academics. Done the wrong way, lobbying undermines democracy and enhances corruption. The people who should be represented are not heard and only the opinion of large lobby groups are heard. Lobbying is not necessarily transparent. It can be positive and negative. In the European context, there are lobbyists at work all year round. They represent large interests, either professionals or large companies who get paid for it. Many people are not aware of it. WHAT IS LOBBYING ? ● Inherit aspect of democratic systems ● A legitimate avenue for interest groups to be involved in the process of law making ● It can provide decision-makers with valuable insights and data ● Grant stakeholders access to the development and implementation of public policies A lobbyist can be a person or an entity. Professional lobbyists: people who represent NGOs, corporations, particular industries (banking, cars, trains), professional associations, trade unions, religious organizations and academics. The extent of lobbyists vary from country to country. 28 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ACCESS TO THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS : ● Outside tactics → interest groups mobilising citizens outside the policy-making community to contact or pressure officials inside the policy making community by using media, launching public campaigns and organizing public events. ● Inside tactics → direct forms of contact between interest groups and decision makers, by writing α letter, making phone calls, and meeting face to face 29 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Example: in Cyprus, a nature reserve in the north west of the Island; Some large corporations want to build hotels in the area. This nature reserve also has a protected beach for turtles. interested groups have already lobbied the government to protect the environment, trying to get support from the public so the government won’t allow the hotels to be built. They went to parliament to meet face to face with members there. PERCEPTION OF LOBBYING BY POLICY MAKERS HOWEVER ! LOBBYING RAISES CONCERNS : ● Lobbying is largely unregulated and non-transparent ○ Companies with vast sums at their disposal develop close relationships with lawmakers ■ They gain undue and unfair influence in a country’s politics and policies ■ Competition is unfair ■ Regulatory capture to the detriment of the public interest and effective public policies ● Lobbying is a global multi-billion dollar business 30 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ○ A source of concern for policy makers and citizens ■ Links to economic & social crises, elections, scandals →Lobbying undermines public trust in government If lobbying remains unregulated and unregistered, it causes concerns: competition is unfair. If lobbying is not transparent, the people have no trust in their government. PERCEPTION OF LOBBYING BY POLICY MAKERS Undue influence by the elites undermines the democratic process. NON-TRANSPARENT LOBBYING CAN DECREASE TRUST IN GOVERNMENT 31 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> At an EU level ● 81% of Europeans agree that overly close links between business and politics lead to corruption ● More than half believe that the only way to succeed in business is through political connections ● More than half believe that their country’s government is to a large extent or entirely run by a few big entities For Cyprus ● 90% of Cypriots believe that close links between business and politics lead to corruption ● 83% of Cypriots believe that the use of connections are of essence for their business to succeed → Highest percentages among EU ● Citizens are doubtful of their government’s capacities to make the right choices ● Governments are not able to effectively regulate markets ● The wealthiest are often financing political parties ● Businesses exert undue influence over public policy ● Distribution of burden and reward across society is unfair ● The recent crisis has highlighted serious governance and regulatory failures, revolving doors, conflict of interests and regulatory capture. → Transparency is crucial to safeguard the integrity of the public decision making process THE 10 PRINCIPLES OR TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY IN LOBBYING 1. All stakeholders should be granted fair and equitable access to the development and implementation of public policies 2. Rules and guidelines should address the governance concerns related to lobbying 3. Rules and guidelines should be consistent with the wider policy and regulatory framework 4. Countries should provide clear definitions about ‘lobbying’ and ‘lobbyist’ 5. Countries should provide an adequate degree of transparency to ensure that public officials, citizens and businesses can obtain sufficient information on lobbying activities. 6. Countries should enable stakeholders – including civil society organisations, businesses, the media and the general public – to scrutinise lobbying activities 32 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 7. Countries should foster a culture of integrity in public organisations and decision making by providing clear rules and guidelines of conduct for public officials. 8. Lobbyists should comply with standards of professionalism and transparency 9. Countries should involve key actors in implementing a coherent spectrum of strategies and practices to achieve compliance. 10. Countries should review the functioning of their rules and guidelines on a periodic basis and make adjustments where necessary. GOOD PRACTICE IN REGULATING LOBBYING ● Lobbying registries for the lobbied and lobbyist ● Legislative Footprint ● Revolving Doors ● Conflict Interest ● Gifts provided to the lobbied ● Asset Disclosure ● Access to Information TIMEFRAME ● 1996 THE BEGINNING OF REGULATION ● 2008 FIRST REGISTRY FOR LOBBYISTS ● 2011 THE INTER-INSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT ● 2014 COMMISSION IS CALLED TO SUBMIT A NEW PROPOSAL ● 2018 A NEW IIA? ● 2019 NEW RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR MEPs CONFLICT OF INTEREST 33 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● A conflict of interests is defined as a conflict between the public duty of ESMA and any interests of an individual, interests of his/her close family members or of his/her employer, which could improperly influence the performance of his/her official duties and responsibilities, including the duty to act in the sole interest of the Union as a whole, or could compromise his/her impartiality, objec‐ tivity or independence. ● Ask students to break in groups and find cases of conflict of interest and discuss in class GUIDANCE ON AVOIDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST ● A conflict of interest shall be presumed to exist if an applicant, candidate or tenderer is a member of staff covered by the Staff Regulations, unless his participation in the procedure has been authorised in advance by his superior. ● In the event of a conflict of interests, the authorising officer by delegation shall take appropriate measures to avoid any undue influence of the person concerned on the process or procedure in question.’ ● Example of a personal interest: A head of a managing authority/paying agency: (1) might have a direct personal (family) interest in allocating EU funds to a project of the company of their spouse/partner (and therefore would need to declare a conflict of interest and abstain from being involved in decision-making related to that project, so that the situation can be managed); (2) might have an indirect personal (family) interest, in allocating EU Funds to a company that promised to create a new factory for which the company of the spouse/partner will most likely be the most significant sub contractor (and therefore would require them to abstain from decisions related to the award procedure) or owns the land that the company will have to buy to build the factory. ANOTHER EXAMPLE : Example of rules on ethics and conflicts of interest at Member State level: In one Member State, members of Parliament, members of Government or local executives are forbidden to employ as a parliamentary assistant or member of their cabinet a person from their ‘first family circle’ (spouse, children and parents). For the employment of a person from the ‘second family circle’ (brothers, sisters, brothers-in-law, sisters inlaw, nephews or nieces, ex-spouse, etc.), the law obliges the employment to be declared. ‘Situations which may objectively be perceived as a conflict of interest’ ● Any activity or interest, which could interfere with the impartial and objective exercise of the functions of a financial actor or other person, and thus affect public trust in the sound financial management of the EU budget, is a situation which may be perceived as a 34 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> conflict of interest. A perceived conflict of interest may notably occur when a person, regardless of their intentions, may reasonably see him or herself or be seen as having competing personal and public interests as these risk undermining the person’s ability to fulfil their tasks and responsibilities in an impartial and objective manner (e.g. a risk or possibility of favouritism or hostility for reasons of family interest and national or political affinity may objectively be perceived as a conflict of interest). ● A perceived conflict of interest covers objective circumstances affecting trust and confidence in a person’s or entity’s independence and impartiality, even if the conflict of interest does not materialise(23) or even if the person does not actually benefit from the situation. In this context, it is of utmost importance to safeguard both the effective observance of the rules on avoidance of conflicts of interest and avoid any doubts that a reasonable, informed, objective and good-faith person may have about the conformity of the behaviour of a person involved in budget implementation. ASSET DECLARATION ● PEPS ● Disclose their assets (movable and immovable property) and liabilities when they take up office and annually ● The same applies to their families (spouse and children) • Is the information audited/checked by the authorities ● What is the case in France? Should this information be disclosed in the media- Discuss EU PARLIAMENT LOBBYING AND ETHICS : ● According to an early draft proposal, EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola wants to ban MEPs from lobbying for two years after leaving the institution and oblige anyone entering Parliament in Brussels or Strasbourg to declare who they are meeting. ● SOS: How is the EU addressing Lobbying and ethics? Lecture 6: State Capture Lecture 6 ● Complément 6 ● State capture relates to the “firms shaping the formation of the basic rules of the game through private payments to public officials and politicians 35 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Influence relates to shaping and affecting formulation of the rules of the game without necessary recourse to private payments to public officials but with the exchange of votes. ● Administrative corruption is “ the extent to which firms make illicit and non- transparent private payments to public officials in order to alter the prescribed implementation of administrative regulations placed by the state on the firm’s activities”. ● Once legislation, protecting corruption, is enacted and enforced following the state capture which favours the few and selected individuals or organisations, this is then called legal corruption. Thus, there is an exchange “for the passes of specific firm-favoring legislation, or the exchange of public-sector procurement for later private sector jobs” (Kaufman and Vicente, 2011:196). ● It appears therefore that politicians through their connections with the private sector and vice versa, “exchange favours over time that pay each other”, by enacting legislation or approving particular procurement contracts which is beneficial to the private sector or the selected a few with connections in exchange for political funding or direct bribing of the politician (Kaufman and Vicente, 2011). The factors affecting the propensity of firms entering into state capture, influence or administrative corruption. They noted that: ● Larger firms are more likely to be expected to wield greater influence and engage in state capture than smaller firms that are more likely to enter into administrative corruption ● State- owned firms are more likely to retain considerable access to and ties with public officials enhancing influence on the state whereas new firms are likely to enter into state capture ● Firms with greater market power would be expected to be more influential and can enter into state capture whereas new firms are more likely to be subjected to demand for bribes thus they will enter into administrative corruption. ● When firms enter into state capture suggests that their relationship with the public sector are on an official bases and is due to private payments, thus, they will have low bureaucratic recourse (i.e. their access to public officials is not better than others, thus their limited access does not ensure them fair treatment against wrongdoings in getting access to superior in the public sector). The same would hold true for firms prone to administrative corruption. Whereas the firms that are active in influence will have high bureaucratic recourse (Hellman et al, 2000:12). ● Firms with insecure property rights are more likely to be tempted to state capture than the firms with more secure property rights that may be more likely to enter into influence. How to get rid of corruption: ● create a strong federal integrity commission, an independent commission that verifies if politicians follow a certain code of conduct. ● when government officials are appointed, it must be based on their merit and not on their connections. 36 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● create a register for lobbies ● publish the diaries of ministers, transparency on how they operate. ● politicians have to declare their donations over a certain sum of money, in real time. Bribe: you can provide people with information (useful data), you can provide favors or put people in positions of power. State capture: the exercise of power by private actors. They have control over resources. They can use forms of influence to implement services which serve their interests. State capture corrupts public life, starting with elections. According to the Australian report in state capture, the focus is on the machinery for making rules. State capture has the ability to define what is corrupt and illegal. They allow state capture to exist, to operate and to be powerful. 6 channels through which state capture is exercised: ● financial ● lobbying ● revolving doors (politicians who retire can get jobs in corporations) ● funding given to research ● impact on what transpires and how much influence the public campaigns have. Social media is a tremendous power but unregulated. Studies show how fossil fuels Corruption is endemic (image of the hydra, you cut one way of occruption, two come out). Corruption is national and international: no country protected In the public life (parlementarian, deputy, judges) BOUNDARIES Empathy minus boundaries is not empathy. Compassion minus boundaries is not genuine. Vulnerability without boundaries is not vulnerability 37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> SOCIETY Encourage civil Society Participation *Political Accountability through (Asset declarations, avoiding conflict of interest, revolving doors, lobbying, whistleblowing protection, implementing an effective anti- corruption agency, etc) Implement Integrity in the Public Sector *Embed in education curriculum ethical teaching 38 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> L7: Planning and administering an interview Lecture 7 et 8 People often don’t tell the truth, so how do you know someone is lying to you? Psychology and Law: a critical introduction, book by Kapardis. become familiar with someone’s voice and body language before starting an interview (interrogation) ● Fraud suspects vary immensely. ● Interviewing suspects effectively is both an art and a science ● A great deal is known about (a) BAD INTERVIEWERS and (b) WHY PEOPLE ADMIT/CONFESS TO A CRIME. Sometimes people admit because they feel guilty, especially in the case of sex crimes against family. ● The work of most investigators involves interviewing. An interview is : ● the most common technique used to investigate and resolve fraud ● a question-and-answer session designed to elicit information ● a structured (not free-form) conversation that has a purpose ● the systematic questioning of individuals who have knowledge of events, people, and evidence pertaining to a case Very different from an ordinary conversation because it is structured. THE AIM OF AN INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW To answer 5 Questions: 1.What has happened? 2.When did it happen? 3.How did it happen? 4.Who made it happen? 39 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 5.Why did he/she do it? Once these 5 questions have been answered, the case is closed. Establish the facts Identify possible offenses/ders Identify the perpetrator/s Gather sufficient evidence to prove or disprove an allegation In an investigation, you have to identify points that you have to prove. You need to be prepared to change direction if the facts change your direction and targets. Interviews also help obtain: ● information that establishes the essential elements of the crime ● leads for developing cases and gathering other evidence ● the cooperation of victims and witnesses ● information on the personal backgrounds and motives of witnesses Elements of a crime: ● the offence ● the offender ● the victims ● where and when Three types of interviewees: ● Friendly Interviewees ○ Go beyond normal expectation to help out ● Neutral Interviewees ○ Have nothing to gain or lose from the interview ○ Have no hidden motives or agendas ● Hostile Interviewees 40 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ○ May well be connected with the crime or the offender. ○ Try to size up and/or intimidate the interviewer ○ May misinform to throw off-scent Surprise interviews may give these less time to prepare. Characteristics of a Good Interview ● Sufficient length and depth ● Focus on pertinent information ● Should be conducted soon after the event ● Should be objective ● Endeavor to gather information in a fair and impartial manner ● Use the same gender interviewer as interviewee ● Should end on a positive note Characteristics of a Good Interviewer ● Outgoing personalities ● Interacts well with others ● Helps others feel at ease ● Does not interrupt respondents unnecessarily ● Displays interest in the subject and in what is being said ● Phrases questions in a non-accusatory manner ● Is on time ● Demonstrates a lack of bias ● Is dressed professionally ● Deals fairly with respondents ● Is an active listener ● Can be detached and yet involved. AVOID USING AN INTERVIEWER WHO ● Vulnerable to being manipulated. ● Does not take a professional approach 41 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Has dubious ethics. Police criminal investigators who hit their suspect are unethical. Sequence of Reaction of a guilty party ● Stage 1. Denial ○ Acts as a “shock absorber” ○ In the denial stage, people... ○ appear temporarily stunned or dazed ○ refuse to accept the information given ○ insist that there is some mistake, or ○ fail to comprehend what has been said. ● Stage 2. Anger ○ A dangerous time to resolve frauds ○ Suspects direct their anger at friends, relatives, coworkers and/or self ○ Others can insult, harm, slander, or libel suspects and may terminate them without due cause ● Stage 3. Bargaining & Rationalization ○ People attempt to justify the dishonest act and/or to minimize the crime and the likely consequence ● Leads to failure to prosecute, easy penalties, and weak testimonies ● Interviews can be detrimental to attempts to uncover the truth ● Stage 4. Depression ○ Many withdraw or lose interest ○ People no longer deny or rationalize the dishonest act ○ Anger is replaced by a sense of loss and disappointment ○ People often become withdrawn and uncooperative ● Stage 5. Acceptance (not a happy state) 42 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ○ Acknowledgement of what happened ○ A desire to resolve the issue and move on ○ Interviews are most useful and witnesses most cooperative at this stage Offenders don’t all go through the same stages. They can also through them in a different order. PLANNING AN INTERVIEW ● Follow a plan/outline to meet your objectives ● Review relevant documents to gather as much information as possible ● Set up an appointment ● Plan sufficient (even excess) time for the interview ● Conduct interviews at the interviewee’s office (except for hostile interviewees) CONDUCTING AN INTERVIEW ● Interviewer’s Demeanor ○ Establish good rapport ○ Ask a couple of easy-to-satisfy small favors from the interviewee before formally starting (they start to obey you) ○ Be efficient, courteous, polite, and careful with language used during interviews ○ Do not talk down to the person ○ Don’t take notes, videotape the interview and go back on it later. ● Language of Interviews ○ Use short questions, confined to one topic, which can be clearly and easily understood. ○ Maintain full control of the interview ○ Conversation management is essential. Interviewers ask five types of questions: ● Introductory ● Informational ● Assessment ● Closing 43 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Admission-seeking Elements of Conversation ● Basic Elements of effective conversation: ● Expression: use the other person’s expressions ● Persuasion: try to convince the other person that they need to cooperate ● Therapy ● Ritual: conversations are ritualistic (hello, how are you, very well thank you…) ● Information Exchange ● Inhibitors of Communication ● Competing Demands for Time ● Threatened Egos ● Etiquette (no offending the other person) ● Trauma ● Forgetting ● Chronological Confusion ● Inferential Confusion ● Unconscious Behavior ● Facilitators of Communication ○ Fulfilling Expectations ○ Recognition ○ Altruistic Appeals ○ Sympathetic Understanding ○ New Experience ○ Catharsis ○ Need for Meaning ○ Extrinsic Rewards 44 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> MECHANICS OF THE INTERVIEW ● Methodology ○ Make Physical Contact ○ Establish the Purpose of the Interview ○ Don’t Interview More than One Person at a Time ○ Conduct the Interview in Private ○ Ask Nonsensitive Questions ○ Get a Commitment for Assistance ○ Establish a Transitional Statement ○ Seek Continuous Agreement ○ Do Not Invade Body Space ● Question Sequence Questioning should proceed from the general to the specific; that is, seek general information before details are sought ● Note Taking Procedure is especially helpful should documents from a particular interview be compelled. ● Observing Respondent Reactions Must be knowledgeable about respondents’ behavior during interviews. ● Theme Development Be sure to formulate your questions in a way that does not elicit strong emotional reactions. ● Transition Methodology Once the introduction has been completed, transition to the body of the interview. NORMING AND CALIBRATING ● Use senses to establish a norm. ● Do not stare or call attention to the person’s behavior . ● Be aware of the respondent’s entire body. ● Observe the timing and consistency of behavior . ● Note clusters of behaviors . 45 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> TIMING ● Refrain from asking the next question until ● The individual has exhausted all the information he is going to provide. ● The interviewer has had the opportunity to prod the individual with comments such as “What else?” or “Go on.” “TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?” ● Spend a minimal amount of time talking, no more than 15 percent. ● Allow the subject the opportunity to answer without interruption. ● Allow a few moments of silence between questions or predicates. ● Consider who can confirm the information. ● Encourage the subject to speak NOTE TAKING ● Obtain biographical data and contact information for the subject. ● Initial and date the notes. ● Document the interviewer’s questions. ● Take adequate notes, after the interview, to allow you to prepare the report. DEALING WITH RESISTANCE AND DIFFICULT PEOPLES ● 65% of respondents will refuse an interview if contacted first by telephone ● 33% will refuse if contacted first by person. ● How do you deal with difficult people? MECHANICS OF THE INTERVIEW ● Volatile Interviews ○ Typically involve close friends and relatives of suspects, co conspirators, and similar individuals (less threatening) IMPORTANT POINTS ● Tough guys don’t get confessions ● Do your homework before the interview 46 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Know as much as you can about the suspect before the interview (religion, what do they care about, family, reputation, what makes them tick) ● Have a plan and be confident ● Rehearse if you have to ● Small talk on way to interview room ● What do you do if you have 50 suspects and 1 day? ask 5 questions INTERVIEW ROOM ● No windows ● Small ● Two chairs ● No posters ● No signs ● Quiet ● Small glass window in door if you MUST be interrupted INTERRUPTIONS ● Interruptions set you BACK ● They come at the worst time ● Establish a rapport ● Establish empathy ● Can’t do that with interruptions PART 3: POLICE USED SUSPECT INTERVIEWING TECHNIQUES Introduction. ● A professional approach to interviewing suspects: ● P.E.A.C.E, Specialist Investigative Interviewing (SI I). ● Characteristics of SII. THE 5 QUESTIONS AN INVESTIGATOR NEEDS TOANSWER IN A SUSPECT INTERVIEW. ● Why crime suspects confess. 47 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Four psychological approaches to obtaining a confession. ● Questioning techniques. INTERVIEWING IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD ● One of the core attributes expected of a good investigator is being effective and efficient at questioning suspects. ● A significant number of suspected fraud offenders confess if interviewed by a good investigator. ● Obtaining a confession is strategically important because police are more likely to formally charge a suspect and to end up with a conviction. ● Questioning suspects is a skill that is rarely taught well. A PROFESSIONAL APPROACH TO QUESTIONING SUSPECTS SINCE 1992 IN ENGLAND THE PEACE INTERVIEW MODEL ● P lanning and preparation; ● E ngage and E xplain; ● A ccount and Clarification; ● C losure and ● E valuation. P E A C E INTERVIEW MODEL ● UK Home office Model ● More effective and ethical alternative than the confession methods ● Focuses on neutral inquisitorial role ● Assessment Results PLANNING AND PREPARATION ● Plot events on a timeline for information retention ● What is known about interviewee and what needs to be established ● Points to prove, facts in issue ● Identify possible defences ● Practical issues (e.g. where, when, how) ● Aims and objectives ● Written plan 48 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ENGAGE AND EXPLAIN ● Engage in a conversation ● First impressions ● Explain purpose of the interview ● Reason, routines, outline, expectations ● Assess needs of interviewee ACCOUNT.. …..CLARIFICATION & CHALLENGE ● Uninterrupted Account ○ High use of open questions, summaries ○ Expanding and Clarify the Account ○ Question Loop…Open, Probe, Summarise as appropriate, Link ○ Done chronologically, methodically. ○ Locks person down into their account ● Clarification & Challenge ○ Challenging the inconsistencies & contradictions ○ Use the words of the interviewee, words of others and contradictory information/evidence ○ Non accusatorial ○ Ask interviewee to explain the differences between their account and the evidence CLOSURE ● Summarise account for mutual understanding ● All areas sufficiently covered ● Explain future activities ● Facilitate positive attitude of accurate and reliable information ● Review needs of interviewee ● Maintain professional style EVALUATION 49 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Evaluate information obtained ● Aims and objectives reached? ● Re evaluate evidence in investigation ● Evaluate own performance ● Evaluated by supervisor/advisor ● Needed for personal development SPECIALIST INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEWING ● Following empirical evaluations, THE PEACE METHOD HAS BEEN DEVELOPED INTO A MORE ADVANCED INTERVIEW METHOD KNOWN AS ● Specialist investigative interviewing (SII) ● Let us consider it SPECIALIST INTERVIEWING (SI) ● SI emphasises the importance of Prepare well for the interview. ● Establishing and maintaining rapport. ● Show empathy and compassion. ● Being a good, active listener . ● Be flexible in questioning ● Obtaining full and accurate information and not using such unethical tactics as threats and inducements. ● Use pauses and silences ● Avoid using leading questions. ● Be a good observer of verbal and non verbal cues to deception ● Use ISOPRAXIS (mirror the suspect’s behaviour, use neurological linguistic programming NLP) NECESSARY SKILLS FOR SPECIALIST INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEWING (SII) ● In the British study of SII by Bull and Cherryman (1995 ) a questionnaire was constructed on the basis of in depth interviews with 93 police officers experienced in SII. ● The officers concerned were asked what skills they considered to be the most important in officers who conduct SII as well as in themselves. ● ‘Listening’ was found to be considered the most important in SII. 50 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● Bull and Cherryman also found that the skills that were most often missing in police officers who conduct SII were ‘preparation’, ‘open mindedness’ and ‘flexibility ● AN EFFECTIVE INTERVIEWER OBSERVES AND UTILISES VERBAL AND NON VERBAL CUES TO LYING THE GOALS OF A SUSPECT INTERVIEW Horgan ( defines the goals of interrogation as including: (a) learning the truth of the crime and how it occurred; (b) securing an admission or a confession of guilt from the suspect ; (c) obtaining all the facts in order to ascertain the modus operandi and the circumstances of the crime; (d) collecting information that will enable the investigators to draw logical conclusions; and (e) furnishing the boss/prosecutor with the evidence required. THE 4 QUESTIONS AN INVESTIGATOR NEEDS TO ANSWER IN A SUSPECT INTERVIEW 1. WHAT has happened? 2. WHEN has it happened? 3. HOW has it happened? 4. WHO has doe it? 5. WHY has he/she done it? THE INVESTIGATOR INTERVIEDWING SHOULD MAKE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE 4 Qs. e.g., “Did you send the email to X? Did you have the skills to…? Were you under some kind of pressure at the time? Am I right that you needed money ? WHY DO SUSPECTS CONFESS TO A CRIME? Research with prisoners in Britain (has identified three reasons why suspects confess (a) proof (that is, the strength of the evidence against the suspect); (b) internal pressure (that is, a need to tell the investigator about the crime); and (c) external pressure (for example, police persuasion, fear of confinement). CONFESSIONS BY CRIME SUSPECTS: IT PAYSTO INTERVIEW 51 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● A high proportion (48 per cent) of suspects who are subsequently convicted and imprisoned initially deny their involvement in crime and a number (41 per cent) are unwilling to confess when first questioned. ● However, a significant proportion (48%) of suspects questioned by police make full or partial admissions/confessions (13%). ● PERSEVERENCE PAYS! A SHIFT AWAY FROM COERCIVE QUESTIONING There has been a shift over a number of years from coercive questioning practices to a new ethos of ‘searching for the truth. Interrogators use four psychological techniques of influence 1. Persuasion, 2. Deception, 3. Neutralisation , and 4. Normalisation SUSPECT QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES 1. Appeal to the suspect’s logic 2. Appeal to the suspect’s emotion 3. Aggressive approach. 4. Pretend indifference 5. Offer opportunity to save status. 6. Appeal to the suspect’s ‘Ego’. 7. Utilise exaggeration. 8. Drawing PART 4: DETECTING LIES Verbal and non Verbal cues to lying. Voice Stress Analysis (VSA)/ Layered Voice Analysis. Content Analysis. Conclusions PHYSIOLOGY OF LYING 52 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Detecting lies There are no quick and easy techniques for detecting lies; instead, careful practice and learning to look for patterns and comparison lead to expertise in this skill. THERE IS NO PINOCCHIO’S NOSE ! VERBAL AND NON VERBAL CUES TO DECEPTIVE COMMUNICATION We all make use of body language cues in oureveryday life and most people, for example, believe that liars avert gaze while many also consider nervousness when answering questions a good indicator of lying (GlobalResearch team, 2006). Peoples’ inability to discriminate,reliably between liars and truth tellers using verbal and non verbal cues to deception is partly attributable to their incorrect beliefs about lying behaviour. NON VERBAL CUES TO DECEPTION Vocal characteristics: speech hesitations, speech errors, pitch of voice, speech rate, latency period, frequency of pauses and pause duration. Facial characteristics: gaze, smile and blinking. Movements: self manipulations, illustrators, hand and finger movements, leg and foot movements, head movements, trunk movements and shifting position. Liars may experience the following three different processes during deception The emotional approach (Ekman, 2001) The content complexity approach(Ekman, 2001) The attempted behavioural control approach ( Granhag & Vrij ,2004) VERBAL AND NON VERBAL CUES TO DECEPTION (KAPARDIS, 2014) Conclusions that can be drawn about cues to deception that distinguish liars from truth tellers: They speak with a high pitched voice perhaps due to increased arousal, that can be detected with sophisticated equipment. Making fewer illustrators (i.e. hand and arm movements that accompany speech to ‘comment’ on what is being said), perhaps due to increased cognitive load. Their stories follow a logical chronological order. 53 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> They speak for longer. Their stories contain less detail, are less complete, less plausible and more ambivalent. They are less engaging; less involved and are less forthcoming and cooperative. ● Conclusions that can be drawn about cues to deception that distinguish liars from truth tellers ○ They make more negative statements. ○ They complain more. ○ Their faces are less pleasant and more likely to press their lips. ○ They sound less vocally expressive, are more passive and moreuncertain. ○ A nervous liar will blink more while a liar experiencing increased cognitive load will blink less. ○ They make more false as opposed to felt smiles. The two kinds of smile produce slightly different facial muscle actions a skilled observer can be trained to discern. ○ Their eye pupil dilates A person who is lying tends to have a higher pitched voice than a truth teller because of stress. Such differences are usually very small (only a few hertz) and can only be detected with sophisticated equipment. Equipment measures changes in microtremors in vocal muscles. One obvious advantage of VSA over other methods is it can be used to detect lying without the person physically being there or being hooked up to any machine. A more recent method than VSA is Layered Voice Analysis (LVA). It utilizes advanced technology and computer analysis of digitized sounds that are difficult to be picked up by the human ear to yield a ‘truth value’. CONTENT ANALYSIS ● Content analysis is a systematic technique for categorizing words into content categories using special coding rules. ● In essence, it’s a computerized qualitative method of determining characteristics of interest based on grammatical structure, word content, and other fundamental characteristics of written communication. ● Churyk et al (2008) has distinguished accurately between companies in the US that have restated their accounts and others that did not. 54 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> ● After decades of experience in the field and a great deal of research, the oldest and best method for lie detection is questioning a suspect, the approach most favored by law enforcement personnel. ● Questioning persons who commit such economic crimes as fraud against a company poses particular challenges because suspects are often highly educated professionals who can cover their tracks and calls for a high degree of professionalism INTERVIEWING SUSPECTS: CONCLUSIONS ● Successful interviews calls for a high degree of professionalism. ● Have an off sider and break to consult him ● Simulation and practice makes perfect. ● Research well the suspected fraud and the suspected person. ● Plan the interview well but be flexible if the need arises. ● Establish and maintain rapport with the suspect throughout. ● Treat the suspect with respect throughout. ● Observe the suspect very carefully, and videorecord, ifpossible. ● “Accept” a small lie to lead to a big lie. ● Home in tactically and methodically on points the suspects tries to avoid. ● “Help” the suspect to admit to the fraud and to save face. PART 5/ POST INTERVIEW TASKS It is good practice to review the performance of the investigators and results of interviews to ensure that all relevant information and evidence was obtained, new information is properly recorded and stored for future use and the future strategy/direction of the investigation is reviewed in the light of any new information/evidence. The best method of proving deception is by way of concrete evidence, so, it is important for investigators to keep an open mind before and during the interview. & Anything but a NO is a Yes The source of documents to be used in an interview must be considered before the interview Types of documents Production of documents during the interview 55 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Original or copy of document to be used.

Considering the CW4Kids was known for its programming from roughly 2008 to 2012, the game could feature a nostalgic roster of characters from various genres and series that aired during and prior to this period due to 4Kids\' history. Here are some shows and potential playable characters that would fit into such a game: # Sonic X - **Sonic the Hedgehog**: With his speed and iconic spin dash, Sonic would be a fast, agile fighter. - **Shadow the Hedgehog**: Using Chaos Control and similar moves, Shadow would offer a darker, edgier counterpart to Sonic. # Yu-Gi-Oh! series - **Yugi Moto/Yami Yugi**: Could utilize different Duel Monsters and spell/trap cards for attacks. - **Seto Kaiba**: Another duelist that could summon powerful monsters like Blue-Eyes White Dragon. # Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 series) - **Leonardo**: With his dual katanas, he\'d offer balanced speed and power. - **Raphael**: Using his sais, he could be a more aggressive, close-range fighter. - **Donatello**: Could use his bo staff and gadgets for reach and versatility. - **Michelangelo**: Might be the fastest turtle, using his nunchucks and quirky moves. # Kirby: Right Back at Ya! - **Kirby**: With his copy abilities, Kirby could adopt the powers of his opponents or use iconic moves like the Hammer or Sword. # Pokémon From the various Pokémon series that aired, players could control iconic Pokémon trainers like Ash Ketchum, who could battle using a selection of Pokémon such as Pikachu, or perhaps direct control could be given to individual Pokémon with a wide range of abilities. # Chaotic - **Tom Majors (Kazdan Kalinkas)**: Could use various Creature Cards to summon monsters from the show for attacks or defenses. # Winx Club - **Bloom**: With her dragon flame power, could offer a mix of magical attacks at various ranges. - Other Winx Club members like Stella, Musa, or Flora could provide elemental variety and tactics to the gameplay. # Dinosaur King - **Max Taylor**: Could summon different dinosaurs for attacks, each with unique abilities based on their type. Creating a game like this would involve balancing characters from vastly different worlds and genres, offering a unique challenge in game design. Each character or show brings its unique flair, requiring consideration of their powers, abilities, and the mechanics by which these could be translated into a video game format. Balancing would be key to making each character feel true to their origins while ensuring no single fighter is overpoweringly strong or weak against the others. This hypothetical game would be an exciting venture for fans of the various series aired on CW4Kids, providing a crossover experience that taps into a rich vein of nostalgia."},{"instruction":"Would any Kids WB shows (those that were on air at the start of the transition) be there","output":"Certainly, with Kids\' WB shows that were still on air during the start of the CW4Kids transition, there would be a unique opportunity to pull in a diverse roster of characters from those series too. The merger into The CW Television Network created a blend of properties from both the Kids\' WB and CW4Kids lineups. As such, characters from these series would indeed be viable candidates for a \\"Super Smash Bros\\" style game. Below are some shows and characters from the Kids\' WB era that could feature in the game: # Batman: The Animated Series/Batman Beyond - **Batman (Bruce Wayne/Terry McGinnis)**: Utilizing a combination of stealth, combat prowess, and an array of gadgets. # Xiaolin Showdown - **Omi, Kimiko, Raimundo, and Clay**: Each character could use their unique elemental abilities and Shen Gong Wu artifacts for special moves. # The Spectacular Spider-Man - **Spider-Man (Peter Parker)**: His agility, web-slinging, and spider-sense would make for a dynamic playstyle. # Static Shock - **Static (Virgil Hawkins)**: With the ability to control electricity and magnetic fields, Static could have a range of projectile and area-of-effect attacks. # Justice League/Justice League Unlimited - Characters like **Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and Green Lantern** could offer a range of powers from super strength, speed, to energy constructs, appealing to fans of superhero action. # Loonatics Unleashed - Future descendants of the Looney Tunes characters with superhero powers, like **Ace Bunny, Lexi Bunny**, and **Danger Duck**, could provide a quirkier set of abilities and fighting styles. # What\'s New, Scooby-Doo? - While not traditional fighters, characters like **Scooby-Doo or Shaggy** could have comedic, gadget-based, or mystery-solving moves that allow for unique mechanics. Including shows from the Kids\' WB lineup would not only expand the game\'s roster significantly but also its appeal, bringing in fans of both superhero genres and those with a taste for the comedic or fantastical. Considering the array of powers, gadgets, and abilities that these characters could bring to the table, developers would have a rich tapestry of inspiration to draw upon for creating engaging and diverse gameplay experiences. Each character could bring a slice of their respective series into the game, offering special moves and stages that reflect the essence of their shows. This would create a multi-dimensional fighting game that celebrates the legacy of Kids\' WB as well as the CW4Kids."},{"instruction":"Мероприятие будет направлено на отдых, расслабление, поэтому готовиться особо не нужно.

While these foods may not cure the underlying cause, they can offer symptomatic relief. Here are some good options: 1. **Spicy Foods**: Ingredients like chili peppers, wasabi, and horseradish contain compounds such as capsaicin that can temporarily relieve nasal congestion by thinning mucus. 2. **Chicken Soup**: It\'s not just an old wives\' tale—chicken soup can indeed help with congestion. The hot broth helps in thinning the mucus, making it easier to expel, and has mild anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe irritated passageways. 3. **Garlic**: Garlic is known for its antibacterial and antiviral properties. It can boost the immune system and is believed to help clear nasal congestion, partly due to the presence of allicin which reduces inflammation and offers relief to clogged nasal passages. 4. **Hot Tea**: Warm liquids can ease congestion, and teas like green tea, peppermint tea, or ginger tea not only provide a soothing effect but also contain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Peppermint tea, in particular, contains menthol which acts as a natural decongestant, helping to break down mucus. 5. **Citrus Fruits**: Oranges, lemons, and grapefruits are rich in vitamin C, which is known to support the immune system. While they won’t directly unclog your nose, their immune-boosting properties can help your body fight off the infection causing the congestion. 6. **Turmeric**: This spice contains curcumin, a compound that can help reduce inflammation. Adding turmeric to a warm milk (popularly known as \\"golden milk\\") or tea can help in reducing nasal congestion. 7. **Ginger**: Similar to garlic, ginger has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. Consuming fresh ginger or adding it to hot tea can help relieve a stuffy nose and promote the expulsion of mucus. 8. **Honey**: Adding honey to your tea or consuming a spoonful directly can offer relief due to its antimicrobial properties and its ability to soothe the throat, thereby indirectly benefiting nasal congestion. 9. **Pineapple**: Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme that can help reduce mucus production and swelling in the nasal passages, offering a natural way to ease congestion. Drinking plenty of fluids in general is also important as it helps keep the mucus thin and more manageable. While these foods and beverages can offer relief from nasal congestion, it’s crucial to address the underlying cause, especially if symptoms persist. Consulting with a healthcare provider for persistent or severe symptoms is always advised."},{"instruction":"What about cocaine. Tell me scientific way","output":"Using cocaine as a means to relieve a blocked nose or any nasal congestion is highly inadvisable and can lead to severe negative health outcomes. Scientifically, cocaine is a powerful stimulant drug that, in the short term, constricts blood vessels, including those in the nasal passages. This can lead to a temporary reduction in nasal congestion but at a very high risk. The discussion below outlines why using cocaine for this purpose is dangerous and not supported by medical advice. # Short-term Effects of Cocaine on Nasal Passages - **Vasoconstriction:** Cocaine induces vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels), which can temporarily reduce blood flow to the nasal tissues and decrease swelling, giving the impression of relieving nasal congestion. - **Reduced Mucous Production:** The drug can reduce the production of mucus, making the user feel as though their nasal passages are clearer. # Long-term Consequences - **Chronic Sinusitis:** Regular use can lead to persistent inflammation of the sinuses, causing chronic sinus infections and congestion, the exact opposite of the desired effect. - **Damaged Nasal Septum:** Cocaine is corrosive. Over time, snorting cocaine damages the mucous membrane of the nose, leading to sores, bleeding, and, with enough use, can perforate the nasal septum (the dividing wall between the two nostrils). - **Loss of Smell:** Long-term use can lead to anosmia, the loss of the sense of smell, which can be permanent. - **Overall Deterioration of Nasal Structures:** Extended cocaine use can result in necrosis (tissue death) of nasal structures due to reduced blood supply, leading to severe complications and deformities. # Systemic Health Risks Beyond the local effects on the nose and sinuses, cocaine use comes with significant risks to overall health, including the risk of addiction, stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and severe mental health disorders. In summary, while there might be a temporary sensation of relief from nasal congestion due to the vasoconstrictive properties of cocaine, the risks and long-term damage far outweigh any potential short-term benefit. The illusion of relief is accompanied by high potential for addiction, significant long-term damage to nasal and respiratory structures, and systemic health risks. For managing nasal congestion, safer and scientifically valid methods include using saline nasal sprays, steam inhalation, staying hydrated, and using over-the-counter decongestants and antihistamines, following consultation with a healthcare provider."},{"instruction":"How can use this function static int updateDisplay(void){ int ret = 0; switch (getDisplay()) { case eHomeDisplay : sprintf(cluster_screen.disp_name,currentDisplay); cluster_screen.width = m_parameterInfo[eHomeDisplay].width; cluster_screen.height = m_parameterInfo[eHomeDisplay].height; break; case eWideDisplay : sprintf(cluster_screen.disp_name,currentDisplay); cluster_screen.width = m_parameterInfo[eWideDisplay].width; cluster_screen.height = m_parameterInfo[eWideDisplay].height; break; case eDesktopDisplay : sprintf(cluster_screen.disp_name,currentDisplay); cluster_screen.width = m_parameterInfo[eDesktopDisplay].width; cluster_screen.height = m_parameterInfo[eDesktopDisplay].height; break; default: break; } ret = 1; return ret; } in Gtest with lass MockReadClusterCfg { public: MOCK_METHOD(bool, ReadClusterCfg, ()); MOCK_METHOD(int, getDisplay, ()); }; // Test fixture class class CfgRunnerTest : public testing::Test { public: virtual bool ReadClusterCfg() { // Virtual function to be mocked // Forward the call to the mock implementation return mockReadClusterCfg.ReadClusterCfg(); } virtual int getDisplay() { // Virtual function to be mocked // Forward the call to the mock implementation return mockReadClusterCfg.getDisplay(); } protected: MockReadClusterCfg mockReadClusterCfg; // Instance of the mock ReadClusterCfg };","output":"To use the `updateDisplay()` function in a Gtest with the `MockReadClusterCfg` class, you can create a test case in the `CfgRunnerTest` fixture class that calls the `updateDisplay()` function and mocks the `getDisplay()` function.

This could be due to a few reasons, such as incorrect setup of the mock or a mistake in the way the function is being called in the test case. Here are a few things you can check and adjust to resolve this issue: 1. Check the setup of the mock in the test case: Make sure that the mock is properly set up in the test case before calling the `updateDisplay()` function. You should set the expectation for the `getDisplay()` function using `EXPECT_CALL` before calling the function. 2. Verify the call to `updateDisplay()`: Ensure that the `updateDisplay()` function is being called within the test case after setting the expectation for the `getDisplay()` function. This call should trigger the mock and cause it to return the specified value. 3. Confirm the order of function calls: If there are multiple functions being called in the `updateDisplay()` function, make sure that the `getDisplay()` function is called at the expected point in the execution flow. The mock will only match the expectation if the function is called in the correct order. 4. Check for any typos or mistakes: Double-check the function names and arguments to ensure they match the mock setup and function calls correctly. Even a small typo can cause the mock expectation to not be met.

To resolve these linker errors, you need to ensure that each variable is declared (extern) in a header file and defined in only one source file. Here\'s how you can address this issue: 1. **Declare variables in a header file**: Define the variables in a header file and declare them as `extern`. Include this header file in all source files where the variables are used. For example, in a header file (`common.h`), declare the variables as `extern`: ```cpp extern int speedToRender; extern int gearStatusToRender; extern char gearTexFiles[]; extern char fontFilePath[]; ``` 2. **Define the variables in one source file**: Define the variables in only one source file. This file should contain the actual definition of the variables without the `extern` keyword. For example, in a source file (`variables.cpp`), define the variables: ```cpp int speedToRender; int gearStatusToRender; char gearTexFiles[SIZE]; char fontFilePath[SIZE]; ``` 3. **Include the header file**: Make sure to include the `common.h` header file in all source files where these variables are used.

Execution time can vary widely based on these factors. However, I can guide you through considering the factors that will impact the execution time and how to potentially measure it yourself. # Factors Influencing Execution Time 1. **Hardware Capabilities**: Faster CPUs (or GPUs if applicable and utilized) can significantly reduce execution time, especially for computational tasks like tokenization. The amount of RAM is also crucial when dealing with large datasets. 2. **Dataset Size**: The script processes 127,085 sentences (or fewer if `127085 // batch_size` does not evenly divide the full dataset). The size and complexity of these sentences (e.g., length, character diversity) will affect how long tokenization takes. 3. **Tokenizer Efficiency**: The implementation details of `fr_tokenizer` and `en_tokenizer` considerably impact performance. Some tokenizers are optimized for batch operations or specialized hardware acceleration. 4. **Python Overheads**: The use of `numpy().decode(\'utf-8\')` and list operations in Python adds overhead. While TensorFlow aims to mitigate such overheads when running in graph mode, interactions with numpy and Python I/O can still slow things down. 5. **Parallelism and Batching**: The degree to which the tokenization process can be parallelized or effectively batch-processed is pivotal. Larger batches are generally more efficient but require more memory. # Estimating Execution Time To estimate execution time yourself, you can use Python\'s `time` module to measure the time it takes to run sections of your script or the whole script: ```python import time start_time = time.time() # [Place your script or function calls here] end_time = time.time() print(f\\"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds\\") ``` # Rough Estimate Given the looping over batches and processing with TensorFlow operations, a rough estimate could range from a few minutes to several hours. If your tokenizer is highly optimized and you\'re using powerful hardware (e.g., a modern multi-core CPU or a GPU, if your tokenizer benefits from one), the lower end of this range is more likely. Conversely, if operating on less powerful hardware or if the tokenizer operations are particularly complex, expect longer execution times. For a more accurate estimation, consider running a smaller portion of your dataset—say, one batch or a small number of batches—to measure the time taken and extrapolate to the full dataset size. Keep in mind, however, that such extrapolations may not account for non-linear complexities or potential optimizations that kick in at larger scales."},{"instruction":"this code is 2 min : %%time en_vocab = bert_vocab.bert_vocab_from_dataset( tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(english_sentences).batch(1000).prefetch(2), **bert_vocab_args )","output":"Given that the provided code snippet takes approximately 2 minutes to execute, you\'re likely interested in how this timing might relate to the estimation or optimization of your original chunk of code that processes both English and French sentences using a tokenizer. The key information here provides a baseline for how long it takes to perform a relatively complex operation (building a vocabulary from a dataset of English sentences using BERT\'s tokenizer mechanism) on your hardware setup. It\'s a specific operation that can be somewhat independent of the broader tokenization and data transformation tasks you\'re looking to optimize or estimate time for. Nonetheless, it gives us a reference for the performance characteristics of text processing tasks on your setup. # Relating This to Your Original Code 1. **Comparative Complexity**: The operation you\'ve described (building a vocabulary from BERT) could be considered more computationally intensive than simple tokenization, given it involves analyzing the dataset to build a vocabulary, likely including frequency analysis among other steps. Thus, if simple tokenization and padding of sentences are the primary operations in your main script, it\'s plausible your per-batch operations may actually be faster. However, if your main script\'s tokenization process is similarly complex or involves additional processing steps not detailed in your code snippet, your times may be more comparable. 2. **Batch Size Considerations**: Your vocabulary building operation processes batches of 1000 sentences, which implies a specific performance characteristic at this batch size on your hardware. If your main script uses a different batch size (for example, 1024 as specified), the performance might slightly vary, though this difference should not be significant assuming similar hardware utilization and operation complexity. 3. **Hardware and Parallelism**: If your environment supports it, ensuring that operations like tokenization or vocabulary building are leveraging available hardware accelerations (such as GPU or TPU) can significantly impact performance times. Techniques like prefetching, as used in your code snippet (`prefetch(2)`), can also help by preparing data for processing while the current data is being processed, effectively overlapping data I/O and computation. Given these points, if we naïvely assume that the complexity of building the vocabulary for English sentences takes about 2 minutes, and that your main script\'s operations are somewhat less complex on a per-sentence basis but applied to a larger dataset and potentially more languages (English and French), a raw estimation might place your original code somewhere in the range of similar or slightly higher execution times, assuming other factors like hardware and batch size remain constant. However, it\'s crucial to remember that without direct testing or a deeper analysis into the specifics of each operation (vocabulary building vs. batch tokenization and processing), these estimates remain speculative. The best approach to obtaining a precise estimation is to measure execution times directly using timing methods as previously described, starting with smaller subsets of data and scaling up to predict more accurate total processing times."},{"instruction":"with ryzen 5 5600x","output":"Given you\'re running your tasks on a Ryzen 5 5600X CPU, let\'s refine the estimation discussion: # Hardware Specifications Influence: The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X is a powerful CPU with 6 cores and 12 threads, capable of high single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. This is an advantage for both single-threaded tasks (like some parts of data preprocessing) and multi-threaded tasks (potentially including parts of the tokenization process, depending on implementation). # What This Means for Your Script: - **Parallelization Efficiency**: TensorFlow and libraries you\'re using for tokenization might utilize multiple cores effectively, thus potentially reducing processing times for tasks that can be parallelized. - **High Throughput for Batch Processing**: Given the CPU\'s strong performance profile, you may find that you can process larger batches more efficiently than smaller ones, up to the limit of your system\'s RAM. This will depend on how memory-intensive the tokenization and batching process is. - **Potential Bottlenecks**: The primary bottleneck in this scenario may not be CPU computation but rather memory bandwidth and capacity, especially if your datasets are large or if the intermediary representations of the data (e.g., tokenized sequences) require substantial memory. # Estimating Execution Time: - **BERT Vocabulary Building**: The 2-minute timing for vocabulary building provides a rough baseline for intensive data processing tasks on this CPU. - **Overall Script Time**: Assuming optimal utilization of the CPU\'s capabilities and no significant I/O bottlenecks (e.g., slow disk reads), your overall script might exhibit similar efficiency for tasks of comparable complexity. However, the total execution time will also depend on: - The total amount of data being processed. - The complexity of the tokenization and padding process compared to the vocabulary building process. Because your tasks (tokenization and sequence processing) could potentially leverage multi-threading efficiently on a Ryzen 5 5600X, and assuming the tasks are sufficiently parallelizable, you might expect the per-record processing time to be favorable. Yet, the ultimate determinant of total execution time will relate to the dataset\'s size and the overall efficiency of your processing pipeline. # Actionable Advice: 1. **Optimization**: Ensure that any data preprocessing is optimized to take advantage of multi-threading where possible. TensorFlow typically does a good job of this automatically, but ensure you\'re using operations and settings that allow TensorFlow to fully leverage the CPU. 2. **Memory Management**: Keep an eye on memory usage, optimizing batch sizes to be as large as possible without exceeding memory, to maximize throughput. 3. **Profiling and Monitoring**: If possible, profile your script\'s execution to identify bottlenecks. TensorFlow offers built-in tools for profiling, which can help you identify parts of your script that are not efficiently utilizing the CPU. Given all these considerations, while precise time predictions are challenging without testing, your system should handle the described tasks efficiently, potentially processing each batch in several seconds to minutes, depending on the exact complexities and data sizes involved. Adjustments to batch sizes and parallel execution settings may further optimize execution time."},{"instruction":"for this batch_size = 1024 # Adjust batch size to your hardware capabilities. def tokenize_sentences(french_sentence, english_sentence): # Tokenize French sentences (with and without start/end tokens) in a single pass fr_sentence_text = french_sentence.numpy().decode(\'utf-8\') fr_sequence = fr_tokenizer.tokenize(fr_sentence_text).merge_dims(-2, -1) fr_sequence_decode = fr_tokenizer.tokenize(\\"[START]\\" + fr_sentence_text + \\"[END]\\").merge_dims(-2, -1) # Tokenize English sentences en_sequence = en_tokenizer.tokenize(english_sentence.numpy().decode(\'utf-8\')).merge_dims(-2, -1) return fr_sequence, fr_sequence_decode, en_sequence # Initialize lists to hold tokenized sequences fr_sequences, fr_sequencesdeocde, en_sequences = [], [], [] for french_sentence, english_sentence in dataset.batch(batch_size).take(127085 // batch_size): # Use tf.py_function to operate on the numpy values of each element batch_fr_seq, batch_fr_seq_decode, batch_en_seq = zip(*[tokenize_sentences(f, e) for f, e in zip(french_sentence, english_sentence)]) fr_sequences.extend(batch_fr_seq) fr_sequencesdeocde.extend(batch_fr_seq_decode) en_sequences.extend(batch_en_seq) # Stack and pad sequences fr_ragged = tf.ragged.stack(fr_sequences) fr_padded = fr_ragged.to_tensor(default_value=0, shape=[None, None, max_length]) fr_raggeddecode = tf.ragged.stack(fr_sequencesdeocde) fr_paddeddecode = fr_raggeddecode.to_tensor(default_value=0, shape=[None, None, max_length]) en_ragged = tf.ragged.stack(en_sequences) en_padded = en_ragged.to_tensor(default_value=0, shape=[None, None, max_length]) # Assign padded data to train variables x_train, x2_train, y_train = fr_padded, fr_paddeddecode, en_padded","output":"Given your detailed Python script and the considerations mentioned previously regarding the Ryzen 5 5600X\'s performance capabilities, let\'s dive into how you could potentially optimize this code to run more efficiently on such a system. The original tasks involve tokenizing and processing text data in batches for both French and English sentences, and then padding these sequences to uniform lengths. # Potential Optimizations 1. **Maximize CPU Utilization**: The Ryzen 5 5600X, with its 6 cores and 12 threads, excels at handling multi-threaded operations. Ensure TensorFlow and any other used libraries are configured to fully utilize all available threads. TensorFlow usually automatically manages this well, but explicit parallelization for CPU-intensive tasks could sometimes benefit performance. 2. **Batch Size**: Your selected batch size of 1024 is a good starting point, given the processor\'s capabilities. However, the optimal batch size could vary based on the specific memory requirements of the tokenization process and TensorFlow\'s overhead. Monitoring the CPU and memory usage during execution can provide insights into whether the batch size is too large or too small, allowing adjustments accordingly. 3. **Data Loading and Prefetching**: If not already done, implementing prefetching for your dataset can significantly improve performance by reducing I/O wait times. TensorFlow\'s `Dataset.prefetch` or `Dataset.cache` operations are beneficial when dealing with disk I/O bottlenecks. 4. **Optimize Data Pipeline**: Avoid decoding and then immediately re-encoding textual data if possible. Streamline the data pipeline to minimize conversions and data copying. The tokenization process is inherently CPU-bound, so minimizing unnecessary operations can lead to performance gains. # Rewrite Considerations If the tokenization libraries you\'re using are inherently Pythonic and don\'t leverage multithreading—or if they involve significant Python overhead due to the use of `tf.py_function`—you might consider whether there are more optimized tokenizer implementations available, potentially those that are either implemented as TensorFlow operations themselves or can run efficiently in parallel (e.g., using Cython or other C extensions for Python). # Measuring and Validating Optimizations **Profiling**: Utilize TensorFlow\'s built-in profiling tools (or other external profiling tools) to identify bottlenecks within your data pipeline and processing stages. **Gradual Optimization**: Start by identifying and addressing the most significant bottlenecks first, which often yields the most substantial performance improvements. After resolving these, move on to less critical optimizations. # Summary Given the hardware capabilities of the Ryzen 5 5600X, it\'s reasonable to expect that, with an optimized data pipeline and efficiently parallelized operations, the described tasks could complete in a timely manner, taking full advantage of the hardware\'s capabilities. The key lies in ensuring that the data processing and tokenization are as efficient as possible, minimizing unnecessary data transformations, and ensuring tasks are distributed across the processor threads effectively. Without specific details on the implementation details of `fr_tokenizer` and `en_tokenizer` and the nature of the dataset (e.g., average sentence length, total dataset size in memory), it\'s challenging to provide precise optimization steps or exact execution time predictions. However, applying general optimization strategies, as discussed, should help in achieving a more efficient execution on a Ryzen 5 5600X CPU."},{"instruction":"give me time estimation with 3 minute of margin error for you","output":"Estimating the execution time of a script with a precise margin of error (such as 3 minutes) without being able to run the script on the specific hardware, dataset, and without concrete performance metrics from similar tasks, is highly speculative. However, I can provide a ballpark estimate based on general principles and the details provided, with the understanding that the actual time may vary based on factors such as the specifics of the dataset, the implementation and efficiency of the `fr_tokenizer` and `en_tokenizer`, Python\'s overhead, TensorFlow optimizations, and system-specific characteristics. # Ballpark Estimate 1. **Single Operation Timing**: The given information suggests that building a BERT vocabulary from English sentences with a certain configuration takes around 2 minutes. This task involves textual data processing, which could be somewhat comparable in complexity to the tokenization and padding processes you need to perform, although the specifics might significantly alter the performance. 2. **Factors to Consider**: - **Dataset Size and Complexity**: The full operation involves processing 127,085 sentence pairs. This size is significant, but batching effectively reduces the overhead per sentence. - **Batch Processing Efficiency**: Batching generally increases throughput up to a point where the increased memory usage does not cause swapping or other inefficiencies. Since your batch size is 1024, and assuming your sentences and tokenization process don\'t result in extraordinary memory use per batch, the Ryzen 5 5600X should handle this without issue. - **Parallelization and Hardware Utilization**: Python\'s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) can be a limiting factor for multi-threading in pure Python code. However, TensorFlow operations are implemented in C++ and can effectively bypass the GIL, potentially leveraging the multi-threading capabilities of the Ryzen 5 5600X. - **Overheads**: `numpy()` calls and Python list operations add overhead, but profiling would be required to determine their impact. Considering these factors and assuming that the tokenizer\'s performance is somewhat similar to the BERT vocabulary building task: - **Optimistic Estimate**: If each batch of 1024 sentences (both English and French) can be processed at a speed similar to the BERT vocabulary construction (2 minutes for a significant chunk of data), and assuming efficient parallelization and minimal overheads, the processing might fall in the realm of several minutes to tens of minutes for the entire dataset. - **Pessimistic Estimate**: Accounting for potential inefficiencies in tokenization, overhead from Python operations that aren\'t efficiently parallelized, and any I/O waiting time (less likely if data is preloaded or efficiently streamed), the time could extend significantly. # Rough Ballpark Estimate With a 3-Minute Margin: Given the lack of exact equivalence between tasks and the variability introduced by data size and complexity, a rough estimate might place total execution time in the range of **20 to 60 minutes**. This wide range accounts for variability in data processing efficiency, with a **±3-minute margin of error** primarily to suggest the unpredictable nature of such estimations. # Recommendation: For a more accurate estimation, consider benchmarking a small portion of your task—say, processing 1,024 sentence pairs as one or a few batches—and then linearly extrapolating to the entire dataset. This method provides a more realistic baseline that accounts for your specific environment, dataset, and task complexity. Remember that execution times can vary nonlinearly due to factors like memory use and garbage collection, especially as the dataset size increases."},{"instruction":"16 gb of memory ?","output":"Running your script on a system with 16 GB of RAM introduces additional considerations primarily related to memory capacity constraints. While the Ryzen 5 5600X is quite capable in terms of processing power, the amount of available RAM can be a limiting factor, especially when processing large datasets or when operations require significant memory for intermediary representations. # Adjusting the Ballpark Estimate with Memory Constraints 1. **Memory Efficiency**: The key to efficiently processing large datasets, particularly when tokenization and padding can significantly expand the size of data in memory, is to ensure that data processing does not cause swapping to disk (i.e., using virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted). Swapping can dramatically slow down processing. 2. **Batch Size Consideration**: A batch size of 1024 might be suitable for the processing capabilities of your CPU but depending on the specifics of the data and operations (e.g., the average sentence length, the complexity of the tokenization process, the number of tokens generated, and the representation of tokens in memory), it could lead to high memory usage. Monitoring memory usage during processing can help you identify if the batch size needs to be adjusted. If high memory usage is detected, reducing the batch size could help stay within the limits of your physical RAM but may slightly increase processing time due to less efficient utilization of CPU resources. 3. **Execution Time Influence**: Assuming memory constraints do not force your system into swapping, the execution time may not be dramatically affected by having \\"only\\" 16 GB of RAM, provided that the processing is done in a way that is mindful of memory use. However, if memory constraints lead to swapping, this could significantly increase execution times. # Modified Estimate with 16 GB RAM: - **Optimistic Scenario**: If the data and operations are optimized to fit within the memory constraints, the time estimate might not be significantly different from the earlier provided range of **20 to 60 minutes**. This scenario assumes efficient memory use, no swapping, and that processing is the primary bottleneck rather than memory management. - **Pessimistic Scenario**: In scenarios where memory limits are reached and data needs to be swapped in and out of disk, the processing time could increase significantly beyond the initially estimated range, potentially doubling or more, depending on how often and how much data is swapped. # Recommendations for Memory Management: - **Monitor and Optimize**: Use tools to monitor memory usage during processing. If memory usage approaches the system\'s limit, consider adjusting batch sizes or optimizing how data is loaded and processed. - **Data Pipeline Optimization**: Ensure that data is not unnecessarily duplicated in memory and that intermediate representations are as efficient as possible. For example, ensure tokenized data is stored in a memory-efficient format. - **Incremental Loading**: For extremely large datasets, consider techniques that avoid loading the entire dataset into memory at once, if this is not already accounted for by TensorFlow\'s data pipeline. Given the considerations above, it\'s advisable to proceed with the outlined memory management strategies and adjust expectations for execution time based on observed memory usage patterns during initial runs of the script."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here, the main goal is to generate sequences of length `n_steps` for each batch without strictly defining the chunk size for each step. You can achieve this by modifying the iteration scheme to ensure it dynamically adjusts to your data\'s size while maintaining the sequence length requirements. Below is your updated code snippet based on the initial description. The key change includes using `n_steps` directly to influence the iteration without a fixed `batch_size`, thus ensuring that each sequence generated is exactly `n_steps` long, and the iteration covers the whole dataset as closely as possible given this constraint: ```python import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Assuming x_scaler and y_scaler are previously defined scaling functions # Also assuming feature_data and target_data are your input and output DataFrame respectively feature_data_scaled = pd.DataFrame(x_scaler.transform(feature_data), columns=feature_data.columns) target_data_scaled = pd.DataFrame(y_scaler.transform(target_data), columns=target_data.columns) # Define \'n_steps\', the sequence length for LSTM model n_steps = 10 # Example sequence length # Initialize start index start_ix = 0 while True: # Calculate the end index for the current sequence end_ix = start_ix + n_steps # Break the loop if end_ix exceeds the length of the dataset if end_ix > len(feature_data_scaled): break # Select the sequence from the feature_data_scaled X = feature_data_scaled.iloc[start_ix:end_ix] # Select the corresponding output; # taking the last output in the sequence for predicting the next value y = target_data_scaled.iloc[end_ix-1] # Increment start_ix for the next sequence start_ix += 1 # Reshape the input sequence and output for the model # Adjust the reshaping according to your model\'s exact input and output requirements yield X.values.reshape((1, n_steps, -1)), y.values.reshape((1, -1)) ``` This approach will iterate over the entire dataset, generating sequences of length `n_steps` for training the LSTM model. Notice that: - The loop terminates when `end_ix` would exceed the dataset\'s length, ensuring no index errors. - `start_ix` is updated by 1 after each iteration, allowing the function to slide over the dataset one timestep at a time, ensuring maximum usage of the available data. - This generates sequences in a rolling window manner, enhancing the model\'s learning by exposing it to as many sequential patterns as possible within the dataset. Remember to adjust the reshaping according to your LSTM model\'s expected input and output shapes, as well as tweaking the `n_steps` parameter to suit your specific forecasting or classification task."},{"instruction":"В какой области читать научные статьи на иностранном языке, чтобы встретить больший спектр разнообразных слов","output":"Чтение научных статьей на иностранном языке предлагает отличную возможность для расширения словарного запаса и знакомства с специализированной лексикой в той или иной области знаний.

Here is a list of the main titles and some significant spin-offs and related entries: Main Series: 1. Rayman (1995) 2. Rayman 2: The Great Escape (1999) 3. Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc (2003) 4. Rayman Origins (2011) 5. Rayman Legends (2013) Significant Spin-offs and Related Titles: - Rayman Junior (Educational series) - Rayman Raving Rabbids (2006) - This game shifted towards minigames and led to the spin-off Rabbids series. - Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 (2007) - Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party (2008) - Rayman Arena (2001) - A multiplayer game with racing and battle modes. - Rayman Golf (Mobile) - Rayman Kart (Mobile) - Rayman Adventures (2015) - A mobile game that blends adventure and classic Rayman platforming. The Rabbids series, while initially part of the Rayman universe, has grown into a separate franchise with many games and a television series, straying significantly from the Rayman platformer roots. In addition to these, there have been various mobile games, ports, and re-releases across different platforms. Ubisoft has expanded the Rayman universe over the years in various forms, including mobile platformers and educational games. Counting every single title, including major games, spin-offs, mobile applications, and educational versions, the number of Rayman-related releases is quite large. For a precise count including every variation and platform-specific release, one would need to compile a comprehensive list including all of these entries, but the main series consists of 5 primary titles."},{"instruction":"I asked for the total number of games","output":"Quantifying the total number of Rayman games, including main entries, spin-offs, mobile games, and educational titles across all platforms, involves considering a broad and varied collection. As of 2023, here’s a more detailed accounting: # Main Series 1. **Rayman** (1995) 2. **Rayman 2: The Great Escape** (1999) 3. **Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc** (2003) 4. **Rayman Origins** (2011) 5. **Rayman Legends** (2013) # Spin-offs and Major Releases 1. **Rayman Junior** (a series of educational games, varies by region and platform) 2. **Rayman Arena** (2001) 3. **Rayman Golf** (Mobile) 4. **Rayman Kart** (Mobile) 5. **Rayman Raving Rabbids** (2006) 6. **Rayman Raving Rabbids 2** (2007) 7. **Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party** (2008) 8. **Rayman Adventures** (2015) When considering multiple platforms, revisions, and the educational series under different names and formats, the numbers grow. # Notable Mobile and Other Platform Entries There have been numerous mobile games such as **Rayman: Jungle Run**, **Rayman: Fiesta Run**, and others that further expand the series\' footprint. # Summary The total, when including every distinct game, variant, spin-off, educational version, and significant mobile titles, can easily exceed 20 individual titles. The exact figure can vary depending on the criteria used for what constitutes a separate game (e.g., platform-specific releases, major updates, or editions). For a precise, up-to-date count, one would need to compile data from various gaming databases and resources, taking into account the various ways games in the series have been bundled, re-released, or adapted for educational purposes. However, as a rough estimate, counting only distinct titles across all formats and not including minor mobile titles or re-releases, Rayman-related games are around 20 or more."},{"instruction":"리액트에서 Input 태그를 통해 이미지 파일을 넣었을 때, blob을 가져올 . 수있어. 이 blob 데이터에 react-colorful처럼 쉽게 컬러를 클릭해서, 명조 및 채도 필터를 씌워진 파일을 s3에 저장시키고 싶어. 리액트 코드 구현해","output":"React에서 이미지 파일을 input 태그를 통해 업로드하고, `react-colorful`을 이용하여 색상, 명도, 채도를 조정한 후 수정된 이미지를 S3에 업로드하는 기능을 구현하기 위해서는 여러 단계가 필요합니다. 복잡한 과정을 간단하게 나누어보자면 다음과 같습니다. 1. **이미지 파일 업로드**: 사용자로부터 이미지를 입력받습니다. 2. **이미지를 캔버스에 렌더링하고 조정**: 입력받은 이미지를 캔버스에 렌더링하고 `react-colorful`을 통해 색상 조정 인터페이스를 제공합니다. 3. **수정된 이미지를 Blob으로 변환**: 캔버스에 적용된 이미지를 Blob 데이터로 변환합니다. 4. **Blob을 AWS S3에 업로드**: 변환된 Blob 데이터를 AWS S3 버킷에 업로드합니다. 아래는 이 과정을 구현하기 위한 기본적인 리액트 코드의 예시입니다. 이 예시는 주어진 요구 사항의 기본적인 접근 방식을 보여줍니다. 실제 구현시 AWS SDK 설정과 React Colorful에 대한 세부 사항을 추가로 고려해야 합니다. ```javascript import React, { useRef, useState } from \'react\'; import { HexColorPicker } from \'react-colorful\'; import AWS from \'aws-sdk\'; const ImageUploadAndEdit = () => { const [selectedColor, setSelectedColor] = useState(\'#ffffff\'); // 기본 색상 const inputRef = useRef(null); const canvasRef = useRef(null); const imageRef = useRef(null); const s3 = new AWS.S3({ // AWS S3 설정 accessKeyId: \'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID\', secretAccessKey: \'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\', region: \'YOUR_REGION\', }); const handleImageChange = (e) => { const file = e.target.files[0]; const reader = new FileReader(); reader.onload = (event) => { imageRef.current.src = event.target.result; imageRef.current.onload = () => { const canvas = canvasRef.current; const ctx = canvas.getContext(\'2d\'); canvas.width = imageRef.current.width; canvas.height = imageRef.current.height; ctx.drawImage(imageRef.current, 0, 0); // 이 시점에서 이미지를 캔버스에 그렸습니다. // 색상 조정 로직을 추가할 수 있습니다. }; }; reader.readAsDataURL(file); }; const uploadToS3 = (blob) => { const params = { Bucket: \'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\', Key: `your/path/{Date.now()}.jpeg`, // 파일 이름, 예: timestamp.jpeg Body: blob, ContentType: \'image/jpeg\', }; s3.upload(params, (err, data) => { if (err) { throw err; } console.log(`File uploaded successfully. {data.Location}`); }); }; const adjustColorAndUpload = () => { // 여기서 색상 조정 로직을 적용하고, 결과 이미지를 Blob으로 변환한 후 S3에 업로드합니다. // 이 예제에서는 직접적인 색상 조정 과정을 단순화하여 생략하고, 캔버스의 데이터를 Blob으로 변환하여 업로드하는 방법만을 보여줍니다. const canvas = canvasRef.current; canvas.toBlob((blob) => { uploadToS3(blob); }, \'image/jpeg\'); }; return ( <div> <input type=\\"file\\" onChange={handleImageChange} ref={inputRef} /> <canvas ref={canvasRef} style={{ display: \'none\' }}></canvas> {/* 화면에 보이지 않도록 설정 */} <img alt=\\"Uploaded\\" ref={imageRef} style={{ display: \'none\' }} /> {/* 화면에 보이지 않도록 설정 */} <HexColorPicker color={selectedColor} onChange={setSelectedColor} /> <button onClick={adjustColorAndUpload}>Upload to S3</button> </div> ); }; export default ImageUploadAndEdit; ``` 이 예시은 여러 가정하에 간략화된 코드이며, 실제로 이미지의 명도와 채도를 조절하는 복잡한 로직(예: CSS 필터, 캔버스 조작 등)은 포함하지 않았습니다. 이미지 조정을 위한 구체적인 구현은 프로젝트의 요구사항과 사용되는 라이브러리에 따라 달라질 수 있습니다.

In ventricular tachycardia (VT), electrical signals within the heart\'s ventricles fire abnormally, which interrupts the normal sequence of the heart\'s contractions. Specifically, VT causes the ventricles to beat faster than normal, often at a rate of 100 beats per minute or more, which can be dangerous. This rapid heartbeat does not allow enough time for the heart to fill with blood before it contracts, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rest of the body. **Causes:** Ventricular tachycardia is usually caused by a heart disorder, often the result of damage to the heart muscle from coronary artery disease, heart attack, cardiomyopathy, or congenital heart disease. It can also be triggered by electrolyte imbalances in the body, medication side effects, recreational drug use, or excessive alcohol intake. **Symptoms:** Symptoms of VT may include palpitations, dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope), shortness of breath, or chest pain. In severe cases, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation, which is a more dangerous arrhythmia that can cause sudden cardiac death if not treated immediately. **Treatment:** Treatment for ventricular tachycardia may involve: - **Medications:** Antiarrhythmic drugs can be used to stabilize the heart rhythm. - **Cardioversion:** If VT is causing severe symptoms or is unstable, an electrical shock may be given to the heart to reset its rhythm. - **Catheter ablation:** This procedure involves threading a thin tube through the blood vessels to the heart to destroy (ablate) the area of heart tissue that\'s causing the abnormal heart rhythm. - **Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD):** For patients at risk of recurrent VT, an ICD may be implanted. This device monitors the heart rhythm and delivers an electric shock to correct abnormal rhythms when detected. **Prevention and Management:** Long-term management of VT includes lifestyle changes, managing underlying heart disease, and possibly taking medications to prevent episodes of VT. Regular follow-ups with a cardiologist are crucial for patients diagnosed with VT to monitor their condition and adjust treatment as necessary."},{"instruction":"What is Apd in action potential in arrthymia","output":"APD, or Action Potential Duration, is a critical concept in understanding cardiac electrophysiology and plays a significant role in arrhythmias, including both their genesis and propagation. The action potential represents the rapid change in voltage (membrane potential) across the cell membrane of a heart muscle cell (myocyte) due to the flow of ions in and out of the cell. This process is vital for the initiation and conduction of electrical impulses through the heart, leading to its contraction. The action potential in cardiac cells can be divided into several phases (from 0 to 4), each characterized by the movement of specific ions like sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), and potassium (K+), through ion channels in the heart cell membrane: - **Phase 0:** Rapid depolarization due to Na+ influx. - **Phase 1:** Initial repolarization due to outward K+ current. - **Phase 2:** Plateau phase, where Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels balances K+ efflux. - **Phase 3:** Rapid repolarization, primarily due to increased K+ efflux. - **Phase 4:** Resting membrane potential, mainly maintained by K+ permeability. **Action Potential Duration (APD)** is the time span from the beginning of the action potential\'s upstroke (phase 0) to the completion of repolarization (end of phase 3). APD is a critical determinant of the refractory period, the time during which the heart muscle cannot be re-excited. A balance between the length of the APD and the heart rate ensures the proper timing of cardiac muscle relaxation and filling, crucial for efficient heart function. In the context of arrhythmias, an imbalance in APD can lead to various problems: 1. **APD Prolongation:** Can lead to early afterdepolarizations (EADs), a phenomenon where abnormal depolarization occurs before the heart cell has fully repolarized. EADs can trigger abnormal heart rhythms, such as Torsades de Pointes, a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. 2. **APD Shortening:** May result in conditions that predispose the heart to re-entrant arrhythmias, where electrical impulses continually loop through heart tissue, causing rapid heartbeats. 3. **APD Dispersion:** Differences in APD across the myocardium can create a substrate for reentrant circuits, leading to arrhythmias. Correcting APD abnormalities through pharmacological intervention or other means can help manage and prevent arrhythmias. For instance, antiarrhythmic drugs may be used to modify ion channel function, thus altering APD to stabilize heart rhythm. Understanding APD and its implications is fundamental in diagnosing, treating, and preventing cardiac arrhythmias."},{"instruction":"i have on my page phone numbers without country preffix and with it im using preg_replace to add a href buffer = preg_replace(\'~((+48 |.*?)605 697 177)~s\', \\"<a href=\\"tel:<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PHONE_NUMBER>\\">1</a>\\", buffer); How can i achieve this to work?","output":"Your current approach will create a hyperlink for the phone number \\"+48 605 697 177\\" within the given text. If you aim to also cover phone numbers without the country code (+48) and create `tel:` links for both cases, you\'ll need a more robust pattern. The regular expression must be designed to match both situations and replace them adequately. The following is an improved solution with explanations: ```php buffer = \\"Sample text with phone numbers <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PHONE_NUMBER> and 605 697 177.\\"; pattern = \'~(?:+48[s-]?)?(605[s-]?697[s-]?177)~\'; replacement = function (matches) { // Unifying the format to a single standard for the href attribute number = preg_replace(\'/[s-]/\', \'\', matches[0]); // Adding country code if not present if (!str_starts_with(number, \'+48\')) { number = \'+48\' . number; } return \\"<a href=\\"tel:number\\">{matches[0]}</a>\\"; }; buffer = preg_replace_callback(pattern, replacement, buffer); echo buffer; ``` # How It Works 1. **Regular Expression**: The pattern `~(?:+48[s-]?)?(605[s-]?697[s-]?177)~` is designed to: - Optionally match the country code `+48` followed by an optional space or hyphen `[s-]?`. - Capture phone numbers in the form of `605 697 177` or `605-697-177` (with or without spaces/hyphens between segments). It also allows the phone number with a prefix. 2. **preg_replace_callback()**: This function is used instead of `preg_replace()` to manipulate the matched strings more finely. It passes each match to a callback function where we can format the telephone number as needed. 3. **Normalization and Replacement**: - The matched string is first stripped of spaces or hyphens, ensuring a unified format. - The `str_starts_with()` function checks for the presence of `+48`. If it\'s missing, the prefix is prepended. - Finally, the unified number is used in a `href=\\"tel:\\"` link, maintaining the original format of the matched string visible to users. This approach is flexible and could be easily extended to support more variations by adjusting the regular expression and the logic inside the callback function. Ensure the regular expression accurately reflects the possible formats of the phone numbers on your page to prevent unintended matches."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To blame Nobody is to blame for this accident.","output":"Active and Passive Infinitives in the provided information are used to express various nuances of English grammar, primarily related to obligation, capability, and the existence of tasks or actions. Here\'s a detailed analysis of each section: 1. **The Idea of Obligation**: - Active infinitives, like in the examples \\"I have got some letters to write\\" and \\"I have a lot of work to do,\\" showcase personal responsibility or tasks that the subject plans to undertake. - Passive infinitives, such as \\"These carpets are to be cleaned\\" and \\"This form is to be filled in ink,\\" express obligations or expectations placed upon someone or something, often implying that the subject is not directly involved in performing the action. 2. **There is/there are Expressions**: - This structure is used to indicate the existence of tasks or duties. - Both active (\\"There is a lot of work to do\\") and passive (\\"There is a lot of work to be done\\") infinitives are utilized to highlight tasks pending action or completion, albeit from different perspectives. The active voice implies direct action required, while the passive voice suggests a broader, perhaps unassigned, obligation. 3. **Passive Infinitives**: - Examples like \\"to be seen,\\" \\"to be found,\\" and \\"to be congratulated\\" are entirely in the passive voice, focusing on the state or condition of the subject rather than who performs the action. - These phrases often express situations beyond one\'s control or acknowledgment of someone\'s achievements or status (e.g., \\"You are to be congratulated\\"). 4. **Something / anything / nothing to do /to be done**: - This structure pivots around possibilities or the lack thereof. Active infinitives (\\"There is nothing to do here\\") suggest direct actions that could be undertaken but aren\'t available. - Passive infinitives (\\"There is nothing to be done\\") often reflect a resigned attitude towards a situation that cannot be altered or fixed. 5. **To blame**: - The phrase \\"Nobody is to blame for this accident\\" employs a passive structure to communicate absence of fault. - Although not presented as an infinitive phrase, it carries a similar passive construction nuance, indicating that no individual should be held accountable. In summary, the use of active and passive infinitives carefully conveys the nuances of obligation, responsibility, potentiality, and passivity, significantly impacting the tone and meaning of sentences. Active infinitives suggest direct action by the subject, while passive infinitives indicate tasks to be accomplished or states being attributed to the subject, often without specifying the actor. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for accurate and effective communication in English."},{"instruction":"Використовуючи цю інформацію, переклади англійською: Ex. 1.

Казахстан, благодаря своему географическому положению, выступал своеобразным мостом между Европой и Азией, что способствовало многочисленным миграциям народов на протяжении всей истории. Важно отметить, что история Казахстана характеризуется сложными процессами формирования этнической карты, в которой каждая национальность внесла свой уникальный вклад. # Исторический контекст миграции народов в Казахстан 1. **Древние времена и средневековье:** Земли современного Казахстана на протяжении веков привлекали различные племена и народы, которые прибывали сюда, преследуя разные цели — от торговли до завоеваний. Кочевые и полукочевые народы, такие как саки, гунны, тюрки, играли ключевую роль в формировании этнокультурного ландшафта региона. 2. **Период Монгольской империи и последующие века:** После завоевания этих территорий монголами в XIII веке и формировании Золотой Орды происходит новый виток миграционных процессов, влияющих на этнический состав региона. 3. **XVIII–XIX века:** Период вхождения Казахстана в состав Российской империи ознаменовался приходом в Казахстан русских крестьян, немцев, украинцев и представителей других народов по программам колонизации, начатым Петром I и продолженным в последующие столетия. 4. **XX век:** Во времена Советского Союза происходило усиление миграционных процессов в рамках государства, включая переселение народов, в том числе военнопленных, осужденных и целых народностей, репрессированных и перемещенных в Казахстан. Также в страну прибыли рабочие и специалисты для развития промышленности, сельского хозяйства и науки. Это сформировало многоликое общество с большим этническим разнообразием. # Современная этническая картина Казахстана По данным переписей населения и оценок, в Казахстане проживает более 130 различных этносов и национальностей. Наиболее крупные этнические группы – это казахи, которые составляют основу населения, русские, узбеки, украинцы, уйгуры, татары, немцы Казахстана и многие другие. Это многообразие народов отражает богатую историю миграций, завоеваний, переселений и культурных взаимодействий, которые происходили на протяжении веков на территории современного Казахстана. Политика страны в современный период направлена на сохранение мира и гармонии между различными национальностями, активно продвигая идею мультикультурализма и толерантности."},{"instruction":"2)Разные волны появления национальных людей в Казахстан (их вроде 3 было)","output":"В истории Казахстана действительно можно выделить несколько ключевых волн миграции национальностей, которые в разные периоды пришли на территорию современного государства, обогатив его культурное и этническое разнообразие. Каждая из этих волн имела свои причины, особенности и последствия для демографической и социальной структуры страны. # Первая волна: Русская колонизация (XVIII – XIX века) Эта волна началась в XVIII веке и продолжилась в XIX веке, когда территория современного Казахстана вошла в состав Российской империи. Русские крестьяне, купцы, и военные стали активно переселяться в регион. Это было связано с политикой колонизации и освоения новых территорий империей. Русские и украинские переселенцы основывали поселения, внося вклад в развитие сельского хозяйства, торговли и промышленности. # Вторая волна: Советская индустриализация и депортации (1930-е – 1950-е годы) Во времена Советского Союза произошла массовая индустриализация, и в Казахстан были направлены тысячи рабочих и специалистов, включая русских, украинцев, белорусов, и многих других, для развития промышленного потенциала страны. Также этот период ознаменовался трагическими депортациями народов, пострадавших от репрессий сталинского режима. Среди них были немцы, корейцы, чеченцы, ингуши и представители других национальностей, которые были принудительно переселены в Казахстан. # Третья волна: Распад Советского Союза и независимость Казахстана (1991 год и далее) После обретения независимости Казахстаном в 1991 году ситуация в стране изменилась. Экономические трудности, изменения политической карты мира привели к новым миграционным процессам. С одной стороны, некоторые этнические русские и представители других народов, которые прибыли в Казахстан во время советской эпохи, начали эмигрировать обратно в Россию или в другие страны. С другой стороны, продолжалось перемещение людей внутри страны, а также прибытие мигрантов из соседних государств, в том числе рабочих мигрантов из Узбекистана, Таджикистана и Киргизии. Каждая волна миграции оставила значительный след в истории и культуре Казахстана, способствуя формированию уникального многонационального общества. Взаимодействие различных культур и народов в рамках одной страны способствует созданию особой среды, где гармония и уважение к разнообразию являются ключевыми принципами совместного существования."},{"instruction":"я задам тебе ряд вопросов но ты отвечай на вопросы максимально подробно и понятно четко и длинно Все это связано с темой ассамблея народа Казахстана 1)Когда вернулись репрессированные люди из СССР","output":"Восстановление прав репрессированных народов и их возвращение на историческую родину начались постепенно в ходе десталинизации, которая стартовала после смерти Иосифа Сталина в 1953 году. Возвращение репрессированных народов в свои исторические регионы и реабилитация их в Советском Союзе были многоэтапным процессом, протекавшим в разное время для различных этнических групп. Основной период реабилитации и возвращения репрессированных людей и народов приходится на конец 1950-х – начало 1960-х годов. Это был результат политики \\"оттепели\\", провозглашенной после XX съезда КПСС в 1956 году. С этого времени начался процесс официального признания неправомерности массовых репрессий и последующих депортаций целых народов, осуществленных по распоряжению сталинского правительства. Важно отметить, что возвращение депортированных народов не происходило мгновенно и во многих случаях сопровождался сложностями. Эти сложности были связаны как с организационными вопросами, так и с трудностями адаптации возвращаемых народов к новой жизни на местах их исторического проживания. Кроме того, не все репрессированные народы смогли восстановиться в своих традиционных местах проживания из-за различных обстоятельств, включая уже изменившуюся за годы депортаций демографическую и социально-экономическую ситуацию в этих регионах. Однако общий процесс реабилитации и возвращения являлся значительным шагом в истории Советского Союза и отдельных республик, в том числе Казахстана, к исправлению исторической несправедливости и устранению последствий массовых репрессий. Этот процесс также стал важной частью истории формирования многонационального и многокультурного общества в современном Казахстане, где уважение к истории и культуре всех народов, проживающих в стране, является ключевым принципом."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

Covey and first published in 1989. It presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what Covey calls \\"true north\\" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless. Here\'s a brief summary of the seven habits: 1. **Be Proactive:** Focus on things you can actually do something about. Proactivity is about taking responsibility for your life. You can\'t control everything that happens to you, but you can control how you respond to things. 2. **Begin with the End in Mind:** Envision what you want in the future so you can work and plan towards it. Understanding your personal mission and goals allows you to make decisions that lead you towards achieving them. 3. **Put First Things First:** Prioritize, plan, and execute your tasks based on importance rather than urgency. This habit helps you manage your time and energy effectively, focusing on what is most important. 4. **Think Win-Win:** Seek agreements and relationships that are mutually beneficial. In cases where a win-win deal isn\'t possible, agree to disagree agreeably. 5. **Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood:** Use empathetic listening to genuinely understand a person, which compels them to reciprocate the listening and take an open mind to being influenced by you. This creates an atmosphere of caring and positive problem-solving. 6. **Synergize:** Combine the strengths of people through positive teamwork, so as to achieve goals no one person could have done alone. Get the best performance out of a group of people through encouraging meaningful contribution and valuing differences. 7. **Sharpen the Saw:** Balance and renew your resources, energy, and health to create a sustainable, long-term, effective lifestyle. It primarily emphasizes exercise for physical renewal, prayer (meditation, yoga, etc.) and reading for mental renewal. It also mentions service to society for spiritual renewal. Covey\'s book has been highly influential, teaching individuals and organizations how to be more effective in personal and professional situations."},{"instruction":"Cześć. Mam problem z programem Blender. Używam wersji 4.02, ale odpowiedzi możesz udzielić dla innej wersji, jeśli nie znajdziesz dla tej. Potrzebuje użyć efektu \\"Freestyle\\" dla obiektu który jest za szybą. Czyli pierwszy obiekt (przezroczyste okno) od strony kamery zasłania drugi obiekt (drzewo, które stoi za oknem). Nie wiem co mam zrobić? (Próbowałem kilku ustawień np.: Visibility > Type > Quantitative Invisibility = nie byłem zadowolony, ale przynajmniej wyświetlał się drugi obiekt, który został zasłonięty pierwszym. Próbowałem także ViewLayer - nie udało mi się poróżnić warstw - nie wiedziałem o co chodzi, bo jeśli w jednej warstwie zaznaczałem że obiekt ma być renderowany, to i w drugiej warstwie także się zaznaczał. Nie mogłem uzyskać róznicy ustawień na dwóch osobnych warstwach. Próbowałem także dwóch scen z innymi ustawieniami i efekt był już pożądany, ale: nie mogłem uzyskać animacji z kamery (nie wiedziałem z której sceny kamera będzie aktywna, czy może z obu, jak doprowadzić do scalenia zapisywanych ścieżek do plików *.webp. Owszem zrobiłem w dziale \\"composition\\" dwie rózne sceny jako źródła złączyłem przez \\"Alpha Over\\" i wypuściłem to do renderowania, ale efektem było to że kamera stała w miejscu). Tak się zastanawiam czy istnieje jakiś jeszcze inny sposób, np.: ustawienia samego narzędzia \\"Freestyle\\" aby przezroczysta szyba nie blokowała obiektów wyświetlających się za tą szybą? Chyba że rozwiązaniem jest jedna droga z moich powyższych prób, tylko popełniłem jakieś błędy w uzyskaniu oczekiwanego rezultatu.","output":"Rozwiązanie problemu z dostępnością obiektów za przezroczystymi materiałami w Blenderze, szczególnie gdy chcesz wykorzystać efekt Freestyle, może być dość skomplikowane i wymaga odpowiedniego podejścia. Twoje próby z ich różnymi metodami były na prawidłowej drodze, ale każda z nich ma swoje ograniczenia i wymaga specyficznych ustawień. # Ustawienia Freestyle W przypadku użycia Freestyle w Blenderze, aby wyświetlić kontury obiektów znajdujących się za przezroczystymi powierzchniami, takimi jak szyba, możesz napotkać na problem, ponieważ Freestyle domyślnie nie będzie rysować linii za przezroczystymi materiałami. Jednak współczesne wersje Blendera umożliwiają pewne manipulacje, które potencjalnie mogą rozwiązać ten problem. Oto co możesz spróbować: 1. **Modify Freestyle Line Set:** Sprawdź w ustawieniach Freestyle (w zakładce Render Properties) podczas pracy na odpowiedniej scenie czy masz możliwość modyfikacji \\"Line Set\\". Możesz tam dostosować, które obiekty mają być widoczne dla Freestyle\'a przez dodanie specyficznych grup. Niestety, bezpośrednie omijanie przezroczystości w kontekście Freestyle może nie być bezpośrednio wspierane. 2. **Wykorzystanie warstw renderowania:** Mogłeś utknąć na etapie konfiguracji warstw renderowania, ponieważ każda zmiana wydawała się wpływać na obie sceny. Kluczem jest ustawienie różnorodnych obiektów na różnych warstwach renderowania (Collection) i następnie manipulowanie widocznością tych warstw dla różnych efektów Freestyle. Możesz zdefiniować, że konkretne warstwy są widoczne lub niewidoczne w zakładce View Layer Properties. 3. **Kompozycja Scen:** Idea z kompozycją scen była bliska rozwiązania, jednak problem z kamerą jest zrozumiały. Powinieneś ustawić aktywną kamerę dla każdej sceny oddzielnie i upewnić się, że ustawienia kamery są takie same, lub używać mechanizmu \\"Markerów\\" do zsynchronizowania kamery między scenami. Wykorzystanie nodów kompozycyjnych do połączenia rezultatów renderowania z różnych scen jest dobrym pomysłem. Używanie node\'a \\"Alpha Over\\" jest właściwą drogą; upewnij się, że odpowiednio manipulujesz przezroczystością warstw. 4. **Rendering Perspektywiczny:** Możesz rozwiać swoje wątpliwości co do ustawienia kamery poprzez stworzenie wspólnych ustawień kamery dla obu scen i następnie użycie tych ustawień w nodach kompozycji. 5. **Niestandardowe Rozwiązanie:** Można również spróbować stworzyć niestandardowy materiał dla \\"szyby\\", który będzie całkowicie przezroczysty dla rendera, ale nie dla Freestyle. Może to wymagać eksperymentowania z różnymi ustawieniami shaderów i być może nie będzie działać we wszystkich przypadkach. Mając na uwadze te różne podejścia, rozwiązanie problemu może wymagać kombinacji różnych technik i dużo eksperymentowania. Freestyle jest mocno zintegrowany z systemem renderowania w Blenderze, co może utrudniać omijanie niektórych jego ograniczeń, takich jak właśnie rendering obiektów za przezroczystymi powierzchniami."},{"instruction":"Mógłbyś mi rozwinąć (opisać) punkt 2. Tak zwróciłem uwagę że lepiej jest kontrolować to za pomoca \\"Collection\\", ale coś nie do końca mi to wychodziło.","output":"Oczywiście, z przyjemnością rozwinę punkt dotyczący wykorzystania \\"Collection\\" w Blenderze do kontrolowania widoczności obiektów dla Freestyle, co ma kluczowe znaczenie podczas pracy z różnymi warstwami renderowania i próbie uzyskania efektu obiektów będących za przezroczystymi powierzchniami, jak szyba. # Wykorzystanie Collection do kontrolowania renderowania: 1. **Organizacja Sceny:** - Pierwszym krokiem jest zorganizowanie obiektów na scenie w \\"Collection\\". Możesz mieć na przykład dwie kolekcje: jedną dla przezroczystego okna i drugą dla obiektów znajdujących się za oknem (np. drzewa). - \\"Collection\\" można tworzyć i zarządzać nimi w panelu \\"Outliner\\". 2. **Ustawienia View Layer:** - W Blenderze, każdy \\"View Layer\\" umożliwia różne konfiguracje widoczności, efektów i innych właściwości dla obiektów i kolekcji na scenie. - Przejdź do panelu \\"View Layer Properties\\" znajdującego się w zakładce Properties. Tutaj możesz manipulować, które kolekcje (lub pojedyncze obiekty) są widoczne czy też niewidoczne w danym warstwie. 3. **Dostosowanie dla Freestyle:** - W kontekście użycia Freestyle, interesuje Cię, jakie obiekty lub kolekcje powinny być uwzględnione w obrysach Freestyle. - W ustawieniach Freestyle dla danego \\"View Layer\\", możesz dodać \\"Line Set\\". W każdym \\"Line Set\\" jest możliwość wyboru konkretnej kolekcji, którą chcesz uwzględnić (lub wykluczyć) z renderowania linii. Oznacza to, że możesz zdecydować, aby linie zostały narysowane tylko dla określonych kolekcji, omijając przy tym inne, np. przezroczystą szybę. 4. **Konfiguracja Freestyle dla przezroczystości:** - Jako że chcesz uzyskać efekt linii dla obiektów zarówno przed jak i za szybą, sprawdź, czy w ustawieniach danego \\"Line Set\\" nie ma opcji, która pozwala na ignorowanie przezroczystości pewnych materiałów. Opcje te mogą różnić się w zależności od wersji Blendera. 5. **Rendering i Kompozycja:** - Po skonfigurowaniu wszystkich ustawień, możesz potrzebować renderować scenę wielokrotnie z różnymi konfiguracjami \\"View Layers\\", jeśli chcesz uzyskać szczegółową kontrolę nad przedstawieniem przezroczystości oraz obiektów znajdujących się zarówno przed, jak i za przezroczystą powierzchnią. - Wykorzystaj zakładkę \\"Compositing\\", aby połączyć wyniki renderowania różnych \\"View Layers\\" w jeden spójny obraz, używając nódów do manipulacji warstwami, maskami i efektami. # Wskazówka: **Przy eksperymentowaniu:** Utwórz prostą scenę testową z kilkoma obiektami i przezroczystą płaszczyzną, aby zobaczyć, jak te ustawienia wpływają na renderowanie i efekty Freestyle. Dzięki temu zrozumiesz, jak działa system kolekcji i \\"View Layers\\" w kontekcie Twojej pracy. Mam nadzieję, że to ułatwi ustawienie i pracę z obiektami za przezroczystymi powierzchniami w Blenderze. Powodzenia!"},{"instruction":"Dziwne to trochę dla mnie - ale czy potwierdzisz, że zanim rozpocznę rendering należy przejść do zakładki \\"Composition\\", aby rozpoczął renderowanie obydwu warstw, no i jeszcze dokonał całego złożenia poprzez \\"Alpha Over\\"? Bo jak jestem w zakładce Layout - to renderuje mi tylko tą warstwę w której aktualnie jestem.","output":"Tak, to, co opisujesz, jest typowym procesem pracy z kompozycją wielowarstwową w Blenderze, szczególnie gdy chcesz scalić różne elementy sceny, w tym przypadku z różnych \\"View Layers\\", w jedną spójną całość. Oto, jak ten proces zazwyczaj wygląda: 1. **Renderowanie Warstw:** - Kiedy renderujesz scenę bezpośrednio z zakładki \\"Layout\\" lub \\"Modeling\\", Blender będzie renderował obrazy na podstawie aktualnie wybranej warstwy widoku (\\"View Layer\\"). Oznacza to, że wszystko, co widzisz i jest skonfigurowane do renderowania w tej konkretnej warstwie widoku, zostanie wyrenderowane. Jeśli masz wiele \\"View Layers\\" skonfigurowanych do wyświetlania różnych części sceny (na przykład jedna z obiektami za szybą, a druga tylko z szybą), musisz ręcznie przełączyć się między tymi warstwami w panelu \\"View Layer\\" i renderować każdą z nich osobno, chyba że skorzystasz z systemu kompozycji. 2. **Kompozycja:** - Aby automatycznie renderować wszystkie niezbędne warstwy i połączyć je w ostateczny obraz, musisz skonfigurować nodalny system kompozycji w zakładce \\"Compositing\\". Tutaj właśnie używasz nodów, takich jak \\"Render Layers\\" do wybierania różnych warstw renderowania oraz \\"Alpha Over\\" do łączenia ich na podstawie przezroczystości lub innych kryteriów. 3. **Przechodzenie do Kompozycji przed Renderingiem:** - Po skonfigurowaniu swojego drzewa nodów w \\"Compositing\\", nie musisz fizycznie być w zakładce \\"Compositing\\" podczas rozpoczynania procesu renderowania. Wystarczy, że upewnisz się, iż opcja \\"Use Nodes\\" jest zaznaczona w zakładce \\"Compositing\\". Blender automatycznie weźmie pod uwagę skonfigurowane ustawienia kompozycji, kiedy rozpoczniesz renderowanie całej sceny. 4. **Automatyzacja Procesu:** - Dzięki skonfigurowaniu kompozycji, kiedy uruchamiasz proces renderowania (np. F12), Blender renderuje obrazy z wszystkich niezbędnych \\"View Layers\\" według potrzeb, a potem przetwarza je przez ustawione nodalnie efekty kompozycji, aby wyprodukować ostateczny złożony obraz według Twoich ustawień. 5. **Przeglądanie Wyników:** - Po zakończonym renderowaniu i automatycznej kompozycji przez Blendera, ostateczny obraz powinien odzwierciedlać wszystkie Twoje złożenia i efekty ustawione w kompozytorze nodów, włączając w to połączenie warstw metodą \\"Alpha Over\\". Zatem, jeśli Twoim celem jest połączenie różnych elementów z różnych \\"View Layers\\" przy użyciu efektów kompozycji, takich jak \\"Alpha Over\\", kluczowe będzie uprzednie skonfigurowanie tych ustawień w zakładce \\"Compositing\\" przed rozpoczęciem głównego procesu renderowania. Nie musisz jednak ciągle przebywać w tej zakładce; ważne, aby tylko przed renderowaniem wszystko było właściwie ustawione."},{"instruction":"Popraw mnie jeśli źle się domyślam.

Oto, jak możesz to zrobić w Blenderze: # Automatyczna kompozycja i renderowanie animacji: 1. **Przygotowanie warstw i animacji:** - Upewnić się, że animacja jest gotowa, a wszystkie obiekty są odpowiednio rozmieszczone na warstwach/zbiorach (collections). 2. **Konfiguracja View Layers:** - Ustaw różne View Layers dla różnych elementów Twojej sceny, zgodnie z potrzebami. Na przykład jedna View Layer dla przednich obiektów (przezroczysta szyba), a druga dla tych z tyłu (drzewo za szybą). 3. **Ustawienie kompozycji:** - Przejdź do zakładki „Compositing” i zaznacz opcję „Use Nodes”. Ustaw nod „Render Layers” dla każdej z Twoich warstw, a następnie połącz ich wyjścia z nodem „Alpha Over” lub innym nodem mieszającym, aby uzyskać pożądany efekt końcowy. Możesz korzystać z dodatkowych nodów do dostosowania wyglądu każdej warstwy przed ich scaleniem. 4. **Renderowanie animacji:** - Kiedy wszystko jest gotowe, i masz ustawione nodalne drzewo kompozycji, Blender może automatycznie renderować wszystkie warstwy i zastosować kompozycję dla każdej klatki animacji. Wystarczy tylko, że w panelu renderowania wybierzesz opcję renderowania animacji (przycisk „Render Animation” lub klawisz skrótu Ctrl + F12), a Blender zajmie się resztą. 5. **Zapisywanie wyniku:** - W ustawieniach renderowania (w zakładce „Output” panelu „Render Properties”) upewnij się, że wybrałeś pożądany format pliku dla animacji, na przykład jedną z opcji wideo jak MPEG, AVI lub H.264, a także ustawienia kodeka, jakość i inne parametry związane z wyjściem. Dzięki temu podejściu **nie musisz** renderować każdej warstwy oddzielnie, a następnie ręcznie je łączyć w programie do edycji wideo. Blender automatycznie zrenderuje animację uwzględniając ustawione przez Ciebie kompozycje nodalne, co jest dużym uproszczeniem procesu i pozwala na uzyskanie spójnych efektów dla całej sekwencji animacji."},{"instruction":"A samego Blendera i jego warstwę mam mieć ustawioną na 1 czy 2 (okno czy drzewo)?

Pozwól, że spróbuję uprościć i wyjaśnić proces krok po kroku. # Ustawienia Warstw i Ich Użytek w Kompozycji 1. **Konfiguracja \\"View Layers\\":** - **View Layer 1:** Pierwsza warstwa widoku może być na przykład dla twojego okna (przezroczystego obiektu). Nazwijmy ją \\"Okno\\". - **View Layer 2:** Druga warstwa widoku może zawierać drzewo stojące za oknem. Nazwijmy ją \\"Drzewo\\". 2. **Dodanie (opcjonalnej) Trzeciej Warstwy:** - **View Layer 3:** Ta warstwa nie jest konieczna dla samego procesu renderowania obiektów (okna i drzewa), ale jeśli chcesz dodatkowo zastosować ogólne efekty (np. korekcja kolorów) względem już połączonego obrazu z \\"Okna\\" i \\"Drzewa\\", możesz to zrobić, dodając efekty w nodach kompozycji po scaleniu dwóch pierwszych warstw. # Proces Kompozycji W panelu \\"Compositing\\": - **Użyj Nodes:** Upewnij się, że opcja \\"Use Nodes\\" jest zaznaczona. - **Dodaj Nody \\"Render Layers\\":** Dla każdej z twoich warstw (np. \\"Okno\\" i \\"Drzewo\\") dodaj po jednym nodzie \\"Render Layers\\". Właśnie tutaj musisz wybrać odpowiednią warstwę widoku dla każdego node\'a z menu rozwijanego w nodzie. - **Scalanie Warstw:** Teraz użyj nodu \\"Alpha Over\\" albo innego, który pozwoli ci na scalenie obrazu z \\"Drzewa\\" z obrazem \\"Okna\\". W pierwsze wejście nodu \\"Alpha Over\\" (zazwyczaj na górze) podłącz \\"Drzewo\\", ponieważ ma być ono \\"pod spodem\\", a do drugiego wejścia (zazwyczaj na dole) podłącz \\"Okno\\". - **Wynik do \\"Composite\\":** Ostateczny obraz z nodu \\"Alpha Over\\" podłącz do \\"Composite\\" Node\'a. To jest nod, który określa, co zostanie faktycznie wyrenderowane jako wynikowy obraz lub animacja. # Renderowanie Animacji - Wystarczy, że masz ustawione nodalne drzewo kompozycji zgodnie z powyższymi wskazówkami. - Teraz, gdy rozpoczniesz renderowanie animacji (poprzez \\"Render\\" > \\"Render Animation\\" lub Ctrl+F12), Blender automatycznie użyje ustawień z zakładki \\"Compositing\\" do obróbki każdej klatki animacji. Nie musisz renderować warstw oddzielnie. # Podsumowanie Najprościej mówiąc, nie musisz manualnie renderować warstw jeden po drugim i łączyć ich w zewnętrznym programie. Blender może to zrobić za ciebie, wykorzystując system nodów w zakładce \\"Compositing\\". Wystarczy prawidłowo skonfigurować \\"View Layers\\" i ustawić nody, aby odzwierciedlały sposób, w jaki chcesz połączyć i przetworzyć swoje warstwy. Mam nadzieję, że to wyjaśniło proces. Nie wahaj się zadawać dalszych pytań, jeśli coś pozostało niejasne. Powodzenia!"},{"instruction":"Nową warstwę mam tworzyć za pomocą \\"New\\" czy \\"Copy Settings\\"?

To dobre rozwiązanie, jeśli planujesz ustawiać każdą warstwę indywidualnie od początku. - **\\"Copy Settings\\":** Tą opcję warto wybrać, gdy chcesz, aby nowo utworzona warstwa widoku dziedziczyła ustawienia od istniejącej warstwy. Dzięki temu nie musisz ponownie konfigurować wspólnych ustawień, takich jak renderowanie cieniowania, światła itp. Może to oszczędzić sporo czasu i ułatwić zarządzanie spójnymi ustawieniami między warstwami. # Jak wyłączyć renderowanie danego obiektu na jednej warstwie: - **Exclude from View Layer (ikona oka z krzyżykiem):** Ta opcja całkowicie wyklucza obiekt lub Collection (zbior) z danej warstwy widoku. Oznacza to, że obiekt nie będzie miał wpływu na renderowanie ani obliczenia w tej warstwie, co może być przydatne do optymalizacji procesu renderowania, zwłaszcza jeśli obiekt nie jest potrzebny na tej warstwie. - **Disable in Renders (aparat fotograficzny):** Ta opcja wyłącza obiekt z finalnego renderowania, ale w przeciwieństwie do \\"Exclude from View Layer\\", obiekt wciąż będzie mógł wpłynąć na scenę, na przykład poprzez rzucone cienie lub odbicia, w zależności od ustawień obiektu i materiału. Użyj tej opcji, gdy chcesz, aby obiekt wpłynął na scenę ale nie był widoczny w finale. - **Hide in Viewport (oko):** Zmienia jedynie widoczność obiektu w edytorze widoku 3D, a nie ma wpływu na renderowanie. Używaj tej opcji, gdy po prostu chcesz tymczasowo usunąć obiekt z widoku podczas pracy nad sceną. # Rekomendacja W kontekście Twojego pytania, jeśli chcesz, by obiekt (np. drzewo) był wyłączony z renderowania na jednej z warstw, najbardziej odpowiednie będzie użycie opcji: - **Exclude from View Layer,** jeśli nie chcesz, aby obiekt w jakikolwiek sposób wpłynął na tę warstwę – ani przez widoczność, ani przez interakcje, takie jak cienie czy odbicia. - **Disable in Renders,** jeśli chcesz, aby obiekt wpływał na scenę (np. przez cienie lub odbicia), ale nie chcesz, aby był widoczny w finalnym renderze tej warstwy. Wybór między \\"New\\" a \\"Copy Settings\\" oraz odpowiednie wyłączanie obiektów w warstwie zależy od Twoich specyficznych potrzeb w procesie pracy nad projektem."},{"instruction":"Faktycznie w wersji 4.1 przy prostych figurach box i monkey - wykonał prawidłowo to co chciałem.

Rzeczywiście, drobne szczegóły konfiguracji mogą mieć znaczący wpływ na ostateczne rezultaty renderowania, zwłaszcza przy użyciu funkcji takich jak Freestyle, które są bardzo wrażliwe na ustawienia sceny i obiektu. Freestyle w Blenderze jest potężnym narzędziem do dodawania linii obrysowych do scen, ale jak pokazałeś, wymaga precyzyjnego dostosowania, by osiągnąć zamierzone efekty, zwłaszcza w skomplikowanych scenach z elementami przezroczystymi lub częściowo ukrytymi. Fakt, że scena zaimportowana z wersji 4.1 do 4.02 działa prawidłowo (pomijając ostrzeżenia o niekompatybilności danych), pokazuje także, że Blender wciąż rozwija się w kierunku większej elastyczności i kompatybilności wstecznej, co jest zachęcające dla użytkowników przechodzących pomiędzy wersjami. Jeśli chodzi o ustawienia, które ostatecznie rozwiązały Twój problem, na pewno społeczność Blendera oraz osoby napotykające podobne trudności byłyby zainteresowane dowiedzeniem się więcej o rozwiązaniu, które znalazłeś. - Jakie konkretne zmiany lub ustawienia w konfiguracji Freestyle okazały się decydujące? - Czy zmiana sposobu organizacji warstw lub obiektów miała kluczowe znaczenie? - Jakie znaczenie miało ustawienie warstw widoku i ich kompozycja? Podzielenie się Twoimi ustaleniami może być cenną wskazówką dla wielu użytkowników.

Szukam dalej i sprawdzam co jeszcze - bo to bardzo dziwne. ;-)","output":"Twoje spostrzeżenie dotyczące wpływu zmian w ustawieniach shadera Principled BSDF, a dokładniej wartości IOR (Index of Refraction – wskaźnik załamania światła) na działanie Freestyle, jest rzeczywiście interesujące. W Blenderze, wiele funkcji renderowania, w tym Freestyle, może wykazywać wrażliwość na pozornie nieistotne zmiany właściwości materiału. Oto możliwe wyjaśnienia oraz sugestie, jak możesz dalej badać tę kwestię: # Wpływ IOR na Freestyle - **Efekt Środowiska:** Zmiana IOR w shaderze Principled BSDF wpływa na to, jak światło przechodzi przez i wokół obiektu, co może oddziaływać na kalkulacje Freestyle w zakresie rozpoznawania krawędzi i linii obrysowych. Mimo że Freestyle ogólnie analizuje geometrię sceny do określenia, gdzie narysować linie, złożoność optyczne właściwości materiału może wpłynąć na percepcję geometrycznych granic obiektu. - **Możliwa Niespójność Stanu:** Gdy dokonujesz zmian w ustawieniach materiału, Blender musi ponownie obliczyć wiele aspektów renderowania dla danej sceny. W niektórych przypadkach, te przeliczenia mogą prowadzić do niespójności w tym, jak informacja jest przekazywana między różnymi modułami renderującymi – w tym przypadku między modułem renderowania a modułem Freestyle. # Sugestie do Dalszego Badania 1. **Czyszczenie Cache:** Blender, jak większość złożonych programów graficznych, korzysta z pamięci podręcznej (cache) do przechowywania informacji o stanie sceny, materiałów itp. Po dokonaniu zmiany takiej jak modyfikacja IOR, warto spróbować oczyścić cache przed ponownym renderowaniem. 2. **Nowa Scena:** Spróbuj stworzyć nową, prostą scenę testową (może być to ta sama konfiguracja z oknem i obiektem za nim) i zobaczyć, czy zmiana IOR będzie miała ten sam efekt. Jeśli problem się powtarza, ułatwi to izolację przyczyny. 3. **Eksperyment z Ustawieniami Freestyle:** Biorąc pod uwagę potencjalny wpływ właściwości materiału na działanie Freestyle, eksperymentowanie z różnymi ustawieniami Freestyle, jak \\"Line Thickness\\", \\"Crease Angle\\", czy selektory krawędzi (Edge Types), może oferować więcej wglądu w to, jak Freestyle interpretuje scenę w kontekście zmian materiałowych. 4. **Dokumentacja i Wątki Społeczności:** Blender posiada aktywną społeczność oraz bogatą dokumentację. Możliwe, że ktoś inny również napotkał na podobny problem lub że w dokumentacji znajdziesz wzmiankę o znanych ograniczeniach lub specyficznych zachowaniach Freestyle w kontekście zmian materiałowych. 5. **Raportowanie Błędu (jeśli trafne):** Jeśli po dokładnym badaniu jesteś przekonany, że zachowanie to jest błędem, warto rozważyć zgłoszenie go deweloperom Blendera. Blender jest rozwijany przez społeczność, a raporty błędów od użytkowników są cennym źródłem informacji na temat potencjalnych obszarów do poprawy. To, że powrócenie do poprzednich ustawień IOR nie przywraca działania Freestyle, może sugerować głębszą złożoność w interakcji między systemem renderowania a modułem Freestyle, co bez wątpienia jest interesującym tematem do dalszego badania."},{"instruction":"Dzięki bardzo za Twoje podpowiedzi, przydadzą się na teraz i na przyszłość. Mam już kolejne wyniki: - w wersji 4.1 bez znaczenia jest zmienianie IOR - działa bez zarzutu. Czyli jest 1.45, a potem 1.500 i z powrotem na 1.450 - działa dobrze bez względu na zmiany - także na ustawieniach IOR np.: 2.200 Może w nowej wersji dokonali znaczących zmian odnośnie Freestyle. Zaraz to sprawdzę.","output":"Cieszę się, że informacje były pomocne i doceniam Twoje chęci do dzielenia się wynikami eksperymentów. Wnioski dotyczące zachowania Freestyle w wersji 4.1 Blendera wskazują na bardzo pozytywny rozwój narzędzia i jego adaptację do zmieniających się wymagań użytkowników oraz różnorodnych scenariuszy użycia. Rozwój Blendera, włącznie z narzędziem Freestyle, jest dynamiczny. Deweloperzy ciągle pracują nad ulepszeniami, wprowadzając nowe funkcje, poprawiając istniejące i rozwiązując problemy, które mogły pojawić się w poprzednich wersjach. To, że zmiany w IOR nie wpływają negatywnie na działanie Freestyle w wersji 4.1, może świadczyć o udoskonaleniach w silniku renderującym lub samym module Freestyle, co jest świetną wiadomością dla artystów i twórców używających Blendera. Tak naprawdę, każde dużo wydanie Blendera może przynieść znaczące zmiany w funkcjonowaniu narzędzi, nie tylko poprawiając wydajność i stabilność, ale także dodając nowe możliwości, których wcześniej brakowało. Zawsze warto być na bieżąco z aktualizacjami i sprawdzać, jak nowe wersje mogą wpłynąć na Twoje projekty. Jeśli znajdziesz więcej interesujących różnic między wersjami czy dodatkowe ulepszenia dotyczące Freestyle (lub innych funkcji) w najnowszej wersji Blendera, Twoje spostrzeżenia z pewnością będą cenne dla społeczności użytkowników i mogą pomóc w lepszym zrozumieniu potencjału narzędzia.

Czy mogę w programie Blender, mają figurę typu \\"box\\" wykonać instancję tej figury (powiedzmy 3 razy, poprzez skrót klawiaturowy Alt + D) następnie chciałbym aby każda instancja miała przypisaną losową teksturę lub naklejkę typu decal itp. Czy da się coś takiego zrealizować na instancjach?","output":"Cześć! Tak, w Blenderze możesz łatwo stworzyć instancje obiektu (w tym przypadku „box”) używając skrótu Alt + D, co pozwoli Ci na stworzenie tzw. „linked duplicates”. Instancje te mają wspólną geometrię z obiektem źródłowym, więc zmiany w geometrii (np. dodanie nowych wierzchołków, krawędzi, itp.) wpłyną na wszystkie instancje. Natomiast transformacje takie jak przesunięcie, obrót czy skalowanie mogą być stosowane indywidualnie do każdej instancji. Jednakże, kiedy mówimy o przypisywaniu losowej tekstury lub decali do każdej instancji, sytuacja staje się nieco bardziej skomplikowana, ponieważ standardowo instancje dzielą nie tylko geometrię, ale także materiały. # Osiągnięcie Losowości w Teksturach: Jednak istnieją różne techniki, które mogą Ci pomóc osiągnąć efekt losowego przypisania tekstur: 1. **Nody materiałów z użyciem losowości:** - W shaderach możesz wykorzystać informację o lokalizacji obiektu lub użyć wbudowanego węzła „Object Info” (informacje o obiekcie), który ma wyjście „Random” dostarczające losową wartość dla każdej instancji obiektu. Można tę wartość wykorzystać do zmiany współczynnika mieszania między różnymi teksturami w ramach jednego materiału przydzielonego do wszystkich instancji. 2. **Geometry Nodes:** - Od wersji 2.92 Blender wprowadził Geometry Nodes, potężne narzędzie proceduralnej geometrii i atrybutów, które umożliwia generowanie różnorodnych wzorów i struktur. Można je również wykorzystać do proceduralnego przypisywania różnych materiałów lub zmieniania właściwości materiałów na instancjach. 3. **Scripting:** - Jeśli znasz podstawy Pythona, możesz napisać prosty skrypt, który przeiteruje przez instancje obiektu w twojej scenie i przypisze im losowe materiały z uprzednio przygotowanej puli materiałów. # Przykład z użyciem noda „Object Info”: Chociaż nie można bezpośrednio przypisać całkowicie różnych materiałów do linked duplicates (instancji) bez ich realnego rozdzielania (co sprawiałoby, że przestają być one interaktywnymi klonami), poniższy przykład pokazuje, jak można uzyskać efekt różnych tekstur za pomocą noda „Object Info” i noda „Mix Shader”: 1. Dodaj kilka tekstur do swojego materiału. 2. Wykorzystaj wyjście „Random” z noda „Object Info”, aby wpłynąć na faktor noda „Mix Shader” mieszającego twoje tekstury. 3. Możesz dodać więcej nód „Mix Shader”, aby włączyć więcej niż dwie tekstury, sterując nimi poprzez użycie różnych kombinacji wartości „Random” i przeliczeń matematycznych. Pamiętaj jednak, że tego typu rozwiązanie opiera się na materiale zawierającym wszystkie tekstury, co może wpłynąć na wydajność, jeśli tekstur jest dużo i są one szczegółowe. To podejście pozwoli Ci na pewien poziom losowości bez potrzeby ręcznego przypisywania materiałów dla każdej instancji, chociaż jego zakres i kontrola są pewnym kompromisem między łatwością użycia a elastycznością."},{"instruction":"Potrzebuje znaleźć wyraz związany z turystyką, wakacjami, wypoczynkiem, relaksem itp. który zawiera literkę \\"o\\" na 6 miejscu.

Znaleść środek dla każdej literki alfabetu. Ale nie chodzi o \\"Orgin to center of mass\\"","output":"Jeśli chodzi o znajdowanie \\"środka\\" dla każdej literki alfabetu w Blenderze, a nie interesuje Cię opcja \\"Origin to Center of Mass\\" (Początek do środka masy), to prawdopodobnie chcesz znaleźć sposób na wyśrodkowanie liter indywidualnie bądź jako grupy obiektów w przestrzeni 3D, przy zachowaniu ich indywidualnych środków. Tutaj pojawiają się dwie główne koncepcje: **środek geometryczny literki** (geometryczny środek literki) i **ustawienie początku literki** (origin literki). Dla jasności, „Origin” to punkt, od którego Blender mierzy pozycje, rotację i skalowanie obiektu. # A. Ustawienie indywidualnego środka dla każdej literki: Jeśli chcesz ustawić środek (origin) każdej literki indywidualnie, założenie jest, że masz literki jako oddzielne obiekty. Oto jak możesz to zrobić: 1. **Wybierz literkę** – w trybie obiektu, wybierz obiekt literki, który chcesz dostosować. 2. **Przesuń Origin** – możesz użyć opcji „Set Origin” w menu obiektu (Object menu > Set Origin) i wybrać „Origin to Geometry”. To ustawi punkt początkowy (origin) obiektu na jego środek geometryczny. # B. Zarządzanie grupą liter jako jednym obiektem: Jeśli twoje literki są już częścią jednego obiektu (na przykład połączone w jedną siatkę Ctrl+J w trybie edycji), a chcesz ustawić wspólny środek dla nich: 1. **Wejdź w tryb edycji** (Edit Mode) dla tego obiektu. 2. **Wybierz wszystkie wierzchołki** liter (A do zaznaczenia wszystkiego). 3. **Przesuń \'Median Point\'** – to jest punkt, wokół którego domyślne transformacje (przesunięcie, obrót, skalowanie) wykonują operacje w trybie edycji. Możesz też ustawić Origin dla całego obiektu używając „Set Origin” w menu obiektu i wybierając, na przykład, „Origin to Center of Mass” lub „Origin to Geometry”, aby kontrolować, jak obiekt będzie się zachowywał podczas transformacji w trybie obiektu. # C. Używanie Cursora 3D do precyzyjnego umiejscowienia: 1. **Przesuń 3D Cursor** do miejsca, gdzie chcesz mieć nowy środek dla liter/obiektu. 2. **Użyj \'Set Origin\'** i wybierz „Origin to 3D Cursor”, aby przesunąć origin obiektu do położenia 3D Cursora. W zależności od Twojego konkretnego celu (na przykład animacja tekstu, tworzenie tytułów itp.), możesz chcieć zarządzać literkami indywidualnie jako oddzielne obiekty lub jako połączone elementy jednego większego obiektu.

I problem jaki mam to, że po umieszczeniu włosów na głowie (sphare mesh) włosy mają odstęp od siatki - dodaje włosy za pomocą Particle Edit > Add Hairs. A chciałbym aby bezpośrednio dotykały siatki. I mam jeszcze jedną dodatkową prośbę, jakbyś mi wytłumaczył do czego służy funkcja \\"Regrow\\" < w dziale Particle System > Hair i pod spodem mamy funkcje Emitter oraz Hair > a potem jest \\"Regrow i Advanced - chodzi mi o to \\"Regrow\\".","output":"Cześć! # Włosy oddalone od siatki: Jeśli włosy dodane przy użyciu Particle Edit w Blenderze mają odstęp od siatki, problem ten może wynikać z kilku czynników. Jednym z najczęstszych jest użycie modyfikatora Subdivision Surface przed modulatorem Particle System, co może spowodować, że geometria, na której działają cząstki, różni się od geometrii widzianej w widoku 3D. Oto kilka kroków, które pomogą upewnić się, że włosy są jak najbliżej siatki: 1. **Zmień kolejność modyfikatorów:** Upewnij się, że modyfikator Subdivision Surface jest umieszczony po modyfikatorze Particle System. To zapewni, że cząstki będą emitowane z już podzielonej powierzchni. 2. **Sprawdź Ustawienia Particle System:** Wewnątrz ustawień Particle System, pod sekcją \\"Emission\\", sprawdź wartości takie jak \\"Normal\\" i \\"Random\\". Ustawienie \\"Normal\\" na większą wartość spowoduje, że włosy będą \\"wyrzucane\\" bardziej na zewnątrz od powierzchni siatki. Wartość ta powinna być jak najniższa, jeśli chcesz, by włosy były blisko lub dotykały geometrii. 3. **Wykorzystaj opcję \\"\\"Deflect Emitter\\"\\"** w Particle Edit: Jeśli edytujesz włosy w trybie Particle Edit, upewnij się, że opcja \\"Deflect Emitter\\" jest aktywna i ustawiona na niską wartość (bliską 0), aby włosy były jak najbliżej powierzchni mesh. # Funkcja \\"Regrow\\": Funkcja \\"Regrow\\" w Particle System pod sekcją Hair służy do kontrolowania, w jaki sposób włosy są regenerowane (przeliczane) po dokonaniu zmian w ustawieniach systemu cząstek. Włączenie tej opcji spowoduje, że włosy będą \\"odrastać\\" za każdym razem, gdy dokonasz zmian w ustawieniach systemu cząstek, co jest szczególnie przydatne podczas eksperymentowania z różnymi ustawieniami i chcesz zachować ciągłą wizualizację wyników. Jest to sposób na dynamiczne aktualizowanie wyglądu włosów, bez konieczności ręcznego resetowania lub regenerowania systemu cząstek. W kontekście włosów, \\"Regrow\\" może być przydatna, kiedy chcesz zobaczyć, jak zmiany w ustawieniach systemu cząstek (takie jak długość włosów, ich liczba, rozkład itp.) od razu wpływają na wygląd włosów na twoim modelu. Włączenie tej opcji może być przydatne na etapie projektowania fryzur lub dopracowywania wyglądu postaci, gdy potrzebujesz, aby wszystkie zmiany odzwierciedlały się natychmiast w przestrzeni 3D. Podsumowując, kluczowe jest eksperymentowanie z ustawieniami systemu cząstek i modyfikatorów, by osiągnąć pożądany efekt z włosami. Funkcja \\"Regrow\\" w \\"Particle System > Hair\\" ułatwia dynamiczne dostosowywanie i podgląd zmian w trybie włosów, co jest przydatne podczas projektowania i finalizowania wyglądu postaci."},{"instruction":"Cześć. Jeśli piszę prawą ręką, to która półkula w mózgu jest za to odpowiedzialna i czy tym samym też dane oko np.: lewe jest bardziej aktywowane?","output":"Cześć! Jeśli piszesz prawą ręką, głównie angażowana jest lewa półkula mózgu. To dlatego, że lewa półkula kontroluje mięśnie po prawej stronie ciała. Ponadto, lewa półkula jest często utożsamiana z procesami analitycznymi, językiem, czytaniem, pisaniem i innymi funkcjami związanymi z sekwencyjnym przetwarzaniem informacji. Jednak kiedy mówimy o aktywacji oczu i ich związku z półkulami mózgu, sytuacja wygląda nieco inaczej. Pomimo tego, że kontrola nad ciałem jest przekazywana krzyżowo (czyli lewa półkula kontroluje prawą stronę ciała i odwrotnie), wzrok działa na nieco innej zasadzie. Każde oko przekazuje informacje zarówno do lewej, jak i prawej półkuli. Sygnały z lewego pola widzenia obu oczu są przekazywane do prawej półkuli mózgu, a sygnały z prawego pola widzenia są przekazywane do lewej półkuli. To oznacza, że nie ma bezpośredniego powiązania między dominacją ręki a „dominacją oka” w sensie aktywacji półkul mózgu odpowiedzialnej za przetwarzanie informacji wzrokowych. Oczywiście, ludzie mogą mieć „dominujące oko”, ale to zjawisko nie jest bezpośrednio związane z dominacją ręki ani z działaniem konkretnych półkul mózgu w tak prosty sposób, jak mogłoby się wydawać. Dominacja manualna (preferencja używania jednej ręki nad drugą) ma swoje odbicie w funkcjonowaniu mózgu, ale dominacja oczna jest nieco bardziej skomplikowana i nie jest tak ściśle powiązana z lateralizacją funkcji mózgowych odpowiedzialnych za ruchy."},{"instruction":"Cześć.

Ale opiszę proces, jaki powinien być możliwy do wykonania, bazując na ogólnej wiedzy o menedżerach pobierania i rozszerzeniach przeglądarki. W przypadku chęci zmiany nazwy plików podczas ściągania, dodając do nich tytuł strony z oryginalną nazwą pliku, będziesz musiał skorzystać z funkcji szablonów nazw plików (jeśli Chrono Download Manager oferuje taką możliwość) lub ręcznie zmieniać nazwy plików przed ich pobraniem. Ogólnie, funkcja tak jak \\"maska nazwy pliku\\" często umożliwia ustawienie schematu nazewnictwa plików, który może być zautomatyzowany. # Krok po kroku (opis ogólny, może różnić się w zależności od wersji i funkcjonalności Chrono Download Manager): 1. **Otwórz ustawienia Chrono Download Manager**: Sprawdź, czy w ustawieniach dodatku jest sekcja poświęcona zmianie nazw plików lub konfigurowaniu schematów nazw plików (mask). 2. **Szukaj opcji zmiany nazwy albo \\"maski\\"**: Idealnie, szukasz pola, gdzie możesz wpisać szablon nazwy pliku, który automatycznie będzie stosowany do pobieranych plików. Mogłoby to wyglądać tak: `[title]_[originalname]`. Oczywiście, konkretny sposób, w jaki wprowadza się takie schematy, będzie zależał od możliwości danego rozszerzenia. 3. **Filtr dla typów plików**: Jeżeli chcesz, aby reguła dotyczyła tylko plików obrazów, poszukaj miejsca, gdzie możesz określić rozszerzenia plików (np. `.jpg`, `.png`), do których ma być zastosowana maska nazwy. 4. **Użyj pomocy dodatku lub FAQ**: Ponieważ możliwości i interfejs użytkownika mogą się zmieniać, warto zerknąć na oficjalną stronę pomocy rozszerzenia lub FAQ, gdzie mogą być dostępne bardziej szczegółowe wskazówki dotyczące zmiany nazw plików. Jeżeli Chrono Download Manager nie oferuje bezpośrednio takiej funkcjonalności w prosty i automatyczny sposób, być może będziesz musiał poszukać innego narzędzia lub rozszerzenia, które specjalizuje się bardziej w zaawansowanym zarządzaniu pobieranymi plikami i oferuje większe możliwości w obszarze zmiany nazw według zdefiniowanych schematów. Warto również mieć na uwadze, że automatyczne dodawanie tytułu strony do nazwy pliku może nie być dostępne w każdym rozszerzeniu i może wymagać dodatkowej manipulacji lub może być dostępne tylko w bardziej zaawansowanych menedżerach pobierania."},{"instruction":"A co oznacza zapis w zakładce \\"Reguły\\" w kolumnie \\"Wyrażenie\\" zapis: *state*!=[finished]&&*state*!=[interrupted]","output":"Zapis ten pochodzi z systemu filtrów lub reguł, które są stosowane do zarządzania pobieranymi plikami lub zadaniami w pewnych programach, w tym menedżerach pobierania takich jak Chrono Download Manager. Wyjaśnienie zapisu `*state*!=[finished]&&*state*!=[interrupted]`: - `*state*` odnosi się do statusu pobierania pliku. W tym przypadku używa symbolu `*` jako symbolu wieloznaczności (wildcard), który mówi, że można zastąpić go dowolnym ciągiem znaków. Jednak w tym kontekście `*state*` najprawdopodobniej jest po prostu określonym atrybutem, który przedstawia obecny stan zadania pobierania. - `!=` oznacza \\"nie równa się\\". Jest to operator porównania, który sprawdza, czy dwie wartości są różne od siebie. - `[finished]` i `[interrupted]` to konkretny status pobierania. `[finished]` oznacza, że pobieranie zostało zakończone, a `[interrupted]` że zostało przerwane lub anulowane. - `&&` to operator logiczny AND (i), który łączy dwa wyrażenia warunkowe. Aby całe to wyrażenie miało wartość prawdy (true), oba warunki po obu stronach operatora muszą być spełnione. Całe wyrażenie: `*state*!=[finished]&&*state*!=[interrupted]` można przetłumaczyć na: wybierz lub aplikuj regułę wtedy i tylko wtedy, gdy pobieranie nie jest w stanie \\"zakończone\\" (`finished`) ORAZ jednocześnie nie jest w stanie \\"przerwane\\" (`interrupted`). Innymi słowy, reguła ta dotyczy aktywnych pobierań, które nadal trwają lub oczekują na rozpoczęcie i nie zostały jeszcze zakończone ani przerwane.

First, This email is not only for I missed my cab its more about for the behavior of transport team, instead of rectifying the error and getting things improve these guys are more interested in augment and hiding the errors. Multiple times I reported this kind of incident to transport team verbally and in writing also. 02. Now let’s come to point which is highlighted by Vishal. 01. Driver was waiting on another location, which is not my point. 02. Another employee who boarded cab leaves to next to location where driver was waiting 03. I have not received any call from transport team, in case I missed any call or someone try to call me I get notification on my phone. 04. Driver directly moved the cab without informing me. 05. If you feel the where I was waiting was the incorrect location, I can bring statements from all employees who take cab from Ramoshi Gate. This will be little time taking activity for me but if you need I will happily do it.","output":"Subject: Request for Urgent Attention and Improvement in Transport Services Dear [Recipient\'s Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you today not only to address a recent incident where I missed my assigned cab, but more importantly, to express my concerns regarding the ongoing issues with the transport team\'s behavior and their approach to resolving problems. Unfortunately, this recent occurrence is not an isolated incident. Despite my efforts to report previous issues both verbally and in writing, it seems more energy is being spent on arguing and concealing errors than in taking proactive steps to improve the service. On a related note, I would like to bring to your attention to a specific incident highlighted by my colleague, Vishal. There were several critical missteps that occurred, which I believe could have been prevented: 1. The driver was waiting at a different location, which was not the agreed pickup point for me. 2. Another employee who boarded the cab exited near the location where the driver was originally waiting, which indicates some level of confusion or miscommunication. 3. Notably, I did not receive any call from the transport team regarding the change in plans or to inquire about my whereabouts. I am certain of this as I typically receive notifications for any missed calls, and there were none. 4. Without any attempt to contact me or wait for a reasonable amount of time, the driver proceeded to leave the pickup point. 5. Finally, if there\'s any claim that I was waiting at the wrong location, I am prepared to provide statements from numerous employees who use the cab service from Ramoshi Gate, corroborating my claim. While gathering such evidence would be time-consuming, I am willing to undertake this if it would assist in resolving the issue at hand. The purpose of highlighting these points is not to assign blame but to request that urgent attention be given to not only this particular incident but also the overall approach of the transport team in handling such situations. It is vital for the efficiency of the service and the convenience of all employees that communication and operations are significantly improved. I trust that this matter will receive the attention it deserves and that steps will be taken towards not just addressing this specific case but also implementing systemic changes to prevent such issues in the future. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I am looking forward to seeing positive changes and am happy to discuss this matter further if needed. Warm regards, [Your Name]"},{"instruction":"lets say that you are a product owner with 20 years of experience","output":"Certainly, drawing from two decades of experience as a product owner, there are several key insights and responsibilities I could share. Successful product ownership involves a broad range of skills and responsibilities, all aimed at ensuring that the product not only meets the customer needs but also achieves business goals. Here are some vital considerations and lessons learned over those 20 years: # 1. **Deep Understanding of Customer Needs** Over time, it becomes increasingly clear that the backbone of any successful product is a deep, empathetic understanding of the needs, pains, and aspirations of its users. Regular interaction with customers and user feedback loops are crucial for refining the product. # 2. **Clear Vision and Strategy** Experience teaches that a clear, compelling vision for the product is essential. This vision must be well communicated and understood by every team member. It guides the product development and helps in prioritizing features. # 3. **Agile Mindset** Over two decades, the importance of an agile mindset and methodologies (like Scrum) has become evident. The ability to adapt to change, prioritize flexibility, and continuously deliver value to customers is critical in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing market environments. # 4. **Stakeholder Management** Building and maintaining strong relationships with all stakeholders, including customers, team members, and business leaders, is essential. Understanding their expectations, managing their aspirations, and keeping them informed and engaged throughout the product development cycle is crucial. # 5. **Data-Driven Decision Making** The best decisions are informed by data. Utilizing metrics to guide product decisions — from feature prioritization to identifying areas for improvement — ensures that the product evolves in a direction that adds value to both the business and its customers. # 6. **Leading Cross-Functional Teams** A product owner is often at the intersection of business, technology, and user experience. Leading and motivating cross-functional teams, while fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation, is key. Over time, the importance of soft skills, like communication and empathy, becomes as apparent as technical or business acumen. # 7. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation** Technologies, market conditions, and customer preferences change. Staying informed about industry trends, competitors, and new methodologies is crucial. Equally important is fostering a culture of learning and experimentation within the team. # 8. **Focus on Value Delivery** Ultimately, the success of a product is measured by the value it delivers to both the users and the business. This involves not just launching new features, but also optimizing existing ones and sometimes sunsetting those that no longer serve a purpose. # 9. **Risk Management** Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks is a continuous responsibility. Whether it’s technological, market-related, or operational, being proactive about risks can save a lot of trouble down the line. # 10. **Prioritization is Key** With limited resources and time, effective prioritization is perhaps one of the most critical skills. Learning to say \\"no\\" or \\"not now\\" to certain features or initiatives, in order to focus on the most impactful ones, is an art and science honed over time. # Conclusion Leveraging two decades of experience as a product owner is about balancing strategic vision with operational excellence. It involves listening, learning, and leading by example. The journey is both challenging and rewarding, filled with opportunities for personal and professional growth. The goal always remains the same: creating products that people love and that drive business success."},{"instruction":"take this list of features and prioritize them from High priority Low priority Low feasibility High feasibility ok","output":"Certainly! However, without a specific list of features provided in your question, I\'ll create a hypothetical list of features for a generic software product to demonstrate how to prioritize them. The prioritization will take into account both the importance to the user or business goals (high or low priority) and the ease or complexity of implementation (high or low feasibility). Here are eight hypothetical features for a productivity app: 1. **Real-time Collaboration Tools**: Allows multiple users to work on documents simultaneously. 2. **Offline Access**: Users can access and edit documents without an internet connection. 3. **Cloud Storage Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with major cloud storage providers. 4. **Advanced Security Features**: Enhanced encryption and security measures to protect user data. 5. **Mobile Access**: A fully functional mobile app that syncs with the desktop version. 6. **Customizable User Interface**: Allow users to customize the layout and appearance of the app. 7. **AI-Based Suggestions**: AI-driven suggestions for improving document quality. 8. **Third-party Plugin Support**: Allow users to install plugins to extend functionality. # Prioritizing: High Priority & High Feasibility - **Offline Access**: Essential for users who need to work in areas without reliable internet connectivity. It\'s relatively straightforward to implement by caching data locally. - **Mobile Access**: With the increasing use of mobile devices, having a mobile app is essential and feasible with today\'s mobile development frameworks. High Priority & Low Feasibility - **Real-time Collaboration Tools**: Critical for teams and collaborative work, yet might be complex to implement due to real-time data syncing and conflict resolution. - **Advanced Security Features**: Non-negotiable for protecting user data but requires significant expertise and time to implement correctly. Low Priority & High Feasibility - **Cloud Storage Integration**: While useful for many users, it might not be as critical as other features. Integration can be relatively easy if cloud providers have well-documented APIs. - **Customizable User Interface**: Nice to have for personalization but not essential for the core functionality of the app. Implementation is straightforward with modern UI frameworks. Low Priority & Low Feasibility - **AI-Based Suggestions**: While innovative and potentially valuable, it involves complex AI development which might not be justifiable given the current user needs. - **Third-party Plugin Support**: Extends functionality but introduces complexity both in implementation and ongoing support, making it less of a priority early on. This framework of prioritization helps in making strategic decisions about where to allocate development resources. It\'s important to continuously revisit and reassess these priorities based on user feedback, technological advances, and business goals."},{"instruction":"take this list of features and prioritize them from High priority, Low priority, Low feasibility , High feasibility , this features of a backend system that manage EV charging solution : Dynamic electricity tariffs: the purchase price for electricity is based on the market price, charging processes are planned accordingly in times of low demand/prices Connect to diverse charging stations with our platform through OCPP integration Easily connect chargers via roaming, directly or through providers like Hubject or Gireve, expanding your network Personalized profiles for tailored recommendations and tracking environmental impact and savings Gamify the experience with badges, rewards, and challenges to encourage sustainable driving habits.

It\'s crucial for sustainability but might be less feasible initially due to the external dependencies and compliance requirements. This prioritization aims to balance immediate, high-impact needs with the technical realities of implementation, providing a roadmap that starts with building a solid, scalable foundation before expanding into more complex but impactful areas."},{"instruction":"香港創新科技署擬於明年 12 月舉辦全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽，藉此激發學生對設計手機應用程式的興趣。假設你們負責該項活動，試撰寫一份計劃書向上司交代整個計劃。計畫書內容包括： 1. 時間(15/12/2025-20/12/2025，每日具體時間: 10:00-16:00) 2. 地點(香港創新科技署) 3. 比賽方式(比賽項目，具體比賽內容，具體安排) 4. 競賽流程(表格詳細說明每日流程，包括具體賽前安排及準備) 你負責寫1-9項，寫1500字。","output":"# 香港創新科技署全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽計劃書 1. 目的 目的在於激發全港學生對於設計手機應用程式的興趣，提高學生們的創新思維及實踐能力，通過比賽挖掘具有潛力的年輕開發者，並為他們提供展示才華的平台。 2. 時間 比賽期間設定於2025年12月15日至2025年12月20日，每日活動時間為10:00-16:00。 3. 地點 本次比賽將在香港創新科技署舉行。 4. 比賽方式 # 比賽項目 1. 創意應用程式設計 2. 用戶體驗設計 3. 技術創新應用 # 具體比賽內容 - 參賽者需提交一款原創手機應用程式，需包含應用概念、設計、功能實現及其創新點。 - 程式可針對任何領域，例如教育、健康、娛樂、日常管理等。 # 具體安排 - 比賽分為初賽、複賽與決賽三個階段。 - 初賽階段：參賽者提交應用程式文檔說明及初步原型。 - 複賽階段：進一步開發，提交可以運行的應用程式版本和詳細的展示。 - 決賽階段：現場演示，包括應用功能展示及回答評委問題。 5. 競賽流程 | 日期 | 時間 | 活動內容 | 備註 | |----------|----------|----------------------|--------------------------| | 2025/12/15 | 10:00-16:00 | 比賽開幕式及技術研討會 | 提供比賽詳情及技術輔導 | | 2025/12/15 | 16:00-16:30 | 初賽階段開始，提交文檔說明 | 參賽者線上提交 | | 2025/12/16 | 10:00-16:00 | 初賽評審工作 | 評委評估及篩選 | | 2025/12/17 | 10:00-16:00 | 複賽階段準備 | 被選中的團隊開始複賽階段的準備 | | 2025/12/18 | 10:00-16:00 | 複賽階段提交 | 提交複賽階段的應用程式 | | 2025/12/19 | 10:00-16:00 | 決賽準備及演示 | 決賽隊伍現場演示及回答評委問題 | | 2025/12/20 | 10:00-14:00 | 最終評審及獎項頒發 | 閉幕式及頒獎 | | 2025/12/20 | 14:00-16:00 | 交流會 | 參賽者與評委、業界人士交流會議 | 6. 賽前安排及準備 # 6.1 註冊與提交 - 所有參賽隊伍需於2025年11月30日前通過官方平台完成報名並提交參賽作品的初步構想。 - 參賽隊伍需提供隊伍信息、參賽成員資料及應用程式概念說明。 # 6.2 技術支持 - 主辦單位將於2025年12月1日至12月14日期間，提供技術咨詢服務。 - 安排線上問答，解答參賽隊伍在應用開發過程中遇到的技術問題。 # 6.3 工作坊和培訓 - 於2025年12月初，組織系列線上和線下的專題講座及工作坊，內容包括最新移動應用開發技術、用戶體驗設計、市場趨勢分析等。 本次比賽旨在提供一個促進學生學習與交流的平台，讓學生們有機會將理論知識實踐於具體項目之中，同時也為學生提供了展示個人才華的舞台，期待所有參賽學生能夠充分發揮創新精神，展現出卓越的應用程式設計。"},{"instruction":"Give me a title for this: I think most of us are afraid in some sense to love and to be completely vulnerable yet despite the risk we long for it. Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I\'ve realized that I have so much love left to give. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special. At my core, I\'m a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear. The capacity to love, even in the face of pain, is one of the most beautiful aspects of being human. It\'s a strength, not a weakness. I\'m sincere in my attempt to forge a connection and hope you are too, I\'d try to share things about me that might give you idea of the person I am. **Essence of Me:** I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions. I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence. I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it\'s a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others. Physical Attributes: - Height: 5\'11\\" (181cm) - Build: Slim - Hair: Deep black, kept in check - Eyes: Light sometimes dark brown :3 - Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed - Complexion: Tanned **Interests:** I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they\'re intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I\'m drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care. To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc **What I Am Looking For:** I\'m in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life\'s myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together. Expectations: - Mutual respect and understanding - Openness and honesty in communication - A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth - An interest in exploring life\'s depths and joys together **The Quest for You:** What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul. I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship. **Epilogue of Hope:** If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you; not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn. Let us begin with a message, instead of resorting to simple hello\'s, take a step of faith with me and share about yourself and your story and may this journey lead to a beautiful relationship.","output":"**Title:** \\"Vulnerability and Strength: An Ode to Love, Growth, and Connection\\""},{"instruction":"I meant for reddit post on r4r","output":"**Title for Reddit r4r Post:** \\"In Search of Genuine Connection: A Tale of Unyielding Love, Laughter, and the Courage to Be Vulnerably Open\\""},{"instruction":"no to give you an example; 24[M4F] Germany/Europe - Longing for love but afraid to make the first move?
