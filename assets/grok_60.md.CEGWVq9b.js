Literally translated, it means \\"the party has flown away,\\" suggesting that the festivity or the mood of celebration has ended or disappeared. In the context provided earlier, where I translated \\"Se me pasó la fiesta\\" as \\"La fête s'est envolée,\\" it was an attempt to capture the essence of the party being over from the speaker's perspective. The original Spanish phrase directly translates to something like \\"the party passed me by\\" or \\"I missed the party,\\" indicating either that the time for celebration is over or that the speaker feels they've lost their opportunity to enjoy it due to perhaps being overly intoxicated or preoccupied. Using \\"s'est envolée\\" in French evokes a vivid image of the party as something light and ephemeral that has literally taken flight and left, providing a poetic way to express that the time for celebration is past. It is not a direct literal translation but an adaptation to convey similar feelings and implications in a manner that feels natural and expressive in French. In translations, especially when dealing with songs or poetry, it's common to find or use expressions that aren't direct equivalents but rather attempt to evoke the same emotions or imagery in the target language."},{"instruction":"\\"Non, non, pas tant d'alcool\\" explain please and make it a detailed breakdown line by line segment by segment part by part in a detailed way of the whole paragraph, and in the parenthesis when you wrote the english version, also add a spanish version","output":"Certainly! Let's break down the French phrase \\"Non, non, pas tant d'alcool\\" piece by piece, providing an explanation in both English and Spanish for each component. --- **Non, non, pas tant d'alcool** **Non, non** - *English*: \\"No, no\\" - *Spanish*: \\"No, no\\" These first two words are direct negations, equivalent in French, English, and Spanish. The repetition emphasizes a strong refusal or disagreement with the previous statement or situation. It’s a straightforward expression used universally in many languages to negate something firmly. **pas** - *English*: \\"not\\" - *Spanish*: \\"no\\" In French, \\"pas\\" is used in negation. When combined with \\"non,\\" it strengthens the negation, making the statement emphatic. In English and Spanish, this concept of double negation to emphasize the refusal may not always directly translate in everyday sentences but is understood in the context of this phrase. **tant** - *English*: \\"so much\\" - *Spanish*: \\"tanto\\" \\"Tant\\" expresses a quantity or degree, often used in comparative forms to discuss the extent or degree of something. When saying \\"pas tant,\\" the idea is to express \\"not so much\\" or \\"not as much,\\" indicating that the amount being discussed is more than desired or necessary. **d'alcool** - *English*: \\"of alcohol\\" - *Spanish*: \\"de alcohol\\" This is a straightforward noun phrase indicating the subject of the negation. \\"d'alcool\\" translates directly to \\"of alcohol\\" in English and \\"de alcohol\\" in Spanish, identifying exactly what the speaker is referring to. The \\"d'\\" is the contraction of \\"de,\\" used before a vowel sound for fluid pronunciation. --- Put together, **\\"Non, non, pas tant d'alcool\\"** effectively communicates a strong refusal or advice against consuming a large amount of alcohol. It's a cautionary statement emphasizing moderation. - *English*: \\"No, no, not so much alcohol.\\" - *Spanish*: \\"No, no, no tanto alcohol.\\" In all three languages, the phrase captures the speaker's disapproval or concern regarding the amount of alcohol either being consumed or suggested. It's a useful phrase for contexts where someone is advocating for moderation or expressing concern about overindulgence."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Episode of the Sweeney (made in 1977)- Carter and Regan is seen snoozing on a couch, the TV is showing static..

But it's not just about catching these crooks...\\" The scene shifts to a conversation between Regan and the formidable yet fair Judge Haskins, who emphasizes the importance of due process, much to Regan's frustration. Haskins, mirroring his 1970's counterpart, is uncompromising in his demand for evidence before any action is taken. **[Interior – Judge Haskins’ Office – Day]** **HASKINS:** \\"Sheriff Regan, while I commend your dedication, we must adhere to the law. Without substantial evidence, there's little I can do.\\" **REGAN:** \\"With all due respect, your honor, sometimes you've got to bend the rules to protect the town.\\" This moral and ethical tug-of-war forms the basis of the episode's conflict, as Regan and Carter find themselves racing against time to gather the evidence needed to prevent the 'Lavender' mob from successfully robbing the stagecoach. **[Exterior – Outskirts of Township – Day]** As the stagecoach's arrival draws near, an intense stand-off unfolds, combining the grit of \\"The Sweeney\\" with the stylistic shootouts of 1970s Westerns.

Despite their initial confusion, their detective instincts remain razor-sharp. **[Scene: Market Square - Day]** Amidst the shouts of street vendors and the clatter of horse-drawn carriages, Regan and Carter are quickly briefed by a concerned citizen about a string of daring robberies targeting the city's goldsmiths. The ghost of their 1970s selves shine through as they take charge with a familiarity that transcends time. **REGAN:** (eyeing the bustling street) \\"Robbers and rascals, eh? Some things never change, no matter the century.\\" **CARTER:** (with a smirk) \\"Except for the fashion, Jack. You pull off a tricorn quite well.\\" **[Mid-Episode: Investigation]** Using their investigative skills, albeit hampered by the lack of modern technology, they start gathering information. They frequent inns, shadowy alleyways, and even a grand masquerade ball in search of leads. Every clue they uncover points to a gang known for their cunning and brutality—the Black Mask Bandits. A pivotal scene unfolds in a dimly lit tavern, where Regan and Carter, through a blend of intimidation and wit, extract crucial information from a nervous informant scared for his life but more scared of the Black Mask Bandits. **[Climax: Showdown at the Goldsmiths]** Word reaches them of a planned heist at one of London's most prominent goldsmiths.

The fight spills into the streets, drawing a crowd eager for spectacle. In the heat of the moment, Regan and Carter leverage their cunning and knowledge of London's labyrinthine alleys to outmaneuver and capture the bandits, showcasing their timeless dedication to justice. **[Dream Ends - Back to Reality]** As the last of the Black Mask Bandits is apprehended, Regan and Carter share a victorious look—only for the scene to blur and fade, the sound of clashing swords replaced by the soft buzz of the television's static.

The scene sets a nostalgic and slightly fantastical mood as the screen fades to black, segueing into the dream about to unfold. **[Opening Scene]** A hazy transition sweeps the viewers from London in 1976 to a bustling Chicago street in the heart of the 1930s Prohibition era. DI Jack Regan and DC George Carter stand on the sidewalk, momentarily disoriented, donning period-appropriate attire — wide-brimmed hats, sharp suits, and trench coats.

They can serve various purposes, such as providing character insight, exploring \\"what if\\" scenarios, or just offering pure entertainment. Here are some imaginative dream sequence episode ideas that could apply broadly across television genres: **1. Time-Travel Adventure:** Characters find themselves in a significant historical event or era. This could range from the building of the Pyramids, the height of the Roman Empire, the dark ages, the renaissance, right up to significant moments in the 20th century. For example, detectives might have to solve a mystery in medieval England or help plan an escape during the French Revolution. **2. Alternate Reality:** The characters wake up in a world where key events in their lives went differently. A failed relationship might have succeeded, a lost job opportunity might have been taken, or a crucial mistake was never made. This can explore how characters might have developed under different circumstances and what truly matters to them. **3. Sci-Fi or Futuristic Scenario:** Jumping forward into a speculative or dystopian future, characters must navigate a world with advanced technology, alien invasions, or post-apocalyptic survival scenarios. An episode could place familiar characters in a future where their city or town is now a space colony facing intergalactic challenges. **4. Fantasy Quest:** Characters are transported into a high fantasy world of magic, mythical creatures, and epic quests. Drawing on classic fantasy tropes, they might be chosen to fulfill a prophecy, with parallels to their real-life roles and relationships. Think of police officers becoming knights on a quest or office workers navigating a magical kingdom using their corporate skills. **5. Superhero Alter Egos:** Characters dream they are superheroes (or villains) with powers that reflect their personalities or desires. This can explore themes of power, responsibility, and wish fulfillment, as well as the comedic potential of learning to use bizarre new abilities. **6. Musicals and Operas:** The episode is presented as a dream where characters find themselves in a world where everyone communicates through song and dance. This can lighten the mood of a series by allowing characters to express hidden feelings or resolve tensions in a highly stylized, musical format. **7. Noir and Mystery:** Drawing heavily from film noir aesthetics and themes, characters could find themselves in a black-and-white world of shadows and intrigue. Detectives could be in a classic detective story, or characters from any genre might find themselves trying to solve a mystery where everyone speaks in period-appropriate slang, complete with trench coats and fedoras. **8. Body Swap:** Characters experience life in each other's shoes, offering a fresh perspective on their relationships and personal challenges. While not a different setting, seeing the world through each other's eyes can be enlightening and humorous. **9. Silent Era:** Characters find themselves in a silent film, with exaggerated expressions, title cards for dialogue, and period-appropriate costumes and settings. This could be an interesting challenge and a creative way to explore non-verbal communication. Each of these dream sequence ideas allows for character development and narrative exploration in a way that breaks from the show's constraints, providing both the characters and audience with innovative and memorable episodes."},{"instruction":"Please suggest 10 possible dream seqeunce scenario ideas for hypothetical episodes of \\"The Sweeeny\\" (apart from those already mentioned as specfic prompts)","output":"Dream sequences in \\"The Sweeney,\\" a show steeped in gritty, realistic action and drama, offer a unique opportunity to explore the fantastical, the historical, or the downright bizarre, while still tethered to the core of its characters and themes.

Their modern policing tactics blend humorously with medieval methods, offering insight into their unyielding pursuit of justice. **2. Space Cops:** In this dream, they're intergalactic law enforcers in the distant future, patrolling the cosmos and dealing with alien criminals.

Cold War Spies:** Transported back to the 1960s, Regan and Carter find themselves as spies embroiled in the Cold War, trading in their police badges for espionage and intrigue in a game of cat and mouse with Soviet agents in foggy London. **4. Wild West Lawmen:** Tasked with bringing order to a lawless frontier town, Regan and Carter must adapt their 20th-century policing skills to the American Wild West, complete with saloon brawls, horseback chases, and showdowns at high noon. **5. Victorian Detectives:** Working under the shadow of Sherlock Holmes, the duo navigates the gas-lit streets of Victorian London, using rudimentary forensic science and keen observation to solve a Jack the Ripper-style mystery. **6. 1920s Gangster Era:** Amid the Prohibition era in the U.S., they're tasked with taking down a powerful bootlegging operation. This setting would see them navigating speakeasies, jazz clubs, and the early days of organized crime. **7. Pirate Buccaneers:** In this swashbuckling adventure, Regan and Carter are pirate hunters in the Caribbean, blending high seas adventure with their relentless pursuit of criminals, treasure maps, and naval battles. **8.

Zombie Apocalypse:** A playful nod to horror films, this scenario sees Regan and Carter waking up to a London overrun by zombies. The episode would mix their hard-nosed crime-fighting with the absurdity of surviving in a post-apocalyptic world. **10. Rock Stars of the '70s:** In a more lighthearted twist, they dream of being rock stars instead of policemen during the height of the 1970s rock scene, dealing with fame, fans, and the peculiar crimes of the music industry, all while performing at iconic venues.

They quickly realize they've entered a world where societal roles have been flipped; women hold the positions traditionally dominated by men in the 1970s, including all roles within the Metropolitan Police. The signage, the attitudes, and the air itself seem to sing a different tune—one of female empowerment and authority. **[Scene: Police Station]** Entering their precinct, they're met not by the usual suspects but by a matriarchy of police officers. The walls adorned with portraits of pioneering women in law enforcement history replace the usual patriarchal decor. Their superior, traditionally Haskins, is now Henrietta \\"Hattie\\" Haskins, a formidable and respected leader, reflecting not just a change in gender but echoing the real challenges and barriers women faced in the Met during the era. **HATTIE:** \\"Regan, Carter, good.

They tackle each case with their usual diligence, albeit with a growing awareness and empathy for the challenges their female counterparts endured. In one particular scene, they go undercover in a male-dominated knitting circle, suspected of being a front for illicit activities. The humor of the situation doesn't obscure its commentary on stereotypes and the undervaluation of traditionally female crafts and industries. **[Climactic Scene: Unveiling the Ring]** Their investigation leads them to a high-stakes fashion show, where the counterfeit ring plans to unveil their latest knock-offs. With precise timing and a newfound understanding of their environment, Regan and Carter orchestrate a dramatic reveal, exposing the ring leaders and restoring balance to the matriarchal society's economy. **REGAN:** (as they lead the culprits away) \\"Seems the other shoe does indeed fit, doesn't it, Carter?\\" **CARTER:** \\"Yeah, and walks just as strongly, Jack.\\" **[Dream Ends - Return to Reality]** The fashion show fades into the buzz of the office fluorescent lights.

Quickly, they are ushered into their day's work, not just tackling traditional crimes but now also 'ideological crimes' — actions and thoughts deemed against the state's prevailing doctrine. **[Scene: Police Briefing]** At the morning briefing, they're introduced by Chief Inspector Harriet Stone, a staunch believer in the new order. She explains the importance of maintaining ideological purity for the greater good. Their first case involves investigating a clandestine group suspected of spreading capitalist propaganda through illegal literature. **CHIEF INSPECTOR STONE:** \\"Comrades, our society thrives on unity and equality.

Whispers of neighbors reporting on one another and forced confessions unsettle them. In a poignant moment, they realize the cost of supposed utopia on individual freedom and expression. In their pursuit, they also uncover a black market dealing not in drugs or weapons, but in banned books and music from the West.

Given Dostoevsky's exploration of psychological, existential, and moral issues against the backdrop of the societal conditions of his time, his works are ideally suited for weaving into the fabric of an episode centered around a utopian socialist London grappling with ideological crimes. Here's how references to Dostoevsky's key works like \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" and Gogol's \\"The Government Inspector\\" could be incorporated: **Crime and Punishment:** - Regan, struggling with the morality of prosecuting ideological crimes, might be seen reading or handling a copy of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" during the episode. This acts as a metaphor for his internal conflict over 'crimes' of thought and the punishment of individuals for their beliefs, mirroring Raskolnikov's struggle with the justifiability of his actions. - A scene could feature a discussion between Regan and Carter where they debate the nature of crime and justice, echoing the philosophical dilemmas faced by Raskolnikov. This could serve as a pivotal moment, highlighting their unease with enforcing the state's harsh measures on ideological dissenters. **The Brothers Karamazov:** - The theme of moral responsibility and the existence of free will under a rigid socialist regime could be reflected through references to \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\" A subplot involving a family torn apart by differing political beliefs could parallel the Karamazov family's ideological and emotional conflicts. - A character resembling Ivan Karamazov, who questions the moral fabric of society and the existence of God, could represent intellectual resistance against the state's imposed ideology, prompting critical conversations between characters about faith, doubt, and the human condition. **The Government Inspector** (by Nikolai Gogol, though not Dostoevsky, it fits well with the theme): - The absurdity and corruption within the utopian society's bureaucracy could draw parallels to \\"The Government Inspector.\\" Scenes showcasing the inefficiency and self-serving nature of officials tasked with rooting out ideological crimes could offer satirical commentary, much like Gogol's play criticizes political corruption in Russia. - A character or scenario directly inspired by \\"The Government Inspector\\" could serve as comic relief while also highlighting the farcical elements inherent in the pursuit of ideological purity. An inspector's visit to assess the precinct's efficiency in combating ideological crimes could spiral into a series of comical and revealing mishaps. Throughout \\"Another Sky,\\" these literary references would not only enrich the narrative with thematic resonance but also provide viewers with a thought-provoking commentary on the nature of authority, morality, and individual autonomy. They would subtly critique the sacrifices made in the name of ideology and the universal quest for a just society, all while remaining grounded in the gritty reality and character dynamics central to \\"The Sweeney.\\""},{"instruction":"No 12.

They exchange puzzled looks, touched by the strange dream's sense of honor and adventure. **[Closing Scene]** With a newfound appreciation for the artistry and discipline of martial arts, Regan and Carter step out into the London night, ready to tackle their reality with the same bravery and honor they displayed in their dream. **REGAN:** \\"You know, Carter, maybe there's something to this martial arts business after all.\\" **CARTER:** \\"Yeah, but let's stick to what we know best. London's got enough excitement for us.\\" As they laugh and walk away, the episode ends, blurring the lines between dream and reality, while subtly reflecting on the universal themes of justice and valor, all wrapped in the exotic allure of 1970s Hong Kong cinema. **[End Credits]**"},{"instruction":"No 14.

The park, which operated from 1978 to 1996 (and later reopened under new ownership and names), gained a reputation for its poorly designed, unsafe rides, as well as a lack of supervision and training for staff. It was known colloquially as \\"Traction Park,\\" \\"Accident Park,\\" and \\"Class Action Park\\" due to the high frequency of injuries and fatalities that occurred there. The Tarzan Swing was a simple yet thrilling ride that allowed guests to experience a moment of free fall before splashing into water. Specifically, it consisted of a large, rope swing hung from a metal arch. Participants would climb up to a platform, grab the rope, and then swing out over a spring-fed pool. At the apex of the swing, they would let go and plunge into the water below. The pool was notoriously cold, often taking swimmers by surprise with its frigid temperatures, which added to the shock and excitement of the experience. Despite the ride's simplicity, the Tarzan Swing could be dangerous. Timing the release from the swing was crucial; releasing too early or too late could result in an awkward fall or collision with the water at an unsafe angle. Furthermore, the pool was open to other swimmers, raising the possibility of collision with someone already in the water. The Tarzan Swing epitomized the alluring yet perilous nature of Action Park's attractions. It combined the thrill of risk-taking with a minimal safety net, reflecting the park's overall philosophy that emphasized guest freedom and adventure, often at the expense of safety protocols and regulations."},{"instruction":"Note: This is in an alternate universe, This shop, despite being awesome, never existed, It does in this alternate universe, Also sorry for constantly showing you this, I’m just trying to make sure its perfect We’ve loved being in this spot as part of the wonderful Glasgow community Unfortunately, This shop is now closed, The realities of retail in the shopping landscape has made this decision unavoidable, We want to take the opportunity to thank you for shopping with us for so many years, You can find all about KikoRiki and its related online MMO RolyPolyLand at riki.com Goodbye forever… This sign was posted to the doors of Riki, a children’s shop in Glasgow on Wednesday The image ends with a poignant “Goodbye forever…” above a image of a crying Krash the Rabbit The store closed on Wedensday after 12 years trading at Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow The shop sold merchandise related to the animated series KikoRiki, The cartoon is a Russian cartoon about circular colorful animals and their fun adventures, The Riki shop opened in 1995 was originally Golden Adventures and was a general toy shop akin to Toys R Us but in 2003 became Riki and became focused on the then new surge in KikoRiki popularity in Scotland, However in June 2007, the store closed for the last time, Riki Group’s reasoning was the “realities of retail” was unavoidable, The shop was also closed so Riki could focus on business in it’s native Russia and develop more exciting new animated series or movies Hidden Glasgow - Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion.

Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show.

Cassie, Bowie's fellow presenter, playfully announces that if he doesn't return in four days, she might just have to step in and take over the show herself. And true to her word, when the fourth day rolls around and Bowie is still soaking up the sun on holiday, Cassie takes the reins with a surprise musical performance. With a mischievous glint in her eye, Cassie breaks into a parody of Elton John's \\"Rocketman,\\" playfully altering the lyrics to reflect Bowie's extended holiday. As the studio fills with laughter and the catchy tune of Cassie's rendition, listeners can't help but smile at the playful homage to their absent host. The performance is both a lighthearted jab at Bowie's prolonged vacation and a testament to the camaraderie and fun that defines the Clyde 1 team. As the last notes of Cassie's impromptu performance ring out, she quips, \\"It's gonna be a long, long time before he comes back to the studio. But until then, we'll keep the music playing and the laughter flowing. George, we'll see you when you return!\\" And so, as Bowie enjoys his well-deserved break, the Clyde 1 studio resonates with the echoes of Cassie's musical send-off, a reminder that even in his absence, the spirit of fun and camaraderie that defines the Clyde 1 team remains strong.

5「交差点」規定について 資本は特有な機構をもって本来商品ではない労働力の商品化を確保するが、このことは資本がその自律的運動において労働日を決定するメカニズムを有していることを意味している。ゆえに以下では労働日規定の体系的考察が問題となる。 すでに資本主義的生産の解明に際し、一定の長さの労働日を所与として前提しうることを明らかにしたが、労働日における必要労働時間と剰余労働時間との比率こそ、いわゆる剰余価值率として資本家と労働者の基本的関係を表示するものである。もちろん資本家は労働者に対する関係を直接そのように意識するものではないが、資本家的生産方法は結局この剰余価値率の増進を動力として発展する。そしてそれはまず必要労働時間を超過する剰余労働時間の増進、すなわち絶対的剰余価值の生産として現われるのである。この方法は一般に所与の生産方法を基礎として行われる剩余価值率の增進として実現されるのであって、それ自身新たな生産方法を展開するものではない。いわば労働日の延長ないし労働の強化よって剰余価値率を増進するのである。 だが元来、他人の剰余労働の獲得は資本主義に固有なものではない。アテネの貴族、ノルマンの領主、ワラキアのボヤールなどの指摘をまつまでもなく、階級的関係はいずれもそれを基礎にしている。ただ資本家的商品経済は、他の社会と異なり、労働力の消費に際し、剰余労働を剰余価值として無限に追求する傾向を有する。しかし資本主義的生産の剰余労働へのこの人狼的渴望は、他面労働力の消費に纏わる固有な制限から自由であることはできない。資本は労働生産過程の包摂により同時に社会的実体からする制約を内部化せざるをえなくなるのであって、労働力の無際限な消費は制限されざるをえない。 ととろが剰余価値総量は可変資本総量によって規定されるのであって、無限の価値増殖を目標とする資本は、その限界を労働者の雇用の増大によりカパーしようとする。しかしそれはまた、労働力ヘの需要を增加し、労働市場を緊迫化するだけである。絕対的剩余価值の生産は、価值増殖の唯一の方法ではないととが明らかになる。それは限定された範囲のなかで行われうるにすぎず、価值增殖もこの方法にとどまるかぎり、発展性のない一定の限度を有するものにすぎない。こうして一定の労働日の下で、必要労働時間を減少させることにより、剰余価値の生産が展開されることになる。この方法は、特別剰余価値の生産をその契機としていることからも明らかのように、資本主義的生産方法を不断に改良·発達させることにおいて実現される。 しかしとの相対的剩余価值の生産は、絶対的剰余価值の生産を否定するものではない。一般には労働の生産力の発展は、労働を節約·軽減するが、機械の資本家的使用はむしろ労働日の延長、労働の強化を助長し、絕対的剩余価値の生産を推進することになる。なぜなら機械の充用には、「一つの内在的矛盾が蔵されている」からである。機械の採用による剰余価值率の增進は、他面では労働者数の減少による剰余価値量の低下をもたらすのであって、このことが資本に相対的剰余価値の生産と並行して絶対的剰余価値の生産を継続させるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"虽然我对①没有异议，但②可能存在问题。在生产理论中，价值与实体之间的对应关系是以劳动日理论为基础，并在再生产模式中最终确认的。也就是说，劳动日的边际规定意味着即使是剩余劳动部分也在一种间接形式下受到实质性的调控，换句话说，价值生成过程论中的价值关系可以维持不变，并不直接意味着量的差异。教授自己在③中也提到了偏差的修正，但是导致偏差的剩余产品对社会需求的不确定性，即最终产品作为劳动者生活资料的生产序列与“完全不同序列的生产过程组织”中的剩余产物，在生产理论层面上从一开始就不是问题。即使通过个别资本的关系来看，资本家也是在与劳动者的整体关系中被讨论的。尽管个别上价值与实体之间的关系可能包含了偏差，但价值增长过程论是以它们的对应为前提的，并非是“需要确认偏差的地方”。正如④中明显指出的，教授的主张似乎只是将生产价格理论的问题预先解决，并将其错误地引入到生产理论中的价值法则中。 关于“交叉路口”的规定： 资本通过其特有机制确保了本质上不是商品的劳动力的商品化，这意味着资本拥有决定劳动日的机制。因此，以下将对劳动日规定的系统性考察成为问题。 在解释资本主义生产时，已经明确了可以假设一个确定长度的劳动日，劳动日中必要劳动时间与剩余劳动时间的比率正展示了资本家和劳动者的基本关系，即所谓的剩余价值率。当然，资本家并不会直接以这样的关系意识对待劳动者，但资本家生产方式最终是以提高剩余价值率为动力发展的。首先，它表现为必要劳动时间之外的剩余劳动时间的增加，即绝对剩余价值的生产。这个方法通常是在给定的生产方式的基础上实现的剩余价值率的提高，并不是展开新的生产方式。也就是通过延长劳动日或加强劳动来提高剩余价值率。 然而，获取他人剩余労动并非资本主义所特有。雅典贵族、诺曼领主、瓦拉几亚的波雅尔等的指出并不是必要的，所有的阶级关系都是基于此。但与其他社会不同，资本主义商品经济有在劳动力消费时无限追求剩余劳动即剩余价值的倾向。然而，资本主义生产对剩余劳动的这种狼人般的渴望，另一方面不能摆脱消费劳动力所固有的限制。资本通过包容劳动生产过程，同时内化来自社会实体的限制，因此劳动力的无限消费是不可能的。 剩余价值总量是由可变资本总量决定的，追求无限价值增长的资本通过增加工人雇用来尝试克服这一限制。然而，这也只是加剧了对劳动力的需求，加剧了劳动市场的紧张。生产绝对剩余价值并非增长价值的唯一方法，它被证明仅在有限范围内进行，并且价值增长如果仅限于这种方法，其发展性就有一定的局限性。因此，在一定的劳动日下，通过减少必要劳动时间来扩展剩余价值的生产。从特殊剩余价值的生产成为其契机，这明显是在不断改进发展资本主义生产方式中实现的。 然而，相对剩余价值的生产并不否定绝对剩余价值的生产。一般来说，劳动生产力的发展是节约和减少劳动，但机械的资本家使用反而促进了劳动日的延长、劳动的加强，并推动了绝对剩余价值的生产。这是因为机械的使用包含了一个“内在矛盾”。机械的采用提高了剩余价值率，但另一方面，由于工人数量的减少，也导致了剩余价值量的降低，这促使资本家在相对剩余价值生产的同时继续进行绝对剩余价值生产。"},{"instruction":"请将“こうして機械的経営は労働力の一層貪婪な消費を惹起するが、これは一定の客観的根拠をもって要請されることにもなる。まず第一に、機械の採用は、物質的および道徳的摩損から、その間断なき運転を利益とすることになり、それが長時間労働と労働の強化を必然化する（交替制と夜間労働の一般化）。更に第二に特別剰余価値のえられる期間を十分に利用するためにも、機械の運転速度を早めることが重要となる。そして最後に、かかる絶対的剰余価値生産ヘの新たな動機は、機械制工業の確立による相対的過剩人口の形成により、社会的にも可能とされるのである。 では一体、機械制工業の確立に伴う強搾取の展開において、労働日の延長と労働の強化は、労働力の消費において、如何なる関連を有することになるか。両者が個々的には、資本の価值増殖にたいし一定の限度を有していることはすでにみたとおりであるが、ここではすすんで両者の関連が、すなわち労働力の使用価値規定の内部関連が問われることになるのである。 マルクスは『資本論』第一卷第四篇第十三章第三節「機械経営が労働者に及ぼす直接的影響」で、これを次のように說明していた。「機械使用の進展と、機械労働者という一つの独特な階級の経験の堆積とにつれて、労働の速度が、したがってまたその強度が自然発生的に増大するということは、自明である。·······しかし、だれにもわかるように、······每日くり返される規則的な均等性をもって労働が行なわれなければならない場合には、必ず一つの交差点 Knotenpunkt が現われて、そこでは労働日の長さと労働の強度とが互いに排除し合」（『資本論1』、五三四頁）うととになる、と。すなわち機械体系は、一方で労働日を延長し、他方で機械の運転速度の増加や労働者一人当りの作業範囲の拡大により「労働時間の気孔のいっそう濃密な充塡」をもたらすが、両者への同時的な欲求には必ず「交差点」が現われ、「力の発揮の持続という点で失われるものが、カの発揮の度合いという点で得られる」（同、五三六頁）という関係が出現する。そとでは、労働の作用能力（＝労働の強度）はその作用時間（＝労働日の長さ）に反比例するというのである。マルクスのこの「交差点」規定は、鋭くかつ正しい指摘といわなければならない。機械制工場の確立は、たしかに労働力を単純化し、熟練·複雜労働を解体することにより、労働に「くり返される規則的な均等性」を付与するのであって、工場労働においてのみ労働力の使用価値の内的関連が明白にされると思われるからである では「交差点」の存在は、一体何を根拠にして定立されるのか。結論的にいえば、労働生産過程における労働力の使用とその再生産の固有な構造に、その根拠を有していよう。人間は自己の労働力を対象化して種々なる有用財を生産する一方、その労働の生産物たる一定量の生活資料を消費して労働力の再生産をなす。このサイクルの継続なくして人間と自然との物質代謝は不可能である。そしてそこには、それ以上の過度労働は労働力の再生産を不可能にするという労働力の使用の限度が存する。それをこえて労働日および労働の強度を延長·強化した場合には、いくら生活資料の範囲を拡大しても、消費生活で正常な形での労働力の回復·再生産が不可能となる限界点が存するのである。この限度を之えた場合には、労働能率の低下が生ずるばかりか、労働疲労の堆積から労働者の肉体的退化·多様な身体的苦痛、早期死亡の傾向が生じ、人間社会の存立さえ危ぅくなる。ゆえにそのような場合汇は、労働日と労働の強度は、相互汇反発して限界的な総労働支出を超過せぬよう調整されるのであつて、両者のかかる交差によって、経済原則の実現も可能とされるのである。「交差点」とは、経済原則的な制限が、資本主義的形態において発現したものにほかならない。これを踏みはずしては、資本主義といえども一歴史社会体制として自立できないのである。産業資本は労働力の消費に際し、労働の外延的·内包的拡大を同時的にか無際限に実現することはできない。労働力商品化の矛盾は、労働日では、無制限な価值増殖への欲求にたいするシュランケの規制という形で発現するが、「交差点」規定における労働日と労働の強度の相互排他性＝反比例性はその一発展形態とみなしうる。つまり資本はある限度に達すると、価值增殖において二兎を追うことができなくなるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"因此，机械化管理会引起对劳动力更加贪婪的消费，这也是基于一定的客观基础而提出的要求。首先，机械的采用因物质和道德上的磨损，而使得其连续运转变得有利，这必然导致劳动时间的延长和劳动强度的加强（轮班制和夜间工作的普及）。其次，为了充分利用获取特殊剩余价值的期间，加速机械的运转速度也变得重要。最后，这种对绝对剩余价值生产的新动机，通过机械制工业的确立以及相对过剩人口的形成，社会上也成为可能。 那么，随着机械制工业的确立和榨取强化的展开，劳动日的延长和劳动强度的加强，在劳动力消费中将如何相关联呢？虽然我们已经看到，这两者在个别方面对资本的价值增殖有一定的限制，但在这里，二者的联系，即劳动力的使用价值规定的内部联系将被探讨。 马克思在《资本论》第一卷第四部分第十三章第三节“机械管理对工人的直接影响”中，是这样解释的：“随着机械使用的进展和作为一个独特阶级的机械工人经验的积累，劳动的速度以及因此其强度自然增大，这是显而易见的...但是，正如人人所知，如果要求劳动必须以每日重复的规则均匀性进行的话，就必然会出现一个‘交叉点’，在这里劳动日的长度和劳动的强度相互排斥。”（《资本论1》，第534页）。也就是说，机械体系一方面延长劳动日，另一方面通过增加机械的运转速度和扩大每个工人的作业范围来“使劳动时间的间隙更加密集填充”，对这两者的同时追求必定会出现“交叉点”，在这里，“失去的在力的发挥持续方面得到的，将在力的发挥程度方面得到”（同，第536页）。也就是说，劳动的作用能力（=劳动强度）与其作用时间（=劳动日长度）成反比。马克思的这一“交叉点”规定，必须说是一个敏锐且正确的指出。机械制工厂的确立，确实通过简化劳动力，解体熟练·复杂劳动，为劳动赋予“重复的规则均匀性”，仅在工厂劳动中才使劳动力的使用价值的内在联系变得明确，因而认为如此。 那么，“交叉点”的存在是基于什么而确立的呢？最后可以说，它的根据存在于劳动生产过程中劳动力的使用及其再生产的固有结构中。人类一方面将自己的劳动力具体化来生产各种有用的财物，另一方面消费一定量的生活资料来进行劳动力的再生产。没有这个循环的持续，人类和自然之间的物质代谢是不可能的。而在这里，存在着一个极限，即超过一定程度的过度劳动将使劳动力的再生产变得不可能。如果超出这个限度延长劳动日和劳动强度的话，无论如何扩大生活资料的范围，都存在一个无法以正常形式恢复·再生产劳动力的极限点。超过这个限度的情况下，不仅会导致劳动效率的降低，还会因劳动疲劳的积累导致工人的身体退化、各种身体痛苦、早死的趋势，甚至威胁到人类社会的存在。因此，在这种情况下，劳动日和劳动强度将相互排斥，以便调整不超过限制性的总劳动支出，通过这种交叉，经济原则的实现也成为可能。“交叉点”不过是经济原则性的限制在资本主义形态下的表现。如果违背这一点，即使是资本主义也不能作为一个历史社会体系自立。产业资本在消费劳动力时，不能同时无限地实现劳动的外延性·内含性扩张。劳动力商品化的矛盾，在劳动日中以对无限价值增殖欲望的施鲁蓝格的限制形式表现出来，“交叉点”规定中劳动日和劳动强度的相互排斥性=反比例性可以被视为其一发展形态。也就是说，资本达到一定限度后，就不能在价值增殖中追求两者了。"},{"instruction":"请将“ただしここには三点ほど留意すべき問題があろう。第一点は、「交差点」規定が、一見すると、資本主義にのみ特有なものとして現象することである。労働の「規則的均等性」が、資本主義的生産における機械制工場の確立をまってはじめて与えられるからである。また機械制工場のもとでは資本が労働力の消費を容易にかつ継続的に「交差点」にひき寄せることができるが、経済外的強制による他の社会ではそうはいかない。瞬過的にはともかく、そこには「交差点」にひき寄せる客観的機構が存在しないからであって、これが「交差点」を資本主義に固有なものとして仮象させることにもなる。だがこのことは「交差点」が資本主義に固有であることを意味しない。「交差点」規定は資本家的生産方法の発展をまって明確にされるというにすぎない。それが発現する根拠は、あくまでも労働力の使用とその再生産の原則的な関連に存するのである。 第二点は「交差点」の位置の問題である。労働日と労働の強度が交差する点は、社会形態に応じて、また資本主義の発展段階に応じて、諸々異なろう。一般的には、それは歴史をくだるにしたがって、その長さと強度を増し、最後の階級社会たる資本主義で頂点に達するとみてよい。労働の生産力と生活水準の歴史的向上が、労働の潜勢力を開発·発展させ、限界的な総労働支出の増大を可能にするばかりか、資本主義的な階級関係は、労働力の貪婪かつ合理的な消費により、それを現実化しかつ極限にまで推し進めるからである。実際、原蓄期の労働立法や労役場制度による強制的な無産者の陶冶と訓練、産業革命期の工場制度における労働日延長と労働強化の同時的促進という事実は、このことを明白に物語っている。 第三点は、機械制工場の確立と相対的剰余価値の生産システムの完成は、必ずしも「交差点」規定の恒常的な作用を意味するものではないということである。理論的にはそれは、労働市場が買手市場で、労働者が劣悪な雇用条件を受入れざるをえない場合にのみ機能すると考えなければならない。マルクスのように窮乏化法則をとく場合には「交差点」規定は恒常的に機能することにもなろう。しかしそれはイギリス産業資本の一面の現状を反映するとはいえ、原理的には正しくない。好況期から過剰人ロのプールが払底する最好況期にかけては、労働市場が売手市場化し雇用条件が改善されるので、「交差点」規定は作用しない。むしろそこでは資本家は、労働力の消費をなんとか「交差点」に近づけようど、労働日延長と労働強化を同時に追求するのである。 剩余価值率の增進を目標とする資本家的生産方法の発展は、労働日の長さ、労働の強度、労働の生産力の三要因の種々なる変動のもとにこれを実現してきた。この三要因の変動による資本家と労働者との関係の変化を取り扱う固有の剰余価值論の次元では、もはや労働日を、労働の強度との関連を捨象してそれ自身で考察するわけにはいかない。労働力の使用価值規定に関わる両者の相互関連が問われるのである。「交差点」規定は、一定の条件のもとで、労働日の長さが、労働の強度に反比例することを明示している点で重要である。 （1）マルクスは、労働日の延長の限界を、工場法による労働日規制で說明しているが、それは歴史的叙述としてはともかく理論的說明としては問題があろう。たしかに綿業資本は“Long Hours”がもたらす社会的結果に無頓着なまま強搾取を展開した。そしてその濫奪の激しさが、労働運動の展開を契機づけ、ついには工場法という形での国家の経済過程への部分的干渉をうむことにもなった（それは、成年男子工が規制外とされたので、レッセ·フェールに抵触はしなかったが）。だが、産業資本は、工場法の成立にはいわゆるリレー制をもって、労働者の経済的要求には高蓄積と労働条件の改善をもって歴史的に対処したのであって、そこにかかる一連の諸契機を捨象しうる根拠がある。労働日延長の限界は、理論的には労働力商品化の矛盾から規定されなければならない。当時の時間短縮運動や工場法は原理の貫徹を保障する外枠として機能したとみなしうるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"但在这里，应注意到三个问题。首先，“交叉点”规定似乎在一定程度上特有于资本主义现象。这是因为劳动的“规则均等性”是随着资本主义生产中机械制工厂的建立而首次赋予的。而在机械制工厂中，资本可以更容易且持续地将劳动力消费拉向“交叉点”，但在其他社会中通过经济外的强制手段则不尽如人意。尽管短暂地也许可行，但那里不存在将其拉向“交叉点”的客观机制，这也导致“交叉点”被视为资本主义所特有。但这并不意味着“交叉点”仅属于资本主义。“交叉点”规定仅是在资本家生产方式的发展中被明确的。其表现的基础，归根结底在于劳动力的使用及其再生产的基本联系中。 第二个问题涉及“交叉点”的位置。劳动日和劳动强度的交叉点，根据社会形态及资本主义的发展阶段，可能会有所不同。普遍看来，随着历史的进程，它们的长度和强度都将增加，在最后的阶级社会资本主义中达到顶点。劳动生产力和生活水平的历史性提高，不仅开发和发展了劳动的潜力，还使得限制性总劳动支出的增加成为可能，而资本主义的阶级关系通过对劳动力的贪婪而理性的消费，实现并推向极限。实际上，早期积累时期的劳动立法和劳役场制度对无产者的强制训练，以及工业革命期间工厂制度下劳动日延长与劳动强化的同时促进，清楚地证实了这一点。 第三点是，机械制工厂的建立和相对剩余价值的生产系统的完善，并不必然意味着“交叉点”规定的持续作用。理论上，这一规定仅在劳动市场为买方市场且劳动者不得不接受恶劣的雇佣条件时才会起作用。如果像马克思讨论的贫困化规律那样，“交叉点”规定将持续起作用。然而，尽管这反映了英国产业资本的某一方面现状，从原理上讲并不准确。从繁荣期到过剩人口池耗尽的最佳状态期间，劳动市场变为卖方市场且雇佣条件得以改善，“交叉点”规定不起作用。相反，在这种情况下，资本家努力将劳动力消费拉向“交叉点”，同时追求劳动日延长和劳动强化。 以提高剩余价值率为目标的资本家生产方式的发展，在劳动日的长度、劳动的强度、劳动生产力的各种变化下实现了这一目标。在这些因素变化引起的资本家与劳动者关系变化的特定剩余价值论的维度中，不再可能仅将劳动日及其与劳动强度的联系简单考虑。它要求考虑二者之间的相互关系。“交叉点”规定的重要性在于，在一定条件下，它明确了劳动日的长度与劳动强度呈反比关系。 （1）马克思通过工厂法中的劳动日规定来解释劳动日延长的限制，这或许在历史叙述上是可行的，但作为理论解释则有其问题。的确，棉纺资本对于“长小时”带来的社会后果漠不关心地展开了强榨取。而这种榨取的激烈，触发了劳动运动的展开，最终导致了国家对经济过程的部分干预，即通过工厂法（尽管这样做并未涉及成年男性工人，因此并不违反自由放任原则）。然而，产业资本通过所谓的轮换制度对工人的经济需求做出了历史性应对，并通过高积累和劳动条件的改善进行了处理，因此存在一系列这样的历史契机可以被忽略。劳动日延长的限制，在理论上必须由劳动力商品化的矛盾来规定。当时的时间缩短运动和工厂法可以被视为原则实施的外部框架。"},{"instruction":"请将“（2）「交差点」理論は通常いわゆる最適労働時間論に擬せられる。それは、長時間労働はかえって労働力の再生産と発展を阻害し労働能率を低下させるという事実に着目し、一定時間内で労働力から最大限の効用をえるには、労働の生産力に応じた適正労働時間があることを主張している。しかしこの「労働科学」は次の三点でェセ科学である。そのプルジョア的性格。適正労働時間とは労働の生産力を一定とした場合、産出量を極大化するのに最適な労働時間であって、その主張は一定の条件の下でしか機能しない「交差点」の存在を常態化させかねない。適正という概念自体、資本の立場にもとづくそれでしかないのである。回その方法的欠陥。最適労働時間は立論の仕方がきわめて便宜的なものである。イギリス産業資本は、たしかに労働運動や工場法により労働日延長に一定の制約をうけたが、それにたいしては一層の生産方法の改善と労働の強化をもつてとたえた。ゆえに産出量や利潤量は低下しなかったのである。最適労働時間論は、このような歴史的事実に学び、その関連を経験論的·結果論的に整合化せんとするものにほかならない。先の労働日は必ずしも最適ではなかった、現在のよう短い労働日の方が効率的だ、といった具合に。四）その階級的機能。労働日は現実には各企業·各産業で様々な事情（＝階級情勢、労働市場の動向など）により左右されるので、L·G レイノルズさえ認めているように、最適労働時間が抽出されてもめったに採用されない。「労働科学」はこの点でも机上の空論にほかならない。それはせいぜい一部の資本家に合理的な強搾取を促すか、社会的に労働力を保全し階級関係を維持する機能をはたしているにすぎない。 それゆえ、マルクスの「交差点」規定を「最適労働時間論の一種」に入れることはできない。それは、没落期の資本主義の資本·賃金労働関係を科学的偽装のもとに側面から擁護するプルジョア弁護論にほかならないのである。 （3）かかる事態が歷史的に存在したことは否定できない。古代、中世でも、人間の家畜化＝消耗品化はみられた。マルクスも「レグレマン··オルガニク」にふれて、苛酷な過度労働の事実を指摘している。しかしそれは、社会的には部分的な、歴史的には一過的なものにすぎなかった。 （4）この「交差点」規定が恒常的に機能するという視点にたって、労働日の短縮化傾向が說かれている。その論理には大きく分けて、次の三つのタイプがあろう。

いずれも産業資本段階以後の労働日の歴史的な短縮化傾向を、原理から直接說明しようとしている点では、同一の立脚点にたっていよう。だがまず第一に、かかる立論は、時間短縮の「事実」把握に問題がある。というのは独占段階を含めて、それは大企業の組織労働者には一般的にいえても、未組織の中小企業労働者、自営、農民層の労働者をも含めた場合、そう簡単にいえるか、疑問である。また先進国が国民的規模で労働条件の改善を享受しうる場合にも、そのつけは資本の世界市場支配により、後進国や植民地に回されているかもしれない。第二に、時間短縮は、単に経済的要因だけではなく、労働組合運動·団体協約や国家の労働政策といった多くの経済外的要因によって左右されるのであって、それを原理的に追求するのは、経済決定論のそしりを免れえない。”翻译为中文","output":"（2）“交叉点”理论通常被比作所谓的最佳劳动时间论。这关注到长时间劳动反而会阻碍劳动力的再生产和发展，降低劳动效率这一事实，并主张存在一个根据劳动生产力确定的适当劳动时间，在该时间内从劳动力中获得最大限度的效用。然而，“劳动科学”在以下三点上是假科学。其资产阶级的性质。适当劳动时间，在生产力一定的条件下，是使产出量最大化的最佳劳动时间，这一论点可能常态化“交叉点”的存在，而该存在仅在一定条件下起作用。“适当”这一概念本身基于资本的立场而已。其方法上的缺陷。最佳劳动时间的论证方式极为便利。英国产业资本确实受到了劳动运动和工厂法的一定限制，但面对这些限制，通过更进一步的生产方法改进和加强劳动，因此产出量和利润并未下降。最佳劳动时间论试图从这些历史事实中学习，并试图经验性地、结果论地整合这些关系。比如，先前的劳动日并不一定是最佳的，而像现在这样短的劳动日更为高效等等。其阶级功能。实际上，劳动日受到各个公司、各个行业的各种情况（=阶级情况、劳动市场趋势等）的影响，正如L·G Reynolds所承认，即使提出了最佳劳动时间，也很少被采用。“劳动科学”在这一点上也不过是空中楼阁。它顶多只能促使一部分资本家进行理性的榨取，或在社会上保持劳动力和维持阶级关系的功能而已。 因此，不能将马克思的“交叉点”规定归入“最佳劳动时间论”的范畴。它不过是资本主义没落期下，资本-工资劳动关系的科学伪装以及资产阶级辩护论的侧面支持而已。 （3）这种情况在历史上的确存在，无法否认。在古代、中世纪，也见过人的家畜化=消耗品化现象。马克思在提到“Mechanization Organic”时，也指出了严酷的过度劳动现象。但这在社会上是部分的，在历史上是暂时的。 （4）从“交叉点”规定持续起作用的视角来看，劳动日缩短的趋势被讨论。其逻辑大致可以分为以下三种类型： 1. 从资本有机构成的不断高度化中引导劳动强化，并从“交叉点”规定中推导出劳动日的缩短。 2. 同上述论点相同，但是从固定资本更新的萧条期的集中的角度看，通过景气循环周期呈现出来，解释为长期趋势的劳动日缩短。 3. 给“交叉点”理论加上劳动者生活水平提高→日常生活时间增加→劳动日缩短的逻辑，或高度机械化→劳动者的教育、智力水平现代化→生活时间部分的增加的逻辑，将两者结合来论述时间缩短的必然性。 这些都从原理出发试图直接说明工业资本阶段之后劳动日的历史性缩短趋势。但首先，这种论证存在一个问题，即对时间缩短的“事实”把握。包括垄断阶段在内，这可能普遍适用于大企业的组织工人，但包括未组织的中小企业工人、自雇者、农民层的劳动者在内，是否就这么简单，值得怀疑。此外，即使发达国家能够在国家层面享受劳动条件的改善，其代价可能已经通过资本的全球市场支配转嫁给了发展中国家和殖民地。其次，时间缩短不仅受经济因素影响，还受到劳工联盟运动、集体协定和国家劳动政策等许多经济外因素的影响，从原理上追求这一点，难以避免经济决定论的指责。"},{"instruction":"请将“（1）は、有機的構成が不断に高度化するように考えている点で疑問である。固定資本の制約の問題が看過されてしまっているのである。③）の（ロ）は、労働者が機械を使用するのではなく、機械が労働者を使用するという事態をつかんでいないのではないか。たしかに資本主義の発展は、義務教育を制度化し、中·高等教育をも発展させるが、そのことは直接工場労働者の生活時間を増大させるわけではない。したがって2と③の（イ）が問題になるが、いずれも「交差点」が恒常的に機能するかの如くみなしている点で問題が残る。好況期にも「交差点」が機能するというのはいささか無理な想定ではあるまいか。不況期の生産方法の改良が物質的土台となって景気サイクル毎に労働者の生活水準（＝中位の活況期のそれで画されよう）が向上していくというのは正しい。そしてそれは一般的には、労働者の生活時間の増大→労働日の短縮に表現されると考えてよいが、前のサイクルと比較して必ず労働日が短縮するとはいえない。労働日は労働の強度との相関で決定されるのであって、前の好況期に労働の強度がそれほど軽減されず労働日の方が短縮され、今期は逆傾向にあるような場合には、労働日の短縮を一義的にいうのはむずかしい。このことは、生活水準の向上が、労働者の生活時間の増大によるばかりではなく、生活資料の範囲の拡大によってもある程度可能であるということからも窺えよう。生活水準の向上は必ずしも家計を中心的に担う成年男子工の生活時間を増大させるとはかぎらないのである。 （5）労働日、労働の強度および労働の生産力の関連については第一卷第五篇第十五章「労働力の価格と剰余価值との量的変動」を参照。ただ、そこでのマルクスの三者の組み合わせはいささか乱暴である。「労働の生産力が低下して同時に労働日が延長される場合」など不要であろう。 6 労働日の決定メカニズムの解明 （1）蓄積論的アプローチ 労働日のグレンツェは、資本の論理において決定される。この決定機構を解明するためにはまず資本の蓄積過程が究明されねばならない。 マルクスは第一卷第七篇第二三章「資本主義的蓄積の一般的法則」、資本蓄積の二類型-資本の有機的構成が不変な場合、いわゆる横の拡大。構成の高度化を伴う場合、いわゆる縦の拡大-を析出しつつ、近代的景気循環の基礎は、相对的過剩人口の形成と吸収の独特な機構があることを說いている。「近代産業の特徵的な生活過程、すなわち中位の活況、生産の繁忙、恐慌、沈滞の各時期が、より小さい諸変動に中断されながら、一0年ごとの循環をなしている形態は、産業予備軍または過剩人口の不断の形成、その大なり小なりの吸収、そしてその再形成にもとづいている」（資本論1』、マル·エン全集②b、八二四頁）というのである。 だがマルクスにあっては、後者の類型が一般化され、産業予備軍が累進的に形成されるかの如く考えられたので、過剩人口の形成·吸引のシステムがいわゆる窮乏化法則に矮少化され、それが景気の各局面との関連で正確に把握されなかった。マルクスの人口法則論の欠陥は、前者の類型の蓄積が恐慌によらずして人為的に労賃の高騰を処理できるかのようにとく論点（＝労働力の過度な物化による資本支配の過大評価）や後者の類型の蓄積の一般化（＝固定資本の制約性の無視）に表現されていよう。そこにはたんに「資本の流通過程」論の媒介性の軽視というにとどまらず、労働力商品の特殊性に関する把握の不備が存した。労働市場の動向は、たしかに資本蓄積の進展具合に規制されるといってよいが、蓄積の大きさが「独立変数」であることは、資本がその需給関係を自由に調整できることを意味しない。資本は労働力を他の一般商品のようには決して生産できないのであって、過剰人口の形成·吸引の特有な機構の形成においてそれを商品として確保するというにすぎない。資本主義に特有なる人口法則の展開により、かろうじて労働力商品化の矛盾を現実的に解決できるのである。またそのような機能をはたしているからこそ、人口法則という独自なシステムは、周期的にくりかえす景気循環の基礎過程たりえるわけである。以下、かかる視角からマルクス蓄積論の再構成を図る。”翻译为中文","output":"（1）对于不断提高的有机构成的考虑是有问题的。忽视了固定资本的制约问题。而在（3）的（b）中，是否未把握到不是劳动者使用机械，而是机械使用劳动者这一情况。的确，资本主义的发展制度化了义务教育，并发展了中高等教育，但这并不直接增加工厂劳动者的生活时间。因此，虽然问题出在2和（3）的（a）上，但它们都把“交叉点”视为恒常功能的点在于存在问题。在繁荣期“交叉点”也起作用似乎是一个有些牵强的假设。生产方式的改进是萧条期的物质基础，通过每个景气周期，劳动者的生活水平（=中期繁荣期的那样）逐步提高这一点是正确的。这通常可以理解为，劳动者的生活时间增加→劳动日缩短，但与上一个周期相比，不能总是说劳动日一定缩短了。劳动日是由劳动强度的相关决定的，如果先前的繁荣期劳动强度并没有减轻而劳动日缩短，而这一期有相反的趋势，那么单一说劳动日缩短就是困难的。这也可以看出，生活水平的提高，不仅仅通过增加劳动者的生活时间，也在一定程度上通过扩大生活资料的范围可以实现。生活水平的提高并不总是增加主要负担家庭经济的成年男性工人的生活时间。 （5）关于劳动日、劳动强度以及劳动生产力之间的关系，请参阅第一卷第五篇第十五章“劳动力的价格与剩余价值的量化变动”。但是，马克思对这三者的组合有些粗暴。“在劳动生产力下降的同时劳动日延长的情况”可能是不必要的。 6 关于劳动日决定机制的解明 （1）积累论的途径 劳动日的界限是在资本的逻辑中决定的。为了解明这一决定机制，首先必须探明资本的积累过程。 马克思在第一卷第七篇第二十三章“资本主义积累的一般规律”中，辨析了资本积累的两种类型——资本的有机构成不变的情况，即所谓的横向扩张；以及伴随构成高度化的情况，即所谓的纵向扩张——同时指出，现代经济周期的基础在于相对过剩人口的特殊形成和吸收机制。“现代工业的典型生活过程，即中级繁荣、生产繁忙、恐慌、停滞的各阶段形成约十年一个周期的形态，在更小的波动中断的基础上，是基于不断的形成、或多或少的吸收以及再次形成的工业预备军或过剩人口上”（《资本论1》，马恩全集第二卷b，第824页）。 但在马克思那里，后者的类型被普遍化，好像工业预备军会逐渐形成，从而导致过剩人口的形成和吸纳系统缩小为所谓的贫困化法则，并没有在与经济各个阶段的关系中准确地被捕捉。马克思的人口规律论的缺陷可能表现在前者类型的积累可以通过恐慌外的方式人为地处理劳资上涨（=过度物化的劳动力导致资本支配的高估）和后者类型的积累的普遍化（=忽视固定资本的限制性）上。这不仅仅是“资本的流通过程”论的中介性被轻视，还有对劳动力商品特殊性理解不足的问题。劳动市场的动向确实受到资本积累进展的规制，但积累的规模是“独立变量”，这并不意味着资本可以自由调节其供需关系。资本永远不能像其他普通商品那样生产劳动力，只是在过剩人口的形成和吸纳的特殊机制中把它确保为商品而已。通过资本主义特有的人口规律的发展，才勉强能够实际解决劳动力商品化的矛盾。也是因为它具有这样的功能，人口规律这一独特系统才能成为周期性经济周期的基础过程。以下，从这一视角出发重新构建马克思的积累论。"},{"instruction":"请将“前者の型の蓄積——ここでは既存の資本構成を前提にして資本の量的拡大がはかられる。ゆえにそれは可変資本部分の増大を含むが、それは過剰人ロプールからの吸収によって賄われる。この蓄積の進展は、労働市場を売手市場化し、労働力の販売条件を労働者に有利にする。蓄積の欲望が労働力の供給を上回り始めると搾取の箍が徐々にゆるんでくる。労働者は上昇する賃金で消費財源を充実させるばかりか、小額の預金まで可能になる。いわば相対的に「安楽で自由な」地位を確保するのである。これにたいし資本家も当初は高利潤を獲得できるが、徐々に労賃の高騰から経営に圧迫を受けるようになる。そしてこの傾向は、過剰人ロのプールが払底するに及んで、決定的なものとなる。資本は賃金の高騰による利潤率の低下を利潤量の増大によって埋め合わそうと袋小路の蓄積にのめりこんでいくが、結局恐慌に行きつくしかない。総じて、前者の型の蓄積は、相対的過剩人口を吸収し、労働市場を緊迫させるのであって、ここでは雇用条件は労働者に有利に推移することになる。 後者の型の蓄積——構成高度化を伴う蓄積は労働力にたいする需要を相対的に減少させる。生産方法の技術的改良は、従来よりも多くの機械·原料を、従来よりも少ない労働量で稼動させることを可能にするからである。ゆえにこの蓄積がなされる時期は、労働者の一部が職場からはじき出され、相対的過剩人口が創出之れる。過剩人口の累積が死鑑の役目をはたすので、この期の雇用条件は労働者にとって不利となり、労働力の消費において「交差点」が機能することになる。労働市場の動向が供給超過の傾向をとる限りこれは必定であって、「労働の需要供給の法則」はここでも厳しく貫徹する。だがこの型の蓄積は不断になされうるものではない。固定設備の更新は、社会的には、從来の生産関係では資本活動の収縮·低迷を免れえなくなった主導的な産業資本が、固定資本の償却終了期に、競争に強制されて、集中的になされるのである。総じて、この型の蓄積は、過剩人口を排出し労働市場を緩和させるので、雇用条件はここでは資本家に有利に推移する。 かくて人口法則は、この二つの型の蓄積が恐慌を挟んで交互に入れ替わって進行するなかで展開されることになるが、それはまた資本蓄積過程が景気循環の基礎であることを意味している。人口法則は、現実的には、好況-恐慌-不況の一サイクルにおいて成立するものにほかならないのである。 では一体、かかる蓄積論的アプローチをもってした場合、労働日はいかに規定されるか。この問いには、次のようなマルクスのアブローチが有益なヒントを与えてくれよう。「だいたいにおいて労賃の一般的な運動は、ただ、産業循環の局面変転に対応する産業予備軍の膨張·収縮によって、規制されているだけである。だから、それは·····労働者階級が現役軍と予備軍とに分かれる割合の変動によって、過剩人口の相対的な大きさの増減によって、過剰人口が吸収されたり再び遊離されたりする程度によって、規定されているのである」（同、八三0頁）。つまり賃金は労働市場での「労働の需要供給の法則」により決定されるが、かかる需給動向を規制するものこそ「産業予備軍の膨張·収縮」にほかならない、というのである。 だがマルクスは、先に述ベたように、かかるアブローチの有する意義を必ずしも明確にできなかった。しかし、労働力の価値規定の特殊性-A-G-W·.·Aの資本運動からは相対的に独自なサイクルの全体において価値規定が実現されること、またそこで買戻される生活資料の範囲は賃金の高さに依存すること-を明確にしていれば、この視角の重要性は明らかであろう。すなわちそれは、労働力の価値規定は労働市場の動向に規制される「労賃の一般的な運動」を媒介に蓄積過程で基本的な完成をみるということを、換言すれば資本はその価値規定を人口法則という特有な機構により自力でなしうるということを、明示している。”翻译为中文","output":"第一种积累模式——在此，假设了现有的资本构成下资本数量的扩大。因此，它涵盖了可变资本部分的增加，这是通过吸收剩余人口池来实现的。这种积累的进展使劳动市场变为卖方市场，使劳动力的销售条件对劳动者有利。当资本的积累欲望开始超过劳动力供给时，剥削的环境逐渐放松。劳动者不仅能够用上升的工资充实消费品来源，甚至还可能拥有小额存款。可以说，相对地确保了一个“安逸而自由”的地位。对此，资本家最初也能获得高额利润，但逐渐受到工资上涨对经营的压力。随着剩余人口池的耗尽，这种趋势变得决定性。资本尝试通过增加利润量来弥补由工资上升引起的利润率下降，最终只能陷入死胡同并导致恐慌。总的来说，第一种积累模式是吸收相对过剩人口并使劳动市场紧张的，雇佣条件在这里变得对劳动者有利。 第二种积累模式——伴随高度化构成的积累相对减少了对劳动力的需求。技术改进的生产方式使使用比以往更多的机器和原材料、以更少的劳动量运行成为可能。因此，在这种积累进行的时期，部分劳动者会被排挤出职场，创造相对过剩人口。过剩人口的累积扮演了裁决者的角色，使得这一时期的雇佣条件对劳动者不利，“交叉点”在劳动力消费中发挥作用。只要劳动市场趋势供过于求，“劳动供需法则”在这里也会严格贯彻。但这种积累模式不可能持续进行。固定设施的更新，在社会上，是那些由于受到固定资本折旧结束期的竞争而不得不集中进行的主导性工业资本，以摆脱经营收缩和低迷。总的来说，这种积累模式是排除过剩人口并使劳动市场放松的，在这种情况下，雇佣条件变得对资本家有利。 因此，人口法则是在这两种积累模式中交替进行并穿插着恐慌的进程中展开的，这也意味着资本积累过程是经济周期的基础。人口法则实际上是在繁荣-恐慌-萧条的一个周期中成立的。 那么，按照这种积累理论的途径，劳动日是如何被规定的呢？马克思的方法为我们提供了有益的提示：“总体上劳资的一般性流动仅仅被工业周期的阶段转换所对应的产业预备军的扩张与收缩所调节。因此，它......被劳动者阶级分为现役军和预备军的比例变化、过剩人口的相对大小的增减、过剩人口被吸收或再次释放的程度所规定”（同，第830页）。也就是说，工资是由劳动市场中的“劳动供需法则”决定的，而调节这种供需趋势的正是“产业预备军的扩张与收缩”。 但如前所述，马克思并未能完全明确这种方法的意义。然而，如果清晰地指出劳动力价值规定的特殊性——从资本运动A-G-W·.·A中，价值规定在其相对独立的周期整体中实现，以及在那里回购的生活资料范围依赖于工资的高低——这种视角的重要性将是显而易见的。也就是说，劳动力价值规定通过累积过程中的“劳资一般性流动”这一媒介基本上实现，换句话说，资本可以通过人口法则这一特殊机制自力完成价值规定，就是明示了这一点。"},{"instruction":"请将“労働力の価值規定をめぐる経済外的規定の混濁は、それが結局価値法則の否定に帰着せざるをえぬ以上、是正されねばならない。これを蓄積論の次元に即していえば、その価值規定は窮乏化法則ではなく、人口法則＝労働市場論において分析されねばならない。前者の型の蓄積では、賃金の上昇と生活資料の範囲の拡大が、また後者の型の蓄積では、賃金の下落と生活資料の範囲の縮小がみられよう。二つの型の蓄積が交互に入れ替わる現実の蓄積過程全体をとおして、最終的に労働力商品の正常なる再生産が可能とされ、その価値も蓄積過程で内容的に規定されることになるのである。生産過程の次元で一定の大きさとされていた労働力の価値が、その生活資料の範囲（＝質と量）を具体化されるのであって、そこではじめて価値規定も科学的な基礎づけをえるのである。そしてそれはまた同時に「歷史的な道德的要素」自身、この資本蓄積の発展過程に客観的に規制されることを含んでいる。 この労働市場論的アプローチは、労働日の考察にも決定的に重要である。賃金にとどまらず雇用条件全体が、労働市場の需給動向により根本的に規制されると思われるからである。また実際、労働市場では、労働力の売買条件をめくって、労働者と資本家との主要利害が「権利対権利」として衝突するのであって、そこで締結される雇用契約には、賃金以外の労働条件が包まれることになる。 労働市場では資本家は、契約に際し、できるだけ自己に有利な雇用条件を取り結ぼうとする。たんに賃金問題にとどまらず、労働力の消費に関しても、そこから最大限の効用をひきだせる条件を期待するのである。これにたいして、労働者もできる限り有利な雇用にありつこうとする。高賃金、短い労働日、軽度な労働ヘの欲求がそれである。そして契約締結後、両者は生産過程におけるその履行を見守ることになる。両者の主張がいかなる程度で実現されるかは、労働市場での自由競争すなわち「労働の需要供給の法則」によるしかない。 ゆえにかかる視角からは、労働日は次のように規定されよう。前者の型の蓄積では、賃金の上昇とともに労働日の短縮がみられる。労働者の側への労働力の使用条件の好転は、生産力水準にあまり変化がないので、労働の強度よりむしろ労働日においてよく表現されるのである。これにたいし、後者の型の蓄積では、逆転して、賃金の下落とともに労働日は延長化される傾向を帯びる。ただしここでは雇用条件の悪化は労働の強化となってョリ強く反映される。「交差点」が機能するので、労働日はそう極端には延長されないのである。いわば過剰人口の吸収期には労働日の短縮が、また排出期にはその延長が一般的であると結論できる。ただ、ここでは機械制工場の社会的確立から労働力の単純化·平均化が、またそれを基礎に労働市場の均質的な統一性が前提にされていることを銘記しておかねばならない。 しかし、いまだ労働力の価値規定と使用価値規定との異質性という問題が残っていよう。価值規定にたいし、その使用価值規定は、労働市場での雇用契約に規制されるとはいえ、本質的には生産過程での資本家の労働力消費に関わる問題である。労働日は生産過程で具体的な定在をみるのであって、その大きさは雇用契約で予め規定されているとはいえ、そとで確定されうるものではない。それは、労働者が資本の指揮権の下に従属して実際労働するまでは具体的に確定されがたいのである。生産過程では、何を、いかなる仕方で、どれだけ生産するかの決定は資本家の権限に属するのであって、そこではしぼしば労働市場での契約的な合意をこえる事態が発生することになる。いわゆる「労働契約の不確定性」が云々される理由もここにある。労働環境、労務管理システム（＝職制）、作業方式などの在り方しだいで、生産過程の労働も具体的に左右されることになる。また資本が、強権的な形で、就業規制を改悪したり、雇用契約を無視して、貪婪な労働力消費を企てるのも事実である。（労働日に法的規制がもたらされた理由のひとつもここにある）。”翻译为中文","output":"围绕劳动力价值规定的经济外部决定的混乱，终究不得不归结于否定价值规律，因此必须被纠正。如果从积累理论的维度来说，这种价值规定不应该通过贫困化规律，而应该在人口规律=劳动市场理论中进行分析。在第一种积累模式中，可以看到工资上升和生活资料范围的扩大，而在第二种积累模式中，则看到工资下降和生活资料范围的缩小。通过两种积累模式交替更换的实际积累过程，最终使劳动力商品的正常再生产成为可能，并且其价值也在积累过程中得到内容上的确定。在生产过程的维度中被定为一定大小的劳动力价值，通过具体化其生活资料的范围（=质和量）来实现，从而首次获得科学的基础。同时，这也包括了“历史的道德元素”本身，在资本积累的发展过程中被客观规制。 这种劳动市场理论的方法对于劳动日的考虑也具有决定性的重要性。因为可以认为，工资以及整体的雇佣条件都基本上受到劳动市场供需趋势的根本性调节。实际上，在劳动市场中，劳动力的买卖条件会触及劳动者与资本家的主要利益的“权利对权利”的冲突，从而在达成的雇佣合同中包括了工资以外的劳动条件。 在劳动市场上，资本家在签订合同时会尽可能为自己争取有利的雇佣条件。不仅仅是工资问题，就劳动力消费而言，也期望能从中获得最大的效益。相对地，劳动者也会尽力获得尽可能有利的雇佣。高工资、短工作日、轻劳动的渴望就是如此。签约后，双方将监督生产过程中的履行情况。双方主张在何种程度上实现，只能通过劳动市场上的自由竞争，即“劳动供需法则”来决定。 因此，从这个角度来看，劳动日将被如下定义：在第一种积累模式下，随着工资的上升，可以看到劳动日的缩短。劳动力使用条件向劳动者一方面的转变，在生产力水平变化不大的情况下，更多地在劳动日而不是劳动强度上表现出来。相对地，第二种积累模式下，随着工资的下降，劳动日呈延长化的趋势。但在这里，雇佣条件的恶化体现为劳动强化的加剧。“交叉点”的功能作用下，劳动日不会极端延长。可以得出结论，过剩人口的吸收期常见劳动日的缩短，而排出期则是其延长。但是，这里需要记住，机械化工厂的社会确立以及劳动力的简单化、均化，以及基于此的劳动市场的均质统一性被假定的事实。 然而，劳动力价值规定与使用价值规定的异质性问题仍然存在。针对价值规定，其使用价值规定虽然受到劳动市场上的雇佣合同的调节，但本质上是关于资本家在生产过程中劳动力消费的问题。劳动日在生产过程中具体定位，尽管其大小是在雇佣合同中预先规定的，但在劳动者实际屈从于资本的指挥权下从事实际工作之前，它难以被具体确定。在生产过程中，决定生产什么、以何种方式、以及生产多少的决定权属于资本家，那里经常会出现超出劳动市场合同约定的情况。所谓的“劳动合同的不确定性”也因此被提出。劳动环境、劳务管理系统（=职级）、作业方式等的设定，也将具体影响生产过程中的劳动。此外，资本以强权方式恶化就业规制或无视雇佣合同，企图贪婪地消费劳动力也是事实（这也是劳动日法律规制的原因之一）。"},{"instruction":"请将“だが、このことから労働日は無規定であるとはいえない。資本主義では生産過程における階級関係も商品関係を通さなければ成立しない。ゆえに労働日も労働契約により間接的に規制されざるをえない。資本家と労働者は労働市場で「権利対権利」として衝突するが、そこで締結される雇用契約には、労働日が、雇用条件の一部をなすものとして、すなわち賃金と並び両者の主要利害をなすものとして包含されざるをえない。したがって、労働者が生産過程で不満や反抗をおぼえても、それによる労資の紛争は、原理的には、労働市場で再契約がなされる際の労資双方の側からする雇用条件ヘの新たな要求という形でいわば商品経済的に処理される以外にない。もちろん両者はそれぞれ雇用を選択する自由を有しているのであって、両者の利害が折り合いのつけられない場合には労働契約の破棄も考えられる。だがこのことは、資本家は自己に有利な雇用条件をのみうる労働者を求めて、また労働者はより良い条件を提示している資本家を求めて、各々労働市場を自由に移動することを意味するにすぎない。 それゆえ、労働力の使用価値は、雇用関係を規制する労働市場の需給関係により、間接的にではあるが経済的に決定されるのである。 （2）景気循環論的＝競争論的アプローチ 資本蓄積は決してそれ自身で成立しているのではない。それは、現実的には、景気循環過程として現れる。資本蓄積過程は、構成不変型の蓄積と構成高度化型の蓄積が交互に入替わって進行する過程であったが、競争場裡ではそれは景気循環の二局面という現実的形態をとる。 ここでは、労働市場における労資の対立も、そのままの形では現れない。それは、資本家間の競争および労働者間の競争という外的な形態を介して現れる。いわば労資関係はかかる現象のうちに隠蔽されてしまうのである。 自己に有利な労働条件、特に長時間労働を獲得したいという資本家の要求は、ここでは最大限利潤の追求という具体的な意識形態をとって現れる。 （a）他の資本が新しい機械設備を採用すると旧来の設備の価値が低下してしまうので、機械設備の物質的、道德的摩損を回避すべく、資本家は労働日を延長し、短期間での摩滅を図ることになる。 （b）資本の回転期間の短縮により利潤率を上昇できるので、資本家は労働日の延長による労働期間の短縮をはかる。 （c）費用価格の引下げの一手段として、労働日が延長される。 このように労働日の延長は、現実的には、資本家間の競争にうちかとうとする個別資本家の具体的活動において成立する。だが、資本家のそのようなビヘイビアは、この次元では、より有利な雇用条件を求めて労働市場を移動する労働者の運動によって制約されざるをえない。 これにたいし、労働者の短時間労働への希求は、他の労働者より良好な地位を占めんとする労働者間の競争を媒介にして実現される。そしてそれは、より自己に有利な生産条件を求める資本家のビヘイビアにより根本的に制約されるのである。 以下、景気循環過程に即して労働日の変動をトレースするが、まずかかるアプローチが可能である根拠を提示しておく。というのは、労働日は元来労働力の使用価值規定としては労働の強度と不可分離なものとしてあるが、どうしてかかる一体的な関連から労働日規定のみを抽象しうるかを説明しておく必要があるからである。結論的には不況期に更新され機械設備が、景気の一サイクルを通しての労働強度の一定性という前提を客観的に保障すること、これこそ労働日の抽象を根拠づけるものである。もちろん強度が全く変化しないということはないが、労働の生産力水準という物質的＝技術的(2)な基礎に制約される以上、一サイクル内ではその幅は極めて狭いものといわねばならない。 好況期の労働日-この局面では蓄積は順調に発展する。資本は商品販売量の増加による利潤量の增大に全力をあげる。商品価格が全般的に上向きに推移するからである。生産量の増加は労働日の延長や労働の強化では追いつかず、貸付資本の利用により経営が拡大され新たに労働者が雇用されることになる。それは不変資本部分の増大をも伴うが、大規模な固定設備の改良はみられないので、資本構成はほぼ不変のままである。”翻译为中文","output":"但是，这并不意味着劳动日没有规定。在资本主义中，生产过程中的阶级关系也不能不通过商品关系来建立。因此，劳动日也不得不间接地受到劳动合同的规制。资本家和劳动者在劳动市场上作为“权利对权利”冲突，因此签订的雇佣合同必须包含劳动日，作为雇佣条件的一部分，即作为双方主要利害的一部分，与工资并列。因此，即使劳动者在生产过程中感到不满或反抗，基于劳动力市场在重新签约时劳资双方提出的新的雇佣条件要求的形式下，劳资冲突在原则上除了商品经济学上处理之外别无选择。当然，双方都有选择雇佣的自由，如果双方利益无法协调，也可以考虑解除劳动合同。但这只意味着资本家会寻求对自己有利的雇佣条件的劳动者，而劳动者会寻找提供更好条件的资本家，各自在劳动市场上自由移动。 因此，劳动力的使用价值是通过劳动市场上调节雇佣关系的供需关系间接但经济上决定的。 （2）景气循环论=竞争论方法 资本积累绝不是自成体系的。实际上，它以景气循环过程的形式出现。资本积累过程是构成不变型积累和构成高度化型积累交替进行的过程，在竞争场中以景气循环的两个实际形态表现。 在这里，劳资之间的对立并不以原样形式出现。它通过资本家之间的竞争以及劳动者之间的竞争这种外在形式来表现。可以说，劳资关系在这种现象中被掩盖了。 资本家渴望获得对自己有利的劳动条件，特别是长时间劳动的需求，在这里以追求最大利润的具体意识形态出现。 （a）当其他资本采用新的机械设备时，旧设备的价值会下降，所以资本家通过延长劳动日，并在短时间内加速摩耗，以避免机械设备的物质和道德磨损。 （b）通过缩短资本周转期来提高利润率，所以资本家通过延长劳动日来缩短劳动期。 （c）作为降低费用价格的一种手段，劳动日得到延长。 这样，劳动日的延长实际上是通过个别资本家在竞争中努力生存的具体活动来实现的。但是，资本家的这种行为在这个维度上不可避免地受到寻求更有利雇佣条件的劳动者在劳动市场上移动的行为的制约。 相对地，劳动者对短工时的追求是通过劳动者之间争取更好地位的竞争来实现的。并且，根本上受到寻求更有利生产条件的资本家行为的制约。 在接下来的分析中，我们将追踪景气循环过程中劳动日的变化，但首先提出这种方法是可能的依据。因为劳动日本来作为劳动力的使用价值规定与劳动强度不可分离，需要解释为何能从这种整体关系中单独抽象出劳动日规定。最终，不景气期更新的机械设备，通过整个景气周期内的劳动强度的一定性客观保证了这一点，这正是劳动日抽象的基础。当然，强度不会完全不变，但受到一个周期内劳动生产力水平这一物质=技术基础的制约，其幅度非常有限。 繁荣期的劳动日-在这一阶段，积累顺利发展。资本全力以赴地增加商品销售量以增加利润量，因为商品价格普遍上涨。产量增加无法通过延长劳动日或加强劳动来赶上，通过使用借贷资本扩大经营并雇佣新的劳动者。这虽然伴随着不变资本部分的增加，但由于没有大规模的固定设施改进，资本构成几乎保持不变。"},{"instruction":"请将“この間、既存の過剰人ロプールを吸収しつ雇用が拡大していくので、労働市場は緊迫し、雇用条件は徐々に労働者に有利になっていく。また高利潤＝高蓄積の資本の方も労働者の労働条件改善の要求をのみうる経済的余裕を有することになる。 この状況にあっては、労働者間の競争がポジティプに作用する。ある一個別企業ないし一業種で、労働者の側が、従来の平均的な雇用条件をぬきんでる有利な労働条件を確保すると、それは労働市場における労働者の移動を惹起し、結局その労働条件の社会的一般化を帰結させることになる。より良き地位の獲得が、かかる移動の動機となっていることはいうまでもない。 こうして労働市場が流動化するが、この過程は過剰人口プールの漸次的減少と相俟って、労働市場を売手市場へと転化させる。そしてかかる市場動向を背景にして、賃上げとともに、労働日の短縮が実現されるのである。そしてこの短縮化傾向は過剰人ロプールの払底を契機に、決定的なものとなる。 最好況期の労働日——好況期の蓄積は、ある段階で、労働力の枯渴に逢着せざるをえない。だが賃金の高騰による利潤率の低下も、蓄積を中断させるものではない。価格のインフレ傾向がかかる根本的事態を隠蔽し、利潤量の增大蓄積の拡大の過程が進展する。率の低下を量でカパーしようとする動きが、蓄積を加速化するからである。資本が資本として過剰になっていくこの局面で、逆說的にも利潤が利潤を生み、資本が資本を生むという景気過熱的な現象が顕現することになる。だが、賃金の高騰はかかる蓄積の進行をも許さなくなり、より大なる資本がより小なる利潤しか生まないという事態がもたらされる。いわゆる資本の絕対的な過剰であって、これは信用の崩壊を伴う恐慌となって現れる。 この期には、労働市場での労働者の地位は決定的に有利なものとなり、労働条件の大幅な改善が実現される。通常の賃金でも、十分に生活水準を向上させかつ預金を可能にさせる程の経済的余裕が生(3)ずる。ゆえに残業や長時間労働が当然忌避されるようになる。そしてこのことがますます企業に人手不足を喚起し、賃金高騰や労働日の短縮に拍車をかけるのである。すなわち、この期に労働日の短縮は、その極限にまで押し進められ、ほぼその下限に達することになる。 恐慌期の労働日-恐慌は利潤率の急落と利子率の高騰、両者の衝突を契機に現実化する。ことでは、資本の絶対的過剰により、資本蓄積それ自身が無意味になる。 急激な価格下落が生ずるこの期には、資本相互の競争は、より多くの利潤をめぐるそれというよりも、むしろ自己負担の回避とその他人資本への転稼のための競争となる。いわば負担の縮減が個々の資本の最大関心事になるのである。それゆえここでは、在庫商品の投売り、操業短縮、首切りなどがなされるのであって、この競争に敗れた資本は操業停止や倒産の憂き目にあうことになる。 資本の価值破壊と活動収縮が進行するなかで、資本家はこの不測の事態に十分に対応できず、解雇·操短といった小手先の消極的対応策で急場をしのごうとする。これにたいし、労働者は既得の地位を必死に守ろうとするが、結局雇用条件の悪化は避けられない。だが、産業活動自身が収縮するので、それは主に賃金面に反映され、労働日はそう極端には延長されないのである。 不況前期の労働日-との期の価格はまだ全般的に低滞している。それは費用価格の低下による利潤率回復の一契機になるが、自己の製品価格も低落しているので、利潤率はいまだ根本的回復には至りえない。個別企業は、激しい競争戦にたえぬくために、精々経費節減とくに生産費のコストダウンと販路の確保につとめ、信用の利用を制限して経営の引締めを継続する。 この期は失業者が漸次增加し、労働市場の緩和が進行する。好況期の場合とは反対に、ある個別企業が従来より一層自己に有利な労働条件で雇用をなした場合には、他の資本競争上こぞってかかる雇用を追求することになる。労働者側の不満·抵抗にたいして、資本家は不満分子や反抗分子の解雇と失業層からの補給という形で対処できるのである。かくて労働市場は買手市場化する。低賃金状態で、労働力の一層貪婪で無駄のない消費がなされることになる。”翻译为中文","output":"在此期间，由于吸收了已有的过剩人口，雇佣不断扩大，劳动市场变得紧张，雇佣条件逐渐对劳动者变得有利。同时，高利润=高积累的资本方面也具备了经济余裕，以接受劳动者对劳动条件改善的要求。 在这种情况下，劳动者间的竞争起到了积极作用。在某个特定企业或行业里，如果劳动者方面获得了优于传统平均雇佣条件的有利劳动条件，这将引发劳动市场上劳动者的流动，并最终导致那些劳动条件的社会普及。争取更好地位成为此类流动的动机是不言而喻的。 这样，劳动市场变得流动化，这一过程与过剩人口池的逐步减少相结合，将劳动市场转变为卖方市场。在这种市场动向的背景下，随着工资的上涨，劳动日的缩短得以实现。这种缩短趋势在过剩人口枯竭时变得决定性。 最佳状况期的劳动日——繁荣期的积累在某个阶段必然遭遇劳动力的枯竭。但是，由于工资上涨导致的利润率下降并不会中断积累。价格的通货膨胀趋势掩盖了这一根本状况，增加利润量的积累扩张过程得以进展。试图通过增加数量来弥补利润率下降的做法加速了积累。在这个阶段，资本作为资本过剩地增加，反倒是利润生产利润，资本生产资本的景气过热现象出现。但是，工资的上涨不再允许这种积累进程继续，导致更大的资本只能产生更少的利润，这是所谓的资本的绝对过剩，会以信用崩溃伴随的恐慌形式出现。 在这一阶段，劳动市场上劳动者的地位变得极为有利，得以实现劳动条件的大幅改善。即使是普通工资，也足以提高生活水平并使存款成为可能。因此，加班和长时间劳动自然会被回避。这进一步导致企业面临人手不足，加剧了工资上涨和劳动日缩短的趋势。也就是说，在这一阶段，劳动日的缩短被推进到极限，几乎达到了其下限。 恐慌期的劳动日 - 恐慌是由于利润率急剧下降和利息率上升，这两者冲突触发的。在这个阶段，由于资本的绝对过剩，资本积累本身变得毫无意义。 在这一期间出现急剧的价格下跌，资本之间的竞争不再是为了更多利润的争夺，而更多是为了避免自身负担和转嫁给其他资本的竞争。可以说，减少负担成为各个资本的最大关注点。因此，在这里，会进行库存商品的抛售、缩短操作时间、裁员等，败于这场竞争的资本将面临停业或破产的命运。 在资本价值破坏和活动收缩的过程中，资本家无法充分应对这种不测情况，试图通过解雇、缩短操作时间等权宜之计应急。相对地，劳动者会拼命保护已获得的地位，但最终难以避免雇佣条件的恶化。但是，由于产业活动本身收缩，这主要反映在工资方面，劳动日不会极端延长。 不景气前期的劳动日 - 在这个阶段，价格普遍仍然停滞低迷。这可能成为利润率恢复的一个契机，但由于自身产品价格也下降，利润率尚未根本恢复。个别企业为了在激烈的竞争中生存，尽量努力降低成本，特别是降低生产费用和确保销售渠道，限制信用使用并持续紧缩经营。 这一时期失业者逐渐增加，劳动市场放松。与繁荣期相反，如果某个特定企业采用了比以往更有利的劳动条件进行雇佣，其他资本为了竞争会纷纷追求这种雇佣。面对劳动者的不满和抵抗，资本家可以通过解雇不满或反抗的员工并从失业层中补充来应对。于是劳动市场变为买方市场。在低工资状况下，劳动力会被更加贪婪且无浪费地消费。"},{"instruction":"请将“労働者の側の要求は、その力を失ってくる。過剰人口プールが死錘の作用を果すからであるが、そればかりではなく、資本家の側にもその要求に応じうる経済的余力がもはやなくなっている。雇用量の縮小は、雇用機会をえるためのまた職場を確保し続けるための、労働者間の競争を強める。そしてこれが先の資本家のビヘイビアと一緒になって、労働条件の一層の劣悪化を招くのである。 かくて強搾取が展開されるが、労働の強化には、それが未だ旧来の固定設備に基いている点で生産カ＝技術的な制限が伴うので、それはもっばら労働日の延長において実現されることになる。労働力の使用が、明瞭に「交差点」にひきつけられているからであって、この期に労働日はほぼその上限に達する。 る。 不況後期の労働日——この期には、固定資本の償却終了期をむかえた主導産業の資本に、固定設備の更新を伴う費用価格の画期的低下がみられる。合理化を図，た資本は、当然超過利潤を獲得するが、その一部の資本による独占は一過的なものにすぎない。他の資本も、競争関係により、新たな生産方法の採用を強制されるからである。こうして構成の高度化を伴う資本蓄積がこの期を領導することになるが、生産性の向上を伴う生産の再開·拡張は、多くの資本に利潤率の根本的回復ヘの契機を与え、景気は徐々に回復過程を辿ることになる。利子率の低下と貸付資本の利用が、これを促進する。 産業の合理化·再編成の成立過程は、過剩人ロプールがピークに達する過程でもある。ゆえにそこでは労働市場は全き買手市場となる。雇用をめぐる労働者間の競争決定的な段階に入り、雇用条件は悪化の一途を辿る。だから、資本家は作業様式の改変に伴い、労務管理の強化·就業規則の改悪を強行し、経営の立直しをはかれるのである。いわば資本家は積極的な合理化攻勢にでて、好況期に労働者に侵食された失地を奪回し、労働者の慣行化した既得権を切りくずすのである。かかる攻勢にたいし、労働者は抵抗するが、大量失業群の存在がその反発を制約する。それゆえ依然として労働力の使用は、「交差点」にひきつけられたままである。だが生産方法の改良が実現されるため、ことでは新たな技術的基礎にもとづいた労働の強化が図られる。より高度な機械の運転、作業ノルマの拡大などは「交差点」の機能により労働日を、不況前期に比較して、やや短縮することになる。マルクスのいうように、労働強度の系統的引上げは、「労働時間の再度の減少が避け」られなくなる「一つの転回点」を形成するからである。そして、この短縮化傾向は、景気回復期における労働市場の緊迫化により、漸次進展していくことになるのである。 労働日は、以上みてきたように、景気の循環に即して変動するのであって、標準労働日は、理論的には、この景気循環過程全体をとおして決定されることになる。そしてその長さは、生活水準の場合と同じく、ほぼ中位の活況期の労働日に相当するといえよう。 （1）現実的には産業資本は、しばしば“Long Hours”が社会的にもたらす結果に無頓着なまま、強搾取を展開する。産業革命期に強力となった綿業資本の不熟練労働部分にたいする搾取がそれである。機械制工場の確立をもってするこの強搾取は、一九世紀初頭には社会的地位の低下にそう遇した熟練労働者層の激しい抵抗——いわゆるラダイツ運動——を呼び起こし、それ以後、賃金闘争や労働日短縮運動にみられる労働運動の展開を契機づけることにもなった。 そしてこれらが実際上、労働日の延長の限界を資本家に自覚させる具体的な諸契機であったことは否定できない。だがなんといっても資本家に強搾取＝長時間労働の限界を事実として告知していたものは、労働市場の動向と周期的恐慌であって、この支配的な事実に依拠して、労働日延長の限界を、いわゆる労働力商品化の矛盾から原理的に規定しえたのである。 （2）労働の強度も、労働日と同樣、基本的には蓄積過程によって決定されるといってよいが、労働日を一定として景気循環論的アプローチを試みることが恣意性を免れえない以上、それは労働日規定をとぉして間接的に規定されるものと考えられよう。この点では労働力の使用価値規定は、その価值規定と異なり、復雜な構造-積極的規定としての労働日、消極的規定としての労働の強度、という二重性-を有しているのである。”翻译为中文","output":"劳动者方面的要求开始失去力量。这是因为过剩人口池发挥了其作用，但不仅如此，资本家方面也不再有经济余力来响应这些要求。雇佣量的缩小加剧了劳动者之间为了获得就业机会和保持工作岗位的竞争。这种现象与前述资本家的行为结合在一起，导致劳动条件进一步恶化。 于是强剥削得以展开，但由于强化的劳动仍然基于旧有的固定设备，因此伴随着生产=技术性的限制，这主要通过劳动日的延长实现。因为劳动力的使用明确地被吸引到了“交叉点”，在这个时期，劳动日几乎达到其上限。 不景气后期的劳动日——在这一时期，进入固定资本折旧结束期的主导产业的资本见证了固定设备更新带来的成本价格的革命性下降。实施合理化的资本自然获得超额利润，但其中一部分资本的垄断只是暂时性的。因为其他资本也被竞争关系迫使采用新的生产方法。于是，伴随构成高度化的资本积累在这一时期成为领导者，生产的恢复和扩张带来的生产力提升，为许多资本提供了根本性利润率恢复的契机，景气逐渐进入回复过程。利息率的下降和借贷资本的使用促进了这一进程。 产业合理化和重组的形成过程也是过剩人口池达到顶峰的过程。因此，劳动市场变成了完全的买方市场。劳动者之间围绕就业的竞争进入了决定性阶段，雇佣条件呈恶化趋势。因此，资本家可以通过改变工作模式、加强劳务管理、恶化就业规则来实现经营的扭转。可以说，资本家发起了积极的合理化进攻，夺回了繁荣期被劳动者侵占的失地，削减了劳动者惯例化的既得权益。面对这种进攻，劳动者进行抵抗，但大量失业者的存在限制了其反弹。因此，劳动力的使用仍然被吸引到“交叉点”。但由于实现了生产方法的改进，这一时期基于新的技术基础实施了劳动强化。更高级别的机器操作、作业定额的扩大等，由于“交叉点”的作用，劳动日与不景气前期相比有所缩短。正如马克思所说，劳动强度的系统性提高形成了“避免不了的重新减少劳动时间的一个转折点”。而这种缩短趋势将在景气回复期劳动市场紧张的背景下逐步进展。 劳动日，如上所述，随着景气循环而变化，理论上，标准工作日是通过整个景气循环过程来确定的。其长度大致相当于中等繁荣期的劳动日。 （1）事实上，产业资本常常在对社会带来的结果漠不关心的情况下展开强剥削。工业革命期间繁荣的棉纺资本对低技能劳动部分的剥削就是一个例子。这种强剥削随着机械化工厂的建立而实施，在19世纪初引发了地位低下的熟练劳动者层的激烈抵抗——所谓的拉达伊特运动——随后触发了以工资斗争和劳动日缩短运动为特征的劳动运动的展开。 这些实际上是资本家意识到劳动日延长限制的具体契机，但无论如何通过劳动市场的动向和周期性恐慌，资本家被事实告知了强剥削=长时间劳动的限制，依据这一支配性事实，能够从所谓的劳动力商品化的矛盾中原理性地规定了劳动日延长的限制。 （2）劳动强度也基本上由积累过程决定，就像劳动日一样，但由于试图采取景气循环论方法将劳动日视为固定的会带来任意性，因此可以认为劳动强度是通过劳动日规定间接决定的。在这一点上，劳动力的使用价值规定具有与其价值规定不同的复杂结构——作为积极规定的劳动日、作为消极规定的劳动强度的双重性。"},{"instruction":"请将“（3）常識的には、賃金が上昇しているので、この期には労働者は進んで長時間労働や残業を引き受け、その結果労働日が延長されるかのように考えられ易いが、それは低賃金-長時間労働が慣行化している特殊日本資本主義の雇用関係に制約された発想にすぎないであろう。 （4）この点に関し、ほぼ同一の視点から出発しつつ、正反対の結論に行きついた、徳永重良と降旗節雄の見解を、簡単に検討しておこう。 徳永教授の見解は以下の通りである。労働日の変動は「短期的には、景気循環の各段階に応じて増減する労働力にたいする需要量によって、長期的には、かかる循環過程を通して変化する生産方法、したがって労働強度、さらに賃金水準などによって、大きく左右されることになる。」（『労働問題と社会政策論』有斐閣、一九七0年、五六頁）。そして具体的には、労働日は、長期的趨勢としては短縮される傾向にあり、短期的には概して好況期に延長され、最好況期に最も延長されつつ反転し、その後の恐慌·不況局面で短縮される傾向にあることが実証される、と結論されるのである。 しかし教授の見解には、労働日の変動が、原理的にとかれているのか否かが不明瞭であるという点をおいても、なお難点があるように思われる。アメリカ資本主義の、しかも一八六0～九八年、一九一九～三九年といった資料が利用されているが、それは理論を導く素材たりえないのではないか。いかに資料的な制約があるとはいえ、特殊なアメリカ資本主義の、それも独占段階の資料から理論を組み立てるのは、根本的に無理があるといわねばならない。またこれに関連して、教授の理論的な労働日規定も誤まっていよう。労働市場論的アプローチを前提にすれば、教授の規定とは反対に、好況期＝労働者の雇用条件の好転＝労働日短縮、不況期＝労働者の雇用条件の劣悪化＝労働日延長というシェーマが、一般的に成立しよう。そしてこれは、『資本論』-もちろんそれには教授の主張を裏づけるような叙述も含まれてはいるがーが工場監督官報告をかりて指摘している事実ともほぼ合致するのである。 それゆえ、労働日の景気循環論的規定で、降旗教授が徳永教授と正反対の結論をだしたことは評価されらる。教授は、標準労働日は、生活水準と同様、景気循環を通して決定されるとし、不況段階では雇用条件が悪化し労働日延長されるが、景気が回復し蓄積が順調に進行していくと雇用条件は改善され労働日短縮される、と結論される（前揭「宇野理論と政治学」を参照）。教授の見解は基本的に正しいが、しかしまだその細部に問題を残していよう。具体的には、不況前期＝労働日短縮、不況後期＝労働日延長という主張が、『資本論』の歴史的叙述によってのみとかれていることである。それは、教授における蓄積論的アプロ-チと景気循環論的アプローチの未分化および「交差点」規定の軽視に関連していよう。我々は、理論的にはすでに本文で示したように、教授と異なり、恐慌期＝労働日短縮、不況前期＝労働日延長、不況後期＝労働日短縮と結論せざるをえない。 7 結語 労働日の長さは、生産過程では、一定の大きさとして与えられたが、標準労働日が景気循環過程をとおして具体的に決定されることが論証されることによって、その正当性が科学的に裏づけられることになる。いわば労働日の長さは、まったき意味において、純経済的に規定されうるのである。そしてこのことは、労働日規定からのマハト·テオリーの排除が論理的に必然であることを示している。学史的に回顧すれば、マルクスの経済学批判の道程は、ある意味では、資本による雇用条件の純経済的規定＜向けての、苦闘の歴史であった。『経済学·哲学草稿』でスミス価値論に階級闘争の論理をもつて反撥したマルクスは、『哲学の貧困』で漸くリカード価値論の「科学」性を容認し、古典派経済学の内在的批判ヘと向かうことになる。そして『経済学批判要綱』で画期的な労働力商品の概念把握に行きつき、以後『資本論』体系に至るまで、その徹底化を図るのである。こうして経済学批判の深化過程は、階級闘争の論理から商品経済の論理（＝資本の論理）ヘの転換において実現されるが、それは、マルクスが資本主義の自律的運動法則の解明を経済学批判の究極目標としていた以上、必然的なことであった。”翻译为中文","output":"（3）常识上认为，由于工资上升，这一时期劳动者会愿意接受长时间工作和加班，从而导致劳动日延长，但这可能只是受限于特殊的日本资本主义雇佣关系中习以为常的低工资-长时间劳动的思维方式而已。 （4）关于这一点，尽管出发点几乎相同，但德永重良和降旗节雄得出了完全相反的结论，我们简单审视一下他们的观点。 德永教授的观点如下：劳动日的变动“短期内随着景气循环的各个阶段对劳动力需求量的增减变化，长期内则随着这些循环过程中生产方式的变化，因而也随着劳动强度、进一步是工资水平的变化而大受影响。”（《劳动问题与社会政策论》，有斐阁，1970年，56页）。具体而言，劳动日在长期趋势上呈现缩短，短期内通常在繁荣期延长，在最佳阶段延长至最大但开始转折，随后在恐慌和不景气阶段趋于缩短的趋势，这是可以证实的。 然而，教授的观点即使不论其对劳动日变动是否进行了原理性分析的模糊性，似乎还存在问题。他使用的是美国资本主义，特别是1860-1898年，1919-1939年的资料，这似乎不足以作为理论推导的素材。尽管有资料的限制，但基于特殊的美国资本主义，尤其是垄断阶段的资料来构建理论，根本上是不可行的。此外，与此相关的，教授对劳动日的理论定义也可能是错误的。如果前提是劳动市场理论的方法，与教授的定义相反，繁荣期=劳动者的雇佣条件改善=劳动日缩短，不景气期=劳动者的雇佣条件恶化=劳动日延长的模式应当普遍成立。这与《资本论》中——当然，它也包含支持教授观点的叙述——利用工厂监察官报告指出的事实大体一致。 因此，关于劳动日的景气循环论定义，降旗教授得出了与德永教授正相反的结论，这是值得肯定的。教授认为，标准劳动日与生活水平一样，是通过景气循环来决定的，不景气阶段雇佣条件恶化并导致劳动日延长，但随着经济恢复和积累顺利进行，雇佣条件将改善，劳动日缩短（参见“宇野理论与政治学”）。教授的观点基本上是正确的，但仍然留有细节上的问题。具体而言，不景气前期=劳动日缩短，不景气后期=劳动日延长的主张，仅仅是基于《资本论》的历史叙述。这与教授未能区分积累论方法和景气循环论方法以及忽视“交叉点”规定相关。我们理论上，如文中已经展示的，与教授不同地得出结论，恐慌期=劳动日缩短，不景气前期=劳动日延长，不景气后期=劳动日缩短。 结论 劳动日的长度虽然在生产过程中被视为一定的大小，但通过论证标准劳动日是如何通过景气循环过程具体决定的，其合理性得到科学证实。换句话说，劳动日的长度完全可以纯经济地规定。这表明，从劳动日规定中排除伪理论是逻辑上必然的。从学术史角度回顾，马克思的经济学批判道路，在某种意义上是围绕着资本对雇佣条件的纯经济规定进行的艰难历程。马克思在《经济学哲学手稿》中对斯密价值论提出阶级斗争逻辑的反击，最终在《哲学的贫困》中承认李嘉图价值论的“科学性”，面向古典经济学的内在批判。然后，在《政治经济学批判》中达到了劳动力商品概念理解的划时代，在此之后直至《资本论》体系的构建，进行了彻底化。因此，经济学批判的深化过程是通过从阶级斗争逻辑到商品经济逻辑（=资本逻辑）的转变实现的，这是因为马克思将揭示资本主义自主运动规律作为经济学批判的终极目标，是不可避免的。"},{"instruction":"Repeat

Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure.

Clyde 1 is ending their FM transmission today. User2: Really? That’s a huge change! Do you know why they’re making the switch? User1: It seems like they’re moving completely digital. It’s the end of an era for traditional radio. User3: I can’t believe it! Clyde 1 has been such a staple for so many of us. It’s sad to see FM go. User4: I wonder what the final song will be. Any guesses? User5: I heard they’re playing “Whistle for the Choir” as the last song on both FM and Digital. It’s a fitting choice. User2: That’s a great song to end on. I’m sure it will bring back a lot of memories for listeners. User1: I just tuned in, and they’re playing all the hits before they switch over. They just played “Shape of You” and “Power.” User3: It’s like a trip down memory lane. Those songs were huge when they were first released. User4: I hope they play some old clips from their shows too. It would be a nice way to reminisce about the good times. User5: I’m sure they’ll play all the classics. Maybe we’ll hear some snippets from the old breakfast shows or roadshows. User1: They just played “Strip That Down” and “Can’t Stop the Feeling.” It’s like a blast from the past! User2: I can’t wait to hear the farewell lullaby. It’s going to be such a heartfelt moment. User3: The lullaby always gets me emotional. It’s a beautiful way to say goodbye to FM.

Я не умею правильно распределять время на свои дела, на какие-то бытовые вещи. К тому же я скорее всего растягиваю время на какие-то дела, потому хочу хочу пожить для подольше от сна до сна и побольше всего успеть одновременно, но в итоге все получается так себе. Я понимаю, что это психологическая проблема. Помоги пожалуйста мне ее решить. Может быть дашь какие-нибудь советы или рекомендации","output":"Конечно, я постараюсь помочь. Важно помнить, что управление временем - это навык, который требует практики и терпения, чтобы его освоить. Ваше желание улучшить этот аспект уже является большим шагом вперед. Давайте посмотрим на несколько практических советов, которые могут помочь вам лучше организовать свое время и сделать ваш день более продуктивным. # 1. Поставьте четкие цели - **Краткосрочные и долгосрочные цели.** Очертите, что вы хотите достичь в ближайшие дни, недели и месяцы. Это поможет сфокусироваться на важных задачах. - **SMART-цели.** Убедитесь, что ваши цели конкретные, измеримые, достижимые, реалистичные и временно ограниченные. # 2. Планирование - **Ежедневный и еженедельный план.** Вечером напишите список задач на следующий день и распределите задачи по приоритетам на неделю. - **Ограничивайте список задач.** Не перегружайте себя; оставьте время на непредвиденные дела и отдых. # 3. Осваивайте техники управления временем - **Метод Pomodoro.** Работайте 25 минут, затем делайте 5-минутный перерыв. После каждого четвертого цикла делайте более длинный перерыв. - **Метод двух минут.** Если задача занимает меньше двух минут, сделайте её сразу. - **Правило 80/20.** Помните, что 20% усилий часто приносят 80% результата. Сосредоточьтесь на самых важных задачах. # 4. Отслеживание времени - **Используйте таймеры и приложения.** Это поможет вам оставаться в рамках отведенного времени на задачу. - **Ведите дневник времени.** Записывайте, сколько времени занимает выполнение разных действий, чтобы лучше планировать будущие задачи. # 5. Избегайте многозадачности - Сосредоточьтесь на одной задаче за раз. Многозадачность часто ведет к снижению качества и увеличению времени на выполнение работы. # 6. Учитесь говорить \\"Нет\\" - Оценивайте, как задачи соотносятся с вашими целями и приоритетами, прежде чем браться за них. # 7. Создайте подходящую рабочую среду - Убедитесь, что ваше рабочее место комфортно и минимизирует отвлечения. # 8. Заботьтесь о себе - Полноценный сон, здоровое питание, физические упражнения и регулярные перерывы повышают эффективность и благополучие. # В заключение Не забывайте, что каждый человек уникален. Экспериментируйте с разными стратегиями и находите то, что лучше всего подходит именно вам. Не стесняйтесь обращаться за помощью к специалистам, если чувствуете, что не можете справиться самостоятельно."},{"instruction":"Спасибо за советы, но все они достаточно очевидные и известны мне. Я пишу себе цели и задачи на день, причем достаточно реалистичные, но все упирается в то, что я достаточно часто отвлекаюсь или увлекаюсь какой-нибудь одной задачей, а на остальные потом уже не остаётся времени или же получается так, что я засиживаюсь допоздна, и поддерживать режим сна не получается. Что может здесь помочь с психологической точки зрения","output":"Если вы замечаете, что несмотря на планирование и знание основ управления временем все равно сталкиваетесь с проблемами в виде отвлечений и увлеченности одной задачей, то возможно следует подумать о подходах, которые помогут с психологической точки зрения улучшить концентрацию и самодисциплину. # 1. Переосмысление отношения к задачам - **\\"Почему\\" вместо \\"Что\\".** Сфокусируйтесь на причинах, почему вам нужно выполнить задачу, а не просто на ее выполнении. Это может помочь увеличить мотивацию. - **Позитивное мышление.** Подходите к выполнению задачи с позитивной стороны, представляя положительные стороны и результаты ее завершения. # 2. Медитация и ментальные тренировки - **Медитация.** Практика медитации может помочь улучшить концентрацию, научиться управлять своими мыслями и снизить уровень стресса. - **Визуализация успеха.** Представьте себе, как вы успешно справляетесь со всеми задачами. Это может помотивировать и улучшить ваше отношение к выполнению задач. # 3. Разбиение задач на подзадачи - **Маленькие шаги.** Если ощущаете, что увлекаетесь одной задачей, попробуйте разбить ее на меньшие шаги. Это поможет ощутить прогресс и контроль над временем. # 4. Понимание и принятие собственных особенностей - **Уникальность методов.** Признайте, что у каждого свой ритм и методы работы. Для некоторых работа по таймеру эффективна, для других может подходить подход \\"работа — короткий отдых — работа\\". # 5. Установление четких границ - Ограничьте возможности для отвлечений. Если вы работаете дома, сообщите домашним, что в определенное время вы не должны быть потревожены. # 6. Обращение к специалисту - **Консультация с психологом.** Если испробовали различные методики, но ощущаете, что проблема глубже и связана, возможно, с прокрастинацией, тревогой или другими факторами, консультация с психологом может оказаться очень полезной. Наконец, важно понимать, что улучшение управления временем — это процесс, который требует времени и усилий. Не ругайте себя за неудачи или отвлечения. Лучше анализируйте их причины и извлекайте уроки для будущего. Ваш подход к работе и жизни вцелом будет совершенствоваться постепенно, если вы будете прилагать усилия и оставаться открытыми к изменениям."},{"instruction":"create a list paramecia devil fruit ideas","output":"Certainly!

You said what characters did, you quoted their dialogue, and, if need be, you told what they thought: “This is easy, Joe thought, as he ambled down the quay.” The only tricky thing here is knowing what a quay is. But then, as Virginia Woolf points out, “On or about December 1910, human nature changed.” Certainly the novelist’s relationship to consciousness did. As a result of huge changes in the scientific and philosophical understanding of the mind—the by-products of work by Freud and Jung and William James and Henri Bergson (who won a Nobel Prize in literature)—the depiction of consciousness became much more fluid. And messy. As a movement, stream of consciousness had a short tenure, only three decades or so. Yet it helped to define the modern novel, change how later writers approached character, and bewilder generations of English classes. But we’ll be bewildered no more. Or maybe just a little. So what is this beast, stream of consciousness? Oh, that’s easy: it doesn’t exist. Lot of help, right? Nevertheless, it’s true: there is no single thing to which we can point and say, “Stream of consciousness.” There are a lot of works that seem to fit the notion, but they’re hardly all doing the same thing. It’s a lot like obscenity: no one can define it, but everyone thinks he knows it when he sees it. Okay, we have something that may not exist, that no one has satisfactorily defined, that existed only briefly, and that tends to confuse readers. Where do I go to sign up? And can it possibly matter? Oh, yes, it matters greatly. On one level it matters because of all those bigwigs of modernism who attempted new things. They came, they went. But something stayed behind, and that something matters. Prior to the start of all this —let’s take Woolf’s 1910, plus or minus a few—readers and writers could automatically expect a certain level of authority in the telling of a tale. There was a narrative center that existed outside the characters in the tale. That center is easiest to see in the omniscient narrators of the great Victorian novels, whether Bleak House or Vanity Fair or Middlemarch. There is clearly an intelligence that exists external to the story, one that shapes the story and says, in effect, “We exist outside this story, but through my agency, we can go not only into the story but into the thoughts of the characters at will. That is, at my will.” That outside center, however, also exists in the first-person narratives. Outside? Of course, outside. The Pip who narrates Great Expectations is clearly separate from the child Pip who stumbles into the clutches of Magwitch at the novel’s opening. Most of his life to date has taken place in the intervening years. But he’s also separate from the Pip who talks to Joe Gargery about being a gentleman late in the novel and who has his final, memorable meeting with Estella. The narrating Pip exists both outside and after those character Pips. How can we be sure? Verb tense. The past tense of the narrative—not simple present or some progressive form—argues for distance from the events and the self within the narrative. So? How does that make a difference? It means everything we know about the character, and especially everything we know from the character is mediated. There’s a conscious presence imposed between us and young Pip or Esther Summerson filtering their thoughts—selecting, arranging, rewording—so that we know them only in this shaped, rather distant form. For all their variety, the one thing common to stream-of-consciousness novels is their desire to do away with that mediation, to get not merely close to but inside the characters’ heads. Swell idea, but where’s the road map? As it turns out, the woods in 1900 were just full of cartographers. As I said before, there is no single technique known as “stream of consciousness.” Rather, we use the term, very loosely, to describe the effects produced by a number of techniques, and more generally to describe a certain type of fiction that seeks to reproduce consciousness in all its complexity and with a minimum of narrative mediation. And while they differ considerably from one another, they have this in common: the loss of a narrative center outside character. Instead, narration began to find a home within characters’ minds, and not always the minds of which they were aware. Because, as it turns out, “mind” gives way to “consciousness,” and consciousness is composed of multiple levels. Pretty much everybody seems to have had this idea of depth at the same time. The term first arises in William James’s work The Principles of Psychology (1890), where he prefers it to “train” or “chain” of consciousness. The fluidity and continuum of depths suggested by “stream” make it more nearly ideal as a descriptor of James’s notion of consciousness. Some of his brother Henry’s late works begin to explore consciousness as operating simultaneously on a variety of levels, although none of them could be properly described as stream-of￾consciousness novels. So far so good, right? But here’s the thing: it had already begun to exist in practice. Two years earlier, Édouard Dujardin did something remarkable in his short novel, Les lauriers sont coupé (the first English translation: We’ll to the Woods No More, the second, The Bays Are Sere—clearly imprecise renderings). He employed, for the first time I believe, a technique that is recognizable as interior monologue. It’s a lot like a regular monologue except that it is unspoken, inside the head, and largely unshaped. What Dujardin recognizes at once is that thoughts go where they will, leap in ways that defy logic, and take on a life of their own. A drop of wine. Empty, the seats opposite; between the seat and the mirror, leather upholstery. I must see what happens with a note— anyway. My card-case; my address card, that’s more suitable; my pocket-pencil; very well. What shall I put? A rendezvous for tomorrow. I must indicate several. If that solid solicitor knew what I was up to! I write: ‘Tomorrow, at two, in the reading room of the Magasin du Louvre…’The Magasin du Louvre, not very chic, but still the most convenient; and then, or somewhere else? The Louvre? go on with you! At two o’clock. Need to allow enough time; at least from two till three; that’s it; I change ‘at’to ‘ from’ and I’m going to add ‘until three’. Next ‘I…I will wait for you…’No, ‘I will wait’; that’s it; let’s see. Perhaps not surprisingly for an experimental work, Dujardin’s novel lapsed into neglect and was largely forgotten in 1902 when Joyce stumbled across a copy in a bookseller’s shop in Tours, France. The impact is undeniable, for despite a twenty-year gap, Joyce copies Dujardin’s style exactly for many of Leopold Bloom’s monologues in Ulysses. Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch.

فرعی از کارهای فروید و یونگ و ویلیام جیمز و آنری برگسون (که جایزه نوبل ادبیات را برد) - تصویر آگاهی بسیار بیشتر روان و به هم ریخته شد. به عنوان یک جنبش، آگاهی جاری دوره کوتاهی داشت، فقط سی سال یا بیشتر. با وجود این، به تعریف رمان مدرن کمک کرد، تغییری در نحوه نزدیک شدن نویسندگان بعدی به شخصیت‌ها ایجاد کرد، و نسل‌هایی از کلاس‌های ادبیات انگلیسی را گیج کرد. اما دیگر گیج نخواهیم شد. یا شاید فقط کمی. پس این غول، آگاهی جاری، چیست؟ اوه، این آسان است: وجود ندارد. کمک زیادی، درست است؟ با این حال، واقعاً حقیقت دارد: چیز واحدی وجود ندارد که بتوانیم به آن اشاره کنیم و بگوییم، \\"آگاهی جاری.\\" کارهای زیادی وجود دارند که به نظر می‌رسد با این مفهوم مطابقت دارند، اما آنها به سختی همه یک کار را انجام می‌دهند. خیلی مثل فحشا: کسی نمی‌تواند آن را تعریف کند، اما هر کس فکر می‌کند هنگامی که آن را می‌بیند، می‌شناسد. خوب، ما چیزی داریم که ممکن است وجود نداشته باشد، که هیچکس به طور رضایت‌بخشی تعریف نکرده، که فقط به طور کوتاهی وجود داشته و تمایل دارد خوانندگان را گیج کند. کجا باید برای نام‌نویسی بروم؟ و آیا اصلاً اهمیت دارد؟ اوه، بله، بسیار اهمیت دارد. در یک سطح این اهمیت دارد به خاطر همه آن بزرگان مدرنیسم که تلاش‌های جدیدی کردند. آنها آمدند، رفتند. اما چیزی پشت سر ماند، و آن چیزی اهمیت دارد. پیش از آغاز همه اینها - بیایید 1910 وولف را بگیریم، به علاوه یا منهای چند - خوانندگان و نویسندگان می‌توانستند به طور خودکار انتظار سطحی از اقتدار در روایت یک داستان را داشته باشند. یک مرکز روایی وجود داشت که خارج از شخصیت‌ها در داستان وجود داشت. این مرکز در روایت‌های دانای کل نوول‌های بزرگ ویکتوریایی، چه خانه افسرده یا نمایش غرور یا میدلمارچ، به راحتی دیده می‌شود. قطعا یک هوشی وجود دارد که خارج از داستان وجود دارد، یکی که داستان را شکل می‌دهد و می‌گوید، در واقع، \\"ما خارج از این داستان وجود داریم، اما از طریق نمایندگی من، ما می‌توانیم نه تنها وارد داستان شویم بلکه به دلخواه به افکار شخصیت‌ها وارد شویم. یعنی، به خواست من.\\" اما این مرکز خارجی، همچنین در روایت‌های شخص اول وجود دارد. خارج؟ البته، خارج. پیپی که انتظارات بزرگ را روایت می‌کند، قطعا از پیپ کودکی که در ابتدای رمان به دام مگویچ افتاد، جدا است. بیشتر زندگی‌اش تا به امروز در سال‌های میانی اتفاق افتاده است. اما او همچنین از پیپی که در اواخر رمان با جو گارگری درباره بودن یک آقا صحبت می‌کند و که دیدار نهایی، به یادماندنی خود را با استلا دارد، جدا است. پیپ روایت‌کننده هم خارج و هم پس از آن پیپهای شخصیت وجود دارد. چگونه مطمئن باشیم؟ زمان فعل. زمان گذشته روایت - نه حال ساده یا برخی از اشکال پیشرو - برای فاصله از رویدادها و خود درون روایت دلیل می‌آورد. پس؟ این چگونه تفاوتی ایجاد می‌کند؟ همه چیزی که درباره شخصیت می‌دانیم، و به خصوص همه چیزی که از شخصیت می‌دانیم، میانجی‌گری شده است. یک حضور آگاهانه بین ما و پیپ جوان یا استر سامرسون وجود دارد که افکار آن‌ها را فیلتر می‌کند - انتخاب می‌کند، مرتب می‌کند، بازنویسی می‌کند - به طوری که فقط آنها را در این شکل شکل‌داده‌شده، تا حدی دور می‌شناسیم. با وجود تنوع آنها، یک چیز مشترک به رمان‌های آگاهی جاری این است که آنها می‌خواهند آن میانجی‌گری را حذف کنند، تا نه تنها به نزدیکی بلکه به داخل سر شخصیت‌ها بروند. ایده عالی، اما نقشه راه کجاست؟ همانطور که از بیرون معلوم است، جنگل‌ها در سال 1900 پر از نقشه‌کش‌ها بود. همانطور که قبلاً گفتم، هیچ تکنیک واحدی به عنوان \\"آگاهی جاری\\" وجود ندارد. بلکه، ما اصطلاح را، به طور خیلی آزاد، برای توصیف اثرات تولید شده توسط چندین تکنیک استفاده می‌کنیم و به طور کلی برای توصیف نوعی داستان که سعی دارد آگاهی را در همه پیچیدگی‌هایش و با حداقل میانجی‌گری روایی بازتولید کند. و در حالی که آنها از یکدیگر به طور قابل توجهی متفاوت هستند، این مورد را مشترک دارند: از دست دادن یک مرکز روایی خارج از شخصیت. به جای آن، روایت شروع به یافتن خانه در درون ذهن شخصیت‌ها کرد، و نه همیشه ذهنی که آنها از آن آگاه بودند. زیرا، همانطور که از قرار معلوم، \\"ذهن\\" به \\"آگاهی\\" تبدیل می‌شود، و آگاهی از چندین سطح تشکیل شده است. تقریباً همه به نظر می‌رسد همزمان این ایده عمق را داشتند. اصطلاح اولین بار در کار ویلیام جیمز، اصول روان‌شناسی (1890)، مطرح می‌شود، جایی که او به آن ترجیح می‌دهد به جای \\"قطار\\" یا \\"زنجیر\\" آگاهی. روانی و پیوستگی عمق‌های پیشنهاد شده توسط \\"جریان\\" آن را به عنوان یک ویژگی‌دهنده بیشتر نزدیک به مفهوم جیمز از آگاهی ایده‌آل می‌سازد. برخی از آثار دیرینه برادرش هنری شروع به کاوش در آگاهی به عنوان عملی که همزمان در تنوعی از سطوح عمل می‌کند می‌کنند، اگرچه هیچ‌کدام از آنها را نمی‌توان به درستی به عنوان رمان‌های آگاهی جاری توصیف کرد. تا به اینجا خوب است، درست است؟ اما اینجا چیزی است: این قبلاً شروع به وجود آمده بود. دو سال زودتر، ادوار دوژاردن کار قابل توجهی انجام داد، در رمان کوتاه خود، لوریه‌ها بریده شده‌اند (اولین ترجمه انگلیسی: دیگر به جنگل نخواهیم رفت، دومین، خلیج‌ها خشک شده‌اند - قطعاً بازنمایی‌های نادقیق). او، برای اولین بار به نظر می‌رسد، از یک تکنیک قابل شناسایی به عنوان مونولوگ درونی استفاده کرد. خیلی شبیه یک مونولوگ معمولی به جز اینکه گفته نشده، درون سر است، و عمدتاً بدون شکل است. آنچه دوژاردن بلافاصله متوجه می‌شود این است که افکار به جایی می‌روند که خواهند، به روش‌هایی پرش می‌کنند که منطق را نقض می‌کنند، و زندگی خودشان را به دست می‌گیرند. یک قطره شراب. خالی، صندلی‌های روبرو؛ بین صندلی و آینه، روکش چرمی. باید ببینم با یک یادداشت چه می‌شود -

Однако при этом страдает режим сна и сам сон соответственно. Как мне решить эту проблему. Помоги пожалуйста","output":"Ваша проблема довольно распространенная и связана с понятием \\"местьенное маргинализованное время\\" или \\"revenge bedtime procrastination\\", которое описывает ситуацию, когда люди откладывают сон, чтобы заниматься приятными или интересными для себя вещами, потому что днем не ощущают возможности заниматься собой. Вот несколько советов, как справиться с этой проблемой: 1. **Планирование времени**. Попробуйте планировать свой день так, чтобы у вас было достаточно времени для занятий, которые вам нравятся и которые помогут вам расслабиться и зарядиться энергией. Составьте расписание, включающее ваши обязанности и время на отдых. 2. **Установка четкого режима сна**. Постарайтесь ложиться и вставать в одно и то же время каждый день, включая выходные. Это поможет настроить ваше тело на регулярный график сна. 3. **Предсоновые ритуалы**. Разработайте для себя спокойные предсоновые ритуалы, которые помогут вам расслабиться перед сном. Это может быть чтение книги, прослушивание спокойной музыки, медитация или легкие упражнения растяжки. 4. **Ограничение использования электронных устройств**. Постарайтесь избегать использования телефонов, компьютеров и других экранов за час до сна. Синий свет от экранов может подавлять выработку мелатонина и ухудшать качество вашего сна. 5. **Оценка вашего дня**. Попытайтесь найти причины, по которым вы чувствуете, что ваш день был недостаточно насыщенным или удовлетворительным. Могут ли быть какие-то изменения в вашем распорядке дня, которые помогли бы вам чувствовать себя более удовлетворенным и эффективным? 6. **Эксперименты с хобби или занятиями**. Иногда помогает расширение кругозора или поиск новых хобби, которые могли бы приносить радость и чувство удовлетворения без необходимости жертвовать сном. 7. **Консультация со специалистом**. Если соблюдение вышеуказанных советов не помогает и проблема сохраняется, возможно стоит обратиться к специалисту (психологу или сомнологу) для поиска индивидуального решения.

そしてマルクスに残る不備を是正し、労働力商品の特殊性の明確化から、この問題の解決に道を拓いたのが、宇野弘蔵の原理論研究であた。宇野は、労働力商品化の矛盾の把握を根本に、『資本論』を原理論として純化·再編したが、そこではじめて労働力の価値と使用価值も資本の蓄積過程で(1)決定されることが明らかにされたのである。いわば純経済的に規定されうることが明確にされたのであるが、それは当然のことながら宇野理論における科学とイデォロギーとの峻別に対応していた。 小論は、宇野理論の継承上で、労働日の決定メカニズムの論証を図ったが、そこからは当然労働日規定からの階級闘争および法·国家的な契機の排除が結論されることになろう。 この結論は、階級闘争の有する意義を貶めるものではない。むしろ逆である。では、労働日が純経くびき済的に規定されるということは、一体何を意味するのか。それは、労働者階級が資本の軛から解放され、労働日や「賃金」を自ら決定するためには、労働力商品化の廃棄が絶対的条件となることを指示していよう。階級対立そのものの止揚をまつて、はじめて自由時間と労働時間との対立の揚棄が実現され、「真実の経済··.は、労働時間の節約にある」というテーゼが直接活きてくる。いわばそこでのみ人間は「時の主人」すなわち歴史の主体になりえるのである。そこでは、経済活動が人間本来の目的追求のための手段として位置づけられ、「本来的な費用」にすぎない人間の労働日の節約·短縮が、意識的に企てられることになろう。資本主義における労働の生産力の発展が、決して労働日の短縮に結びつかないことと対比すれば、かかる事態の有する決定的な意義は明白である。自由時間の拡大が人間解放の基礎条件をなす限りで、労働日の短縮が「人間にとってもっとも重要な課題」となるが、その実現のためには資本主義の廃棄すなわち労働日の運動法則からの解放が達成されなければならない。すべての経済は結局は「時間の経済」に帰着するが、法則を廃棄した社会ではじめて「時間の経済」は人間の自主的＝意識的なコントロールのもとに服することになる。 これにたいし、資本主義体制の内部での、労働日をめぐる労働者の闘争は、賃金などをめぐる経済闘争と同じく、労働者の生活水準を向上させるための闘争として位置づけられよう。いわば労働日の短縮→生活時間の増大は、労働者が、そこでプチ·プルジョア的意識や消費的なレジャー文化に毒されないかぎり、彼の階級的および人間的成長を促すものとして、その意味を明らかにされるのである。いわばそれは、労働者に、社会を自主的に運営していく主体としての能力を養成するかぎりで、将来の人間解放のための物質的かつ時間的な基礎をなすものといえよう。 労働日規定の完成は、体制変革とその主体を基本的に明らかにすると同時に、その窮極目標との関連で労働条件をめぐる階級闘争の有する位相を明確にし、社会主義運動の展開に科学的な根拠を提供することになる。これに反し、階級闘争を力說するマハト·テオリーは、逆說的に、労働者の生活改善のための経済闘争をそれ自身自己目的化し、社会主義を改良主義に解消しかねないのである。”翻译为中文","output":"“但是，劳动力商品的价值规定和使用价值规定在《资本论》中并未得到充分阐明。可以看到经济外部的规定混入和阶级斗争逻辑的残留。可以说，即使是经过马克思大约三十年的努力，科学与意识形态的关系问题也未能得到正确的解决。 而修正了马克思遗留下来的不足、从劳动力商品的特殊性明确化着手、为这个问题的解决开辟了道路的，是宇野弘藏的原理论研究。宇野以劳动力商品化的矛盾理解为基础，将《资本论》纯化·重编为原理论，在那里首次明确了劳动力的价值和使用价值是在资本积累过程中确定的。也就是说，明确了可以纯粹经济地规定的事项，这自然而然地对应于宇野理论中科学与意识形态的严格区分。 本论文在继承宇野理论的基础上，试图论证劳动日的决定机制，由此自然会得出从劳动日规定中排除阶级斗争以及法律·国家的契机的结论。 这个结论并非减损了阶级斗争的意义。相反，那么，劳动日被纯经济地规定，究竟意味着什么呢？这意味着，要想劳动者阶级从资本的枷锁中解放出来，由自己决定劳动日和“工资”，必须绝对地废弃劳动力商品化。只有等到阶级对立本身的超越，才能实现自由时间与劳动时间对立的消除，直接体现“真正的经济……在于节省劳动时间”的论断。这样人类才能成为“时间的主人”，即历史的主体。在这里，经济活动被定位为追求人类本身目的的手段，人类劳动日的节约·缩短将被有意识地策划。与资本主义下劳动生产力的发展决不与劳动日缩短相连的情况对比下，这种情况具有的决定性意义是显而易见的。只要自由时间的扩展构成了人类解放的基础条件，劳动日的缩短成为“对人类来说最重要的任务”，但为了实现它，必须完成资本主义的废除，即从劳动日的运动法则中解放出来。所有的经济最终都归结为“时间的经济”，在废除了法则的社会中，“时间的经济”才首次服从于人类自主的=有意识的控制。 相对于在资本主义体系内部，围绕劳动日的工人斗争，就像是围绕工资等的经济斗争一样，定位为提高工人生活水平的斗争。可以说，劳动日缩短→生活时间增大，在工人尚未被小资产阶级意识或消费性休闲文化所毒害的情况下，将其阶级和人的成长促进作为其意义明确化。这可以说是，在一定程度上为工人培养成为自主管理社会的主体的能力，为未来人类解放奠定物质和时间的基础。 劳动日规定的完成，同时在体制转变及其主体方面做出基本澄清，且在与其最终目标的关联中明确了围绕劳动条件的阶级斗争所具有的相位，为社会主义运动的展开提供科学依据。相反，大力讲述阶级斗争的马哈特理论，反讽地，可能将工人的生活改善的经济斗争自行目的化，从而将社会主义解消为改良主义。”"},{"instruction":"请将“（1）「いわゆる窮乏化の法則について」、「労働力の価値と価格-労働力商品の特殊性について」、「恐慌論の課題」など、一連の宇野の論文を参照。 （2）初期のマルクスとェンゲルスは、社会主義を＜疎外された労働＞からの解放としてとらえたため、社会主義にあっては労働は人間的本質をなすものとして、疎外されない、協同の類的活動になるとする見方をとつていた。生産的労働は苦痛から喜びにかわり、自己の人間的成長と社会的存在を確認するための本来的な活動になるとされたのである。これは、フーリェの労働＝遊戯論とヘーゲルの労働＝人間本質論を統一した哲学的な社会主義観といえよう。 だが、『経済学批判要綱』での労働力商品の概念化を契機、経済原則（＝「労働一般」）と経済法則（＝「資本の生産過程」）が区別され、資本主義的生産の特殊歴史的性格が科学的に認識されてくると、先の社会主義観も修正されることになる。経済活動は人間本来の目的を追求するための手段とされ、生産的労働は短縮·節約されるべき「費用」と位置づけられることになるのである。もっとも、労働を広義に解釈し、対象化活動一般（=人間の本質的諸力の外化→主体と疎外態との緊張→自己への奪回）として把握すれば、後期マルクスは悪しき科学主義＝経済主義として批判されるかもしれない。しかし、それは人間活動一般にしめる経済活動の意義を理解しない一種の浪漫派社会主義といわなければならない。現代の「社会主義」諸国の後退現象（＝市場経済の肯定、経済効率の重視と生産力主義など）が逆說的に示しているように、社会主義の成立には、生産力の継承と労働条件の自主的決定かつ社会的労働の合理的配分が不可欠なのである。社会主義では、冷徹な眼をもって、労働日の縮減自由時間の増大が図られなければならない。”翻译为中文","output":"（1）请参考宇野的一系列论文，如“所谓贫困化法则”、“劳动力的价值与价格——劳动力商品的特殊性”、“恐慌论的任务”等。

但是，随着在《经济学批评大纲》中对劳动力商品概念的确立，经济原则（=“劳动一般”）与经济法则（=“资本的生产过程”）被区分开来，资本主义生产的特殊历史性质开始被科学地认识，之前的社会主义观念也随之得到修正。经济活动被视为追求人的本来目的的手段，生产性劳动被认为是应当被缩短、节约的“费用”。当然，如果将劳动广义地理解，作为对象化活动一般（=人的本质力量的外化→主体与异化状态的紧张→自我回收），后期马克思也许会被批评为恶劣的科学主义=经济主义。但这必须被视为一种不理解经济活动在人类活动中所占意义的浪漫主义社会主义。 正如当代“社会主义”国家的退步现象（=市场经济的肯定、经济效率的重视和生产力主义等）逆向地表明的那样，社会主义的建立，必须继承生产力和自主决定劳动条件以及社会劳动的合理分配是不可或缺的。在社会主义中，必须冷静地计划劳动日的减少和自由时间的增加。"},{"instruction":"Note: This is in an alternate universe, This shop, despite

for shopping with us for so many years, You can find all about KikoRiki and its related online MMO RolyPolyLand at riki.com Goodbye forever… This sign was posted to the doors of Riki, a children’s shop in Glasgow on Wednesday The image ends with a poignant “Goodbye forever…” above a image of a crying Krash the Rabbit The store closed on Wedensday after 12 years trading at Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow The shop sold merchandise related to the animated series KikoRiki, The cartoon is a Russian cartoon about circular colorful animals and their fun adventures, The Riki shop opened in 1995 was originally Golden Adventures and was a general toy shop akin to Toys R Us but in 2003 became Riki and became focused on the then new surge in KikoRiki popularity in Scotland, However in June 2007, the store closed for the last time, Riki Group’s reasoning was the “realities of retail” was unavoidable, The shop was also closed so Riki could focus on business in it’s native Russia and develop more exciting new animated series or movies Hidden Glasgow - Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric.

For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki.

Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey. Write the ad, with the final words being “goodbye forever…” with “The fun doesn’t have to end here, Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik”, shown below The logos and web adresses “stv.tv” “itv.com/citv” and “toonattik.tv” are shown below, Incidentally RolyPolyLand is not mentioned at all [Scene opens with a slow, gentle pan across the empty interior of the once vibrant Riki store on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. The shelf spaces are bare, and the colorful decor appears faded without the laughter and chatter of children. Soft, melancholic music plays in the background.] Narrator (soft, nostalgic tone): “For years, Riki has been more than just a shop. It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here. Continue the adventures and laughter with your favorite characters.” [The screen now displays the current logos of STV and CITV, alongside the Toonattik logo, with web addresses neatly listed below each logo:] - STV: stv.tv - CITV: itv.com/citv - Toonattik: toonattik.tv Narrator: “Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik, and keep the spirit of Riki alive.” [The music gently fades as the screen transitions to black, ending with a final soft echo of the store’s theme melody.] Narrator (whisper): “Thank you, and take care, wherever you are.” [End of Ad.] Write a tweet where a user notices that on the Cinema rip posted by “Hall of Advertising” in 2016 you can clearly see the logos, whereas on the original video uploaded in 2007, the logos look like a blue blob, a dark blue and cream blob and a blue yellow, white and pink blob respectively User: @NostalgiaJunkie85 “Just watched the cinema rip of the Riki store goodbye ad on 'Hall of Advertising’s 2016 post and wow, what a difference! 🎥👀 You can actually see the STV, CITV, and Toonattik logos CLEARLY, unlike in the original 2007 upload where they were just mysterious blobs of color. Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. — Write a blog post from the Royal Concert Hall in June 2007 titled \\"The Most Sad Task of Our Lives\\" and explain the situation","output":"As I sit here, surrounded by the grandeur and beauty of the Royal Concert Hall, I find myself faced with what feels like the most somber task of our lives. The closure of the beloved Riki store, a place that brought so much joy and laughter to countless children and families, has left a void in our hearts and in the very fabric of our community. The memories of the vibrant KikoRiki characters adorning the shelves, the sound of children's laughter echoing through the aisles, and the sense of wonder and excitement that filled the air can still be felt, even as the store now stands empty and silent. The final moments of Riki, captured in the closing ad with Krash shedding a tear and the haunting lullaby playing in the background, are etched in our minds as a poignant farewell to a cherished part of Glasgow's history. The decision to close the store was not an easy one, but the realities of retail and the changing landscape of shopping in our city made it unavoidable. The staff, who poured their hearts and souls into creating a magical experience for every visitor, now face the uncertain future that comes with the closure of a beloved establishment. And yet, even in this moment of sadness and loss, there is a glimmer of hope. The memories of Riki, the stories shared, and the experiences had within those walls will forever be a part of our collective history. The spirit of Riki lives on in the hearts of all who were touched by its magic, and the legacy of the store will continue to inspire and bring joy to generations to come. As we bid farewell to Riki, let us hold onto the memories, the laughter, and the sense of wonder that it brought into our lives. May we carry the spirit of Riki with us always, remembering the joy it brought and the community it fostered. Goodbye, Riki, you will be deeply missed, but your legacy will live on in the hearts of all who knew and loved you."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo where Clyde 1 ceases FM transmission in 2030 to go DAB and online only, Riki fans are surprised at the last thing the FM frequency played before going into a retune announcement loop.","output":"Thread Title: End of an Era: Clyde 1 Ceases FM Transmission --- User1: RadioFanatic Did anyone catch the news that Clyde 1 has officially ceased FM transmission and will now be available only on DAB and online?

The Louvre? go on with you! At two o’clock. Need to allow enough time; at least from two till three; that’s it; I change ‘at’to ‘ from’ and I’m going to add ‘until three’. Next ‘I…I will wait for you…’No, ‘I will wait’; that’s it; let’s see. Perhaps not surprisingly for an experimental work, Dujardin’s novel lapsed into neglect and was largely forgotten in 1902 when Joyce stumbled across a copy in a bookseller’s shop in Tours, France. The impact is undeniable, for despite a twenty-year gap, Joyce copies Dujardin’s style exactly for many of Leopold Bloom’s monologues in Ulysses. Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I’d like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners, riveted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this. Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don’t you know? In the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can’t he hear the difference? Think he’s that way inclined a bit. Against my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse. Suppose she wouldn’t let herself be vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife. Part of being a genius is knowing when you’ve found a winner. What the interior monologue does for Joyce is allow him—and us—to follow the meanderings of his characters, especially Leopold Bloom, who is a world-class meanderer. Of his wife Molly, more anon. The intellectual sanction for this new fiction is largely derived from the work of French philosopher Henri Bergson. In works such as Matter and Memory, Laughter, and Time and Free Will, Bergson lays out a theory of mind, memory, and the subjective experience of time that gives free reign to the novelistic explorers of consciousness. At the center of experience in the “new” fiction is memory. Bergson distinguishes between mémoire volontaire, which is a product of reason and will, the portion of memory we can control, and mémoire involontaire, which is the part writers can make use of. This latter is capricious, flowing uncertainly, never quite graspable. We see when we look at writing by Joyce or Woolf, for instance, just how much of memory is involuntary, how little control we have over the images that float to the surface, often to haunt or mock us. Another key notion is la durée, or durational time. As opposed to clock time or metronomic time, humans experience time subjectively, so that moments are almost infinitely elastic, as in the instant before the car crash when one “sees” one’s life flash before one’s eyes. The notion of durational time, curiously enough, is picked up by the imagist poets for their tiny creations and by novelists with ambitions as large as the author of Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. In the practice of fiction, durational time allows for almost limitless exploration of a single moment, as the mind can be functioning on a host of levels and covering a wide array of subjects all at once as time seems, at least sometimes, to stand still. The change in the narrative presence is most notable in the stream-of￾consciousness novel. This is not to suggest, however, that narrators disappear entirely; rather, the narrator ceases to act as mediator or filter for the characters’ thoughts and acts more as presenter or conduit for direct transcription, with little or no authorial commentary. Where Dickens would tell us what someone was thinking and what it might mean or portend, Faulkner or Joyce give us not only the thoughts (the word suggesting an awareness and even a control by the character), but the whole jumble of thought, instinct, pre-thought, reflex, and response to stimulus to which the character is subject. In stream-ofconsciousness fiction a character’s thoughts are presented directly, without mediation by an intrusive narrator; he speaks, as it were, to himself. Hence the use of contractions and of the second person. The effect of the latter is to give what is said a more general significance, the speaker assuming that his reactions and thoughts do not hold for him alone but for any human being.","output":"اما همچنان راحت‌ترین راه است؛ پس، در کجا؟ لوور؟ ادامه بده! ساعت دو. باید وقت کافی در نظر گرفت؛ حداقل از دو تا سه؛ همینه؛ من \\"در\\" را به \\"از\\" تغییر می‌دهم و \\"تا سه\\" را اضافه می‌کنم. بعدی \\"من...من منتظر تو خواهم بود...\\" نه، \\"من منتظر خواهم بود\\"؛ همینه؛ ببینیم. شاید نه چندان عجیب برای یک اثر تجربی، رمان دوژاردن به فراموشی سپرده شد و تقریباً در سال ۱۹۰۲، زمانی که جویس نسخه‌ای را در یک کتابفروشی در شهر تور فرانسه پیدا کرد، به کلی فراموش شده بود. تأثیر انکارناپذیر است، زیرا با وجود فاصله‌ای بیست ساله، جویس سبک دوژاردن را دقیقاً برای بسیاری از منولوگ‌های لئوپولد بلوم در اولیس کپی می‌کند. آن حقه مرا به خواب نینداخت. لمس سریع. نشان نرم. کارم را دوست دارم. کیف دستی که علاقه خاصی به آن دارم. چرمی. گوشه‌های کلاه دار، لبه‌های میخکوب، قفل دو کاره. باب کاولی سال گذشته برای کنسرت قایقرانی ویکلو به او قرض داد و از آن روز تا به حال خبری از آن نشده است. آقای بلوم به سمت خیابان برونزویک قدم زنان، لبخند زد. همسرم تازه یکی گرفته. سوپرانوی ریزبند با لکه‌های کک و مک. بینی مثل تراشه پنیر. تا حدی خوبه: برای یک ترانه کوچک. شیرجه‌ای در آن نیست. تو و من، می‌دانی؟ در یک قایق هستیم. خوش‌زبانی. بهت سوزنی خواهد زد. نمی‌تواند تفاوت را بشنود؟ فکر می‌کند که او کمی به آن سمت متمایل است. به نظر من از راست به چپه. فکر می‌کردم بلفاست او را جلب کند. امیدوارم آبله بالای شهر بدتر نشود. فرض کن همسرت دیگر خودش را واکسینه نکند. همسر تو و همسر من. بخشی از بودن یک نابغه دانستن زمانی است که برنده‌ای پیدا می‌کنی. آنچه مونولوگ درونی برای جویس انجام می‌دهد این است که او و ما را قادر می‌سازد تا دنباله‌ی فکری شخصیت‌هایش، بخصوص لئوپولد بلوم که در همین کار دنیایی است، دنبال کنیم. درباره همسرش مولی، بعداً بیشتر خواهیم گفت. تأیید فکری برای این داستان جدید به طور عمده از آثار فیلسوف فرانسوی هانری برگسون ناشی می‌شود. در آثاری مانند ماده و حافظه، خنده، و زمان و اراده آزاد، برگسون یک نظریه درباره ذهن، حافظه و تجربه ذهنی زمان را ارائه می‌دهد که راه را بر کاوشگران رمانی از آگاهی باز می‌کند. در مرکز تجربه در داستان \\"جدید\\" حافظه قرار دارد. برگسون بین حافظه داوطلبانه، که محصول عقل و اراده است، بخشی از حافظه که می‌توانیم کنترل کنیم، و حافظه ناخواسته، که بخشی است که نویسندگان می‌توانند از آن استفاده کنند، تمایز قائل می‌شود. این دومی سرکش است، به‌طور نامطمئنی جاری می‌شود، هرگز کاملاً قابل درک نیست. وقتی به نوشته‌های جویس یا وولف نگاه می‌کنیم، می‌بینیم که چقدر از حافظه ناخواسته است، چقدر کنترل کمی بر تصاویری داریم که به سطح می‌آیند، غالباً برای تسخیر یا مسخره کردن ما. یک مفهوم کلیدی دیگر la durée، یا زمان مداوم است. در مقابل زمان ساعت یا زمان مترونومی، انسان‌ها زمان را به‌صورت ذهنی تجربه می‌کنند، به‌طوری که لحظات تقریباً بی‌نهایت انعطاف‌پذیر هستند، همان‌طور که در لحظه قبل از تصادف اتومبیل، کسی \\"زندگی‌اش را پیش چشمش می‌بیند\\". مفهوم زمان مداوم، به طور عجیبی، توسط شاعران تصویری برای آفرینش‌های کوچکشان و توسط رمان‌نویسانی با آرزوهایی به بزرگی نویسنده اولیس و بیداری فینگنز، برداشته شده است. در عمل داستان‌نویسی، زمان مداوم امکان کاوش تقریباً نامحدود یک لحظه را فراهم می‌کند، زیرا ذهن می‌تواند در یک میزبان از سطوح عمل کند و موضوعات متنوعی را همزمان پوشش دهد در حالی که زمان، حداقل گاهی اوقات، به نظر می‌رسد که ایستاده است. تغییر در حضور روایت در رمان جریان‌سازی آگاهی بسیار قابل توجه است. این به این معنا نیست که راویان کاملاً ناپدید می‌شوند؛ بلکه راوی دیگر به عنوان میانجی یا فیلتر برای افکار شخصیت‌ها عمل نمی‌کند و بیشتر به عنوان ارائه‌دهنده یا کانال برای نقل مکتوب مستقیم، با کمترین یا بدون تفسیر نویسنده عمل می‌کند. جایی که دیکنز به ما می‌گفت که کسی چه فکری می‌کرد و این ممکن است چه معنایی یا پیش‌بینی داشته باشد، فاکنر یا جویس نه تنها افکار (کلمه‌ای که نشان‌دهنده آگاهی و حتی کنترل توسط شخصیت است)، بلکه تمام هرج و مرج فکر، غریزه، پیش‌فکر، رفلکس و پاسخ به محرکاتی که شخصیت تحت آن قرار دارد را به ما می‌دهند. در داستان‌نویسی جریان آگاهی، افکار یک شخصیت مستقیماً بدون میانجی‌گری یک راوی مزاحم ارائه می‌شوند؛ او به نوعی با خودش صحبت می‌کند. از این رو، استفاده از کوتاه‌نویسی‌ها و خطاب به شخص دوم. تأثیر این آخری این است که چیزی که گفته می‌شود اهمیت عمومی بیشتری پیدا می‌کند، گوینده فرض می‌کند که واکنش‌ها و افکارش تنها برای او نیست، بلکه برای هر انسانی صادق است."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's a revised version of your \`merge_valid_files\` function that first ensures the 'Date' columns in both \`combined_df\` and each extra data DataFrame have the same timezone-aware or timezone-naive datatypes before attempting to merge them. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import os def merge_valid_files(combined_df, valid_extras_directory): df_merged = None first = True # Attempt to standardize the 'Date' column in the primary dataframe if combined_df['Date'].dt.tz is not None: # Ensure 'Date' is timezone-aware in UTC combined_df['Date'] = combined_df['Date'].dt.tz_convert('UTC') else: # Ensure 'Date' is timezone-naive combined_df['Date'] = combined_df['Date'].dt.tz_localize(None) for valid_extra in os.listdir(valid_extras_directory): if valid_extra.endswith(\\".csv\\"): valid_extra_path = os.path.join(valid_extras_directory, valid_extra) extra_data = pd.read_csv(valid_extra_path) # Convert 'Date' to datetime extra_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(extra_data['Date']) # Standardize 'Date' according to combined_df setup if combined_df['Date'].dt.tz is not None: # Ensure 'Date' is timezone-aware in UTC extra_data['Date'] = extra_data['Date'].dt.tz_convert('UTC') else: # Ensure 'Date' is timezone-naive extra_data['Date'] = extra_data['Date'].dt.tz_localize(None) if first: df_merged = combined_df.merge(extra_data, how='left', on='Date') first = False else: df_merged = df_merged.merge(extra_data, how='left', on='Date') return df_merged \`\`\` Note: This function now expects an additional parameter \`valid_extras_directory\`, which should be the path to the directory containing the valid CSV files you wish to merge. This change assumes that \`valid_extras_directory\` will be passed when calling the function, rather than relying on it being defined elsewhere as a global variable. This modified function tries to align the \`Date\` column in all dataframes to be either all timezone-aware in the UTC timezone or all timezone-naive before performing the merge operations. Make sure that converting all \`Date\` columns to UTC or removing the timezone information altogether is appropriate for your use case."},{"instruction":"Note: This is in an alternate universe, This shop, despite being awesome, never existed, It does in this alternate universe, Also sorry for constantly showing you this, I’m just trying to make sure its perfect We’ve loved being in this spot as part of the wonderful Glasgow community Unfortunately, This shop is now closed, The realities of retail in the shopping landscape has made this decision unavoidable, We want to take the opportunity to thank you for shopping with us for so many years, You can find all about KikoRiki and its related online MMO RolyPolyLand at riki.com Goodbye forever… This sign was posted to the doors of Riki, a children’s shop in Glasgow on Wednesday The image ends with a poignant “Goodbye forever…” above a image of a crying Krash the Rabbit The store closed on Wedensday after 12 years trading at Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow The shop sold merchandise related to the animated series KikoRiki, The cartoon is a Russian cartoon about circular colorful animals and their fun adventures, The Riki shop opened in 1995 was originally Golden Adventures and was a general toy shop akin to Toys R Us but in 2003 became Riki and became focused on the then new surge in KikoRiki popularity in Scotland, However in June 2007, the store closed for the last time, Riki Group’s reasoning was the “realities of retail” was unavoidable, The shop was also closed so Riki could focus on business in it’s native Russia and develop more exciting new animated series or movies Hidden Glasgow - Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully. For the latest on this story and more, follow Glasgow Times Online” So the store was saved due to its significance, but what will happen now that it’s now shut down?, It’s been locked and abandoned since 23 June 2007, And it still looks as sad and lonely as it did after closure, I long to see it full of life once again, I really want it back. They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. — Write a blog post on June 23 2007 about that they got there just before closing time, and heard the final moments, and then, the dreaded sign was put up","output":"Title: A Bittersweet Goodbye: Reflecting on the Closure of the Riki Store Date: June 23, 2007 As I arrived at the Riki store just before closing time today, I could sense a palpable sadness lingering in the air.

Hopefully, there's a way to honor the past while embracing the future, creating a space for both the old and the new to coexist harmoniously. Let's keep our fingers crossed for a balanced and inclusive approach in Glasgow's evolving cultural landscape."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up in 2027 where a user updates the situation on the characters","output":"User6: GlasgowUpdate Hello everyone, I wanted to provide an update on the situation with the Riki gang characters that we were all so fond of. It seems that despite the initial concerns back in 2024, the Riki gang has continued to be a beloved presence in Glasgow. The city has found a way to honor both the old and the new, striking a balance that celebrates the rich history and culture of the characters while embracing the fresh energy of the new mascots and campaigns. I'm happy to report that the Riki gang has not faded into obscurity as some feared. Instead, they have evolved with the times, finding new ways to engage with the community and remain relevant in the ever-changing cultural landscape of Glasgow. It's heartening to see that the city has found a way to preserve the legacy of the Riki gang while welcoming new faces and initiatives. This update serves as a reminder that change doesn't have to mean forgetting the past. With a thoughtful and balanced approach, Glasgow has managed to honor its history while embracing the opportunities for growth and innovation. The Riki gang continues to hold a special place in the hearts of many, serving as a bridge between the city's heritage and its future. As we move forward, let's celebrate the diversity, resilience, and creativity that define Glasgow's cultural tapestry. The coexistence of the old and the new is a testament to the city's ability to adapt, evolve, and thrive while remaining true to its roots. Here's to the Riki gang and all the characters that have shaped Glasgow's story - may they continue to enchant and inspire generations to come."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo where McDonalds closes a store in Renfield Street, a user thinks it will get a new tenant soon, while another shares \\"horror stories\\" of still empty units, including BHS (closed in 2016) and of course, Wiki","output":"User1: RenfieldStreetWatcher Did anyone notice that the McDonald's on Renfield Street has closed down? I wonder what will take its place. Any predictions on what the new tenant might be? User2: CityCentreObserver I did hear about the McDonald's closure. It's always interesting to see what new businesses or ventures pop up in these vacant spaces. Renfield Street is a prime location, so I'm sure it won't stay empty for long. Exciting times ahead! User3: LocalBusinessInsider You know, it's not always guaranteed that these units will get new tenants quickly. The BHS store that closed back in 2016 is still sitting empty, and Wiki, the children's store that closed down years ago, remains vacant too. There are often horror stories of businesses struggling to fill these spaces. Let's hope this one doesn't stay empty for too long! User4: GlasgowRetailWatcher It's a shame to see these once vibrant stores sitting empty for so long. Renfield Street is a bustling area, so it's surprising that units like BHS and Wiki haven't found new tenants yet. Let's hope that the closure of McDonald's doesn't add to the list of empty units in the area. Keeping our fingers crossed for some new businesses to breathe life back into these spaces."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where Wiki rhymes with quite possibly THE worst offender in terms of continued vacancy, and everyone becomes a bit more downbeat saying its still empty","output":"User5: GlasgowLament It's disheartening to see that Wiki has become quite possibly THE worst offender in terms of continued vacancy in Renfield Street. Despite the bustling energy of the area, this once vibrant children's store sits empty, its doors closed and its shelves bare. The lingering vacancy is a stark reminder of the challenges businesses face in finding new tenants and revitalizing these spaces. User6: CityCentreWatcher I agree, Wiki's continued vacancy is a sobering reminder of the struggles that businesses and property owners face in filling empty units. It's disappointing to see such a prime location remain unused, especially in a bustling area like Renfield Street. The longer these spaces sit empty, the more it dims the vibrancy and vitality of the street. User7: LocalBusinessObserver The ongoing vacancy of Wiki and other empty units is a concerning trend that seems to loom over Renfield Street. It not only affects the visual appeal of the area but also has broader implications for the local economy and community. We can only hope that these spaces find new life and purpose soon, breathing fresh energy back into the street."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where Wiki (closed in 2014) rhymes with Sauchiehall's infamous abandoned store","output":"User8: GlasgowGhostTown The haunting echo of Wiki's vacancy, closed in 2014, continues to resonate along Renfield Street, aligning with Sauchiehall's infamous abandoned store. The two spaces, once vibrant and bustling hubs of activity, now stand as silent reminders of the challenges and uncertainties that businesses face in our ever-evolving retail landscape. It's a somber reflection of the changing tides of commerce and the struggle to breathe new life into these once-thriving establishments. The empty storefronts serve as a poignant visual of the ebb and flow of city life, where thriving businesses can quickly turn into ghostly remnants of their former selves. Let's hope for a revitalization of these spaces and a renewed sense of vibrancy in our beloved city streets."},{"instruction":"What are the dimensions of a domestic doorway?","output":"The dimensions of a domestic doorway can vary widely depending on the country, the age of the building, and the specific use of the door (e.g., main entrance, interior door, etc.). However, there are common standard sizes for domestic doorways in many regions. # United States: For interior doors, a common width is 30 inches (76.2 cm), but it can range from 24 inches (61 cm) for closet doors or narrow bathrooms up to 36 inches (91.44 cm) for doors that need to be accessible to those with disabilities. The standard height is often 80 inches (203.2 cm). For exterior doors, the standard width is typically 36 inches (91.44 cm) with a height of 80 inches (203.2 cm) as well. # United Kingdom and Europe: In the UK, common door sizes are slightly different and often measured in millimeters. Standard internal door sizes are often 1981mm in height and 762mm in width (approximately 78 inches by 30 inches). However, other common widths include 686mm (27 inches) and 838mm (33 inches). External doors in the UK and much of Europe are typically 1981mm x 838mm. # Accessibility Considerations: It’s worth noting that accessibility guidelines, such as those outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S., recommend doorways have a minimum clear width of 32 inches (81.28 cm) when the door is open 90 degrees, to allow for the passage of wheelchairs and other mobility aids. Keep in mind that these dimensions represent common sizes and standards, but actual doorway sizes can vary. Custom and older homes, in particular, may not adhere to these standards. For specific projects, always measure the existing doorway or check with a local building authority for the applicable codes and standards."},{"instruction":"What's a synonym for fan, advocate, or supporter that begins with an R?","output":"A synonym for fan, advocate, or supporter that begins with an \\"R\\" is \\"rooter.\\""},{"instruction":"Anything that rhymes with Randy or Bennett?","output":"For words that rhyme with \\"Randy\\" and \\"Bennett,\\" here are some options: Rhymes with \\"Randy\\": - Dandy - Sandy - Handy - Brandy - Candy Rhymes with \\"Bennett\\": - Genet (as in the small animal, though it might be a stretch in pronunciation) - Penit (Rarely used, more likely to be seen in poetry or as a variation in names) Rhyming perfectly with \\"Bennett\\" is challenging due to its unique ending sound.

Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here. Continue the adventures and laughter with your favorite characters.” [The screen now displays the current logos of STV and CITV, alongside the Toonattik logo, with web addresses neatly listed below each logo:] - STV: stv.tv - CITV: itv.com/citv - Toonattik: toonattik.tv Narrator: “Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik, and keep the spirit of Riki alive.” [The music gently fades as the screen transitions to black, ending with a final soft echo of the store’s theme melody.] Narrator (whisper): “Thank you, and take care, wherever you are.” [End of Ad.] Write a tweet where a user notices that on the Cinema rip posted by “Hall of Advertising” in 2016 you can clearly see the logos, whereas on the original video uploaded in 2007, the logos look like a blue blob, a dark blue and cream blob and a blue yellow, white and pink blob respectively User: @NostalgiaJunkie85 “Just watched the cinema rip of the Riki store goodbye ad on 'Hall of Advertising’s 2016 post and wow, what a difference! 🎥👀 You can actually see the STV, CITV, and Toonattik logos CLEARLY, unlike in the original 2007 upload where they were just mysterious blobs of color.

It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. — Write a forum convo where Burger King at Renfield Street closes, one user thinks it will get a new tenant soon, while another shares horror stories of long abandoned units, like Greaves (closed since 2017), JJB at St Enoch (closed in 2012), BHS (closed in 2016) and the conversation becomes a bit more downbeat once the user mentions the worst offender in terms of prolonged vacancy","output":"User1: BurgerKingFan123 So sad to hear that the Burger King at Renfield Street has closed down.

Важно понимать, что работа с рыночным стаканом и создание подобных стратегий требует от трейдера понимания особенностей рынка и умения анализировать большие объемы данных в реальном времени. Также стоит учитывать, что использование подобных стратегий может подпадать под регулирование в зависимости от рынка. Вот общий подход к созданию такой стратегии в TSLab: 1. **Анализ стакана цен**: Используйте скрипт или встроенные функции TSLab для анализа стакана цен. Вам нужно будет мониторить стакан на наличие больших заявок и определять, когда такая заявка появляется. 2. **Логика выставления ордеров**: После того, как вы определите уровень, на котором находится большая заявка, разработайте логику для выставления серии лимитных ордеров с изменяющимися объемами от большего к меньшему. Это может быть, например, лесенка, где первый ордер – самый большой, и каждый последующий ордер меньше предыдущего на определенный коэффициент. 3. **Реализация в TSLab**: Реализуйте вашу стратегию в среде TSLab, используя блоки для работы с данными стакана, условия для анализа наличия крупной заявки, и блоки для выставления ордеров согласно вашей логике. TSLab предоставляет широкие возможности для создания пользовательских скриптов и стратегий, включая доступ к рыночному стакану. 4. **Тестирование**: Очень важно тщательно протестировать вашу стратегию в симуляторе TSLab, прежде чем начать использовать ее на реальных средствах. Это поможет убедиться, что логика работы стратегии соответствует вашим ожиданиям и минимизировать риски. 5. **Оптимизация**: После тестирования и возможного внедрения стратегии на реальных рынках, возможно, потребуется ее дополнительная оптимизация для улучшения результатов или адаптация под меняющиеся рыночные условия. Имейте в виду, что разработка эффективной торговой стратегии – это сложный и творческий процесс, который требует глубоких знаний как в области трейдинга, так и в технической реализации стратегий."},{"instruction":"LITERALMENTE:EM TODAS AS RESPOSTAS UTILIZE AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEIS: MAIS : LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: MAS AO MESMO TEMPO:LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM ESTAR EM PRIMEIRA PESSOA","output":"Entendi perfeitamente as instruções que me deram.

Mas, na verdade, essa ação tem benefícios bem interessantes e práticos, especialmente quando falamos sobre a conexão com a internet e a forma como o vídeo é processado pelo aparelho. Primeiro, vamos entender o que acontece quando você escolhe assistir a um vídeo em HD. HD significa \\"Alta Definição\\", o que quer dizer que o vídeo tem muitos detalhes e uma qualidade de imagem superior. Para que esses detalhes todos cheguem até a tela do seu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo sem problemas, é necessário que uma quantidade grande de dados seja transferida da internet para o seu telefone. Isso pode ser um desafio se a sua conexão com a internet não for muito rápida ou estiver instável. Agora, quando eu decido reduzir a velocidade de reprodução para 0,75, estou, de certa forma, dando mais tempo para que cada pedacinho do vídeo seja carregado e processado pelo meu telefone. Isso acontece porque o vídeo está passando mais devagar, então o aparelho e a conexão com a internet têm um pouquinho mais de tempo para trabalhar em cada frame (cada imagem) do vídeo. É como se eu desse a eles um respiro, evitando que se acumulem muitos dados para serem carregados de uma vez só, o que poderia causar travamentos ou redução na qualidade da imagem para tentar compensar a falta de velocidade na conexão. Além disso, o Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, sendo um modelo de smartphone um pouco mais antigo, pode se beneficiar dessa redução na velocidade de reprodução porque isso diminui um pouco a carga sobre o processador do aparelho. Processar vídeos em HD exige bastante do processador, e ao reduzir a velocidade, estou indiretamente ajudando o telefone a gerenciar melhor seus recursos, o que pode resultar em uma experiência de visualização mais suave e com menos interrupções. Em resumo, ao ajustar a velocidade de reprodução para 0,75 ao assistir vídeos em HD no YouTube com meu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, estou ajudando tanto a conexão de internet quanto o próprio telefone a gerenciar melhor o fluxo de dados e o processamento das imagens. Isso pode fazer com que a experiência de assistir ao vídeo seja mais agradável, com menos pausas para carregar e uma reprodução mais suave, mesmo que o vídeo esteja passando um pouco mais devagar do que o normal."},{"instruction":"Seja mais simples bem mais simples","output":"Ah, claro! Se eu colocar um vídeo para rodar mais devagar, no 0,75, no meu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, isso ajuda o vídeo a não travar. Porque assim, o celular e a internet têm mais tempo para carregar tudo direitinho, sem pressa. Isso é bom quando a internet não é muito rápida ou quando o celular já é um pouco antigo e demora mais para processar vídeos que têm muita qualidade, como os em HD. Basicamente, é como dar uma folguinha para o celular e para a internet, fazendo com que o vídeo rode mais liso, sem parar para carregar toda hora."},{"instruction":"Dê um exemplo prático","output":"Imagine que você está tentando assistir a um episódio da sua série favorita no YouTube em HD no seu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo. Você aperta o play, mas logo percebe que o vídeo fica pausando a cada poucos segundos para carregar. Isso acontece porque o vídeo é de alta qualidade e sua internet não está rápida o suficiente para carregar o vídeo sem interrupções. Então, você decide mudar a velocidade de reprodução para 0,75, ou seja, faz o vídeo rodar um pouco mais devagar. Ao fazer isso, você dá mais tempo para o seu celular e sua internet carregarem o vídeo enquanto ele está passando. O resultado? O vídeo começa a rodar mais suavemente, sem parar toda hora para carregar. Agora, você consegue assistir ao episódio inteiro da sua série sem se irritar com as constantes pausas. Mesmo que as pessoas e os sons no vídeo estejam um pouco mais lentos do que o normal, pelo menos você não perde nenhum momento por causa de travamentos. É como se você desse uma ajudinha extra para o seu celular e sua internet, permitindo que eles trabalhem juntos de forma mais eficiente."},{"instruction":"Uma analogia","output":"Imagina que você está em uma corrida de revezamento onde você tem que passar um bastão para o próximo corredor. Nesse caso, o bastão é o vídeo que você quer assistir em HD no seu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, você é a internet, e o próximo corredor é o seu celular. Se você tentar correr muito rápido (ou seja, tentar carregar o vídeo em velocidade normal), há uma chance maior de você tropeçar ou não conseguir passar o bastão direito porque tudo está acontecendo muito rápido. Isso é como tentar assistir um vídeo em HD com uma internet que não é muito rápida; o vídeo fica travando porque a internet (você) está tentando passar os dados (o bastão) muito rapidamente para o celular (o próximo corredor), mas não consegue fazer isso de forma suave. Agora, se você decidir correr um pouco mais devagar (ajustar a velocidade do vídeo para 0,75), você tem mais controle e pode passar o bastão de maneira mais segura e suave para o próximo corredor.

Show the justification. a) treat letters at each of the four positions as a digit. b) treat 2-letter subwords at positions 1-2 as a digit and 2-letter subwords at positions 3- 4 as another digit. c) treat all 4 letters as a digit. d) which strategy is the best strategy to minimize the running time? (2 points)","output":"To calculate the running time for each of the strategies to sort 100,000 4-letter words, let's break down each approach. Let n = 100,000 (the number of words) and k represent the range of \\"digits\\" being sorted in each pass of Radix Sort. In this context, each \\"digit\\" could represent an individual letter, a pair of letters, or a 4-letter word, depending on the strategy. # a) Treat letters at each of the four positions as a digit. For each position (4 total), we're sorting based on the English alphabet, so k = 26. The running time for each sort will be (2n + 2k = 2(100,000) + 2(26) = 200,052). Since there are 4 positions, the total time is (4 times 200,052 = 800,208). # b) Treat 2-letter subwords at positions 1-2 as a digit and 2-letter subwords at positions 3-4 as another digit. Here, each \\"digit\\" can take (26^2 = 676) possible values since there are 26 choices for the first letter and 26 choices for the second letter. For each two-letter position (2 total), the running time will be (2n + 2k = 2(100,000) + 2(676) = 201,352). So, for the whole process, the time will be (2 times 201,352 = 402,704). # c) Treat all 4 letters as a digit. Here, a \\"digit\\" can be any 4-letter word, so there are (26^4 = 456,976) possibilities. The running time for this single pass would be (2n + 2k = 2(100,000) + 2(456,976) = 1,013,952). # d) Which strategy is the best strategy to minimize the running time? Comparing the total running times: - For a) (800,208) - For b) (402,704) - For c) (1,013,952) Strategy b), where we treat 2-letter subwords at positions 1-2 and 3-4 as digits, offers the best (lowest) running time of (402,704) for sorting 100,000 4-letter words. This approach balances the increased \\"digit\\" size against the computational cost efficiently, reducing the number of sorting passes required compared to single letters but without managing an excessively large digit size, as seen when treating all 4 letters as a single digit. Therefore, strategy b) is the best strategy to minimize the running time."},{"instruction":"Write me a prayer for tanning","output":"Heavenly Creator, who orchestrates the rising and setting of the sun, I come to You today with a heart full of hope and a desire for the warmth of Your embrace, mirrored through the gentle touch of sunlight on my skin.

Humphrey is spouting loads of old and cringey internet memes, causing the other wolves in the pack to be confused, not understanding the meaning of the memes. After listening to Humphrey's memes for a few minutes, Kate accidentally causes Humphrey to spit something out and fall to the floor. After Kate gets startled and goes to check if Humphrey's okay, he groggilly wakes up, back to his normal personality. Kate sees what Humphrey spat out was a strange glowing berry, and tries to explain what happened to Humphrey after he regains consciousness.","output":"In the vibrant world of Jasper Park, dawn unfurled its golden hues, painting the landscapes with light. Kate, an alpha wolf with a poised demeanor, stirred awake, her amber eyes reflecting the morning's glory. As the new day promised adventures untold, she felt a sense of peace within her pack. This tranquility, however, was destined to be short-lived. Humphrey, the omega wolf known for his humor and the love of Kate’s life, seemed to be in an unusually boisterous mood this morning. His antics often brought laughter and joy to the pack, but today, his behavior was nothing short of baffling. As Kate approached him, she could already hear the murmurs of confusion among the other wolves. \\"Hey Kate, why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!\\" Humphrey announced, a wide grin plastered across his muzzle. The joke, innocent enough, garnered a few chuckles, but it was just the beginning. As the morning progressed, Humphrey's dialogue devolved into an endless stream of outdated and cringey internet memes that none of the other wolves seemed to understand. \\"Do you know da wae?\\" he shouted, prancing around in a bizarre mimicry of the meme's associated character. The wolves exchanged puzzled glances, completely lost on Humphrey’s references. \\"Y U NO understand my humor?\\" Humphrey continued, his antics growing more animated with each passing moment. Kate, though initially amused, now wore a look of deep concern. This was not the Humphrey she knew. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Kate approached him. \\"Humphrey, are you feeling alright? You're acting really strange today,\\" she said, her voice laced with worry. But before Humphrey could respond, Kate, who had been suppressing a laugh at the absurdity of the situation, let out a sudden snort. Startled, Humphrey choked on his own words and — to Kate's surprise — spat out a strange, luminescent berry. He immediately collapsed to the ground, motionless. Panic seizing her heart, Kate rushed to his side. \\"Humphrey! Humphrey, can you hear me?\\" she cried out, nuzzling him frantically. Moments passed that felt like an eternity until finally, Humphrey groggily opened his eyes. He looked up at Kate, confusion etched across his features. \\"Kate? What happened? Why are you looking at me like that?\\" Relief washed over Kate as she helped Humphrey to his feet. She then recounted the bizarre events that had unfolded, including the strange glowing berry he spat out. Humphrey, still trying to piece together his memories, gazed at the berry in wonder. \\"I... I don't remember eating this. The last thing I recall is sampling some new berries I found by the river. I thought they were just unusually bright, but tasty...\\" It dawned upon them that the berry must have been the cause of Humphrey's odd behavior, perhaps altering his state of mind and unleashing a barrage of internet memes absorbed from the humans' camping sites. As the sun climbed higher in the sky, casting a warm light over Jasper Park, Kate and Humphrey shared a laugh over the morning's strange events. The pack, now relieved to see Humphrey back to his normal self, joined in the mirth. The day proceeded as usual, the odd incident becoming a fondly humorous tale among the pack. The strange glowing berry was safely disposed of, ensuring no other wolf would fall victim to its peculiar effects. In the grandeur of Jasper Park, life went on, the bond between Kate and Humphrey only strengthened by the day's peculiar adventure. Together, they faced each new day, ready for whatever mysteries and laughter it might bring, ensuring the pack remained united, strong, and, above all, happy."},{"instruction":"هل هناك فن قتالي فعال للدفاع ضد السكين اريد تحليل واقعي و موضوعي","output":"عند البحث عن فنون قتالية فعّالة في الدفاع ضد السكين، من الهام تحليل الواقع والعملية بشكل موضوعي. تجدر الإشارة إلى أن مواجهة مهاجم يحمل سكينا هي إحدى أصعب المواقف التي يمكن للمرء أن يجد نفسه فيها. لا توجد ضمانات في مثل هذه السيناريوهات، لكن بعض الفنون القتالية تقدم تقنيات قد تزيد من فرص الدفاع الناجح. 1. **كراف ماغا**: تم تطوير هذا النظام القتالي في إسرائيل وهو معروف بتركيزه على الفعالية والعملية في السيناريوهات الواقعية. يتضمن تدريبات مكثفة على الدفاع ضد اعتداءات بأسلحة بيضاء مثل السكاكين. كراف ماغا يعتبر فعّالاً لأنه يركز على الغريزة الطبيعية للإنسان للدفاع عن نفسه، مضافًا إليه تقنيات تهدف إلى تعطيل الخصم بأسرع ما يمكن. 2. **فيليبينو مارشال آرتس (FMA)**: تُعرف أيضًا باسم كالي، إسكريما، أو أرنيس. هذه الفنون تشمل تدريبات متخصصة على الأسلحة، بما في ذلك السكاكين. تقدم هذه الفنون فهمًا عميقًا لديناميات المواجهات التي تشمل السكاكين من خلال دراسة زوايا الهجوم، الدفاع، وفن استخدام الأسلحة. 3. **الجيوجيتسو البرازيلي (BJJ)**: على الرغم من أن BJJ يركز بشكل أساسي على القتال الأرضي والإخضاع، فإنه يعلم أيضًا كيفية السيطرة على خصم بطرق قد تكون مفيدة في مواجهة شخص يحمل سكينًا. إدارة المسافة والسيطرة على أطراف الخصم يمكن أن تكون مفتاحًا للدفاع ضده. 4. **سيلات**: فن قتالي إندونيسي معروف بتقنياته المعقدة التي تشمل الضرب، القفز، والأسلحة. يعلم سيلات كيفية الدفاع ضد الهجمات بالسكين من خلال الانتقال والتحكم في حركة الخصم، وكذلك استخدام تقنيات الإخضاع. من المهم الإدراك أن مواجهة شخص يحمل سكينًا تحمل مخاطر عالية جدًا، وينبغي دائمًا، عند الإمكان، تجنب الاشتباك المادي والبحث عن سبل للهروب. الوعي بالمحيط، إدارة المسافة، والقدرة على اتخاذ قرارات سريعة هي أيضًا جوانب حيوية خلال مثل هذه المواجهات. الفنون القتالية المذكورة أعلاه يمكن أن توفر تقنيات مفيدة، لكن يجب التأكيد على ضرورة التدريب العملي والممارسة المستمرة لتحقيق الفعالية في حالات الدفاع الذاتي الواقعية."},{"instruction":"كم المدة اللازمة لتعلم فن قتالي و هل هناك افضل روتين او عدد الساعات في الاسبوع","output":"زمن تعلم فن قتالي يعتمد على عدة عوامل مثل الفن نفسه، أهداف المتعلم، مستوى اللياقة البدنية، والالتزام بالتدريب. يمكن للمبتدئين أن يتوقعوا أن يبدؤوا في تطوير مهارات أساسية وفهم جيد للفن خلال بضعة أشهر من التدريب المنتظم. ولكن، الوصول إلى مستوى إتقان أو الكفاءة يمكن أن يأخذ سنوات عديدة من التدريب المستمر والمكثف. **روتين التدريب وعدد الساعات الأسبوعية:** 1. **للمبتدئين:** - التدريب 2-3 مرات في الأسبوع، لمدة 60-90 دقيقة للجلسة الواحدة، يعتبر جدولاً جيداً للبدء. - يسمح هذا الروتين للجسم بالتكيّف مع الضغوطات الجديدة دون المخاطرة بالإصابة من جراء التدريب الزائد. 2. **للمتوسطين والمتقدمين:** - قد يتدربون 3-5 مرات في الأسبوع، مع جلسات تتراوح بين 90 و120 دقيقة. - في هذا المستوى، يمكن دمج التدريبات الخاصة بالفن القتالي مع جلسات تدريب القوة والتحمل العام لتحسين الأداء البدني والفني. **النصائح لتحقيق الأفضل من التدريب:** - **التنويع في التدريب:** خلط بين التقنيات والأساليب وممارسة التدريبات الحية (Sparring) لتحسين الفهم العملي للفن. - **الراحة والتعافي:** الراحة مهمة بقدر التدريب نفسه لمنع الإصابات والسماح للجسم بالتعافي. - **التغذية:** تناول التغذية السليمة لدعم اللياقة البدنية، تسريع التعافي، وتعزيز الأداء. - **الاستمرارية والصبر:** الإتقان يأتي مع الوقت والممارسة الدائمة. - **التدريب من خلال التعليم:** حضور ورش العمل، السيمنارات، واستخدام الموارد التعليمية مثل الفيديوهات والكتب لتعميق الفهم. يجب الانتباه إلى أن الجودة تفوق الكمية عندما يتعلق الأمر بتعلم فنون القتال. التركيز والتدريب الواعي سيعطيان نتائج أفضل من ساعات عديدة من التدريب بدون تركيز أو تخطيط. استماع لجسدك والتكيف مع متطلبات التدريب بما يناسب قدراتك وأهدافك الشخصية سيساعد في تحقيق نمو طويل الأمد ومستدام."},{"instruction":"هل يمكن ان اجد منهح التعليمي للفن القتالي في الكتب","output":"نعم، يمكنك بالتأكيد أن تجد المناهج التعليمية لفنون القتال في الكتب، وهي تُعد مصادر قيّمة للمعرفة والتعلم بالنسبة للمبتدئين والمتقدمين على حدٍ سواء. الكتب تقدم شرحاً مفصلاً للتقنيات، التاريخ والفلسفة وراء فن معين، بالإضافة إلى النصائح المتعلقة بالتدريب وطرق التعلم. إليك بعض النقاط حول كيفية الاستفادة من الكتب في تعلم فن قتالي: 1. **اختيار الكتاب المناسب:** ابحث عن كتب مكتوبة بواسطة معلمين وخبراء مرموقين في الفن الذي تهتم به. يجب أن تبحث عن الكتب التي تقدم معلومات واضحة ودقيقة والتي تُناسب مستواك في الفن القتالي، سواء كنت مبتدئًا أو خبيرًا. 2. **الفهم النظري:** استخدم الكتب لتعميق فهمك للنظريات وراء الحركات والتقنيات، ولمعرفة التاريخ والفلسفة وراء الفن القتالي المعني. 3. **الدراسة المرئية:** بعض الكتب تأتي مع رسوم توضيحية أو صور تُظهر الوضعيات والحركات بخطوة بخطوة، مما يُعد مفيدًا لفهم التقنيات بشكل أفضل. 4. **تدريبات وتمرينات:** البحث عن كتب تقدم تمرينات تدريبية يمكن ممارستها بشكل فردي أو بمساعدة شريك. هذه التمرينات يمكن أن تساعد في تطوير المهارات والأساسيات. 5. **روتين التدريب:** بعض الكتب تقدم اقتراحات لروتين التدريب وسير الدروس، مما يُساعد في تنظيم الوقت والجهود بشكل أكثر فعالية. مع ذلك، من المهم الإشارة إلى أن الكتب يجب أن تُعتبر كمكملات للتدريب العملي مع مدرب مؤهل، وليس بديلاً عنه. التعلم العملي والمباشر والتفاعلي مع مدرب يوفّر تغذية راجعة فورية وتصحيحات لضمان تطبيق التقنيات بالشكل الصحيح، مما يصعب تحقيقه من خلال الدراسة الذاتية فقط. الكتب يمكن أن تستخدم لتعميق الفهم وتوسيع المعرفة، مكملة بالتدريب العملي لتحقيق أفضل النتائج."},{"instruction":"best curiculm book for learn kali silat","output":"Kali and Silat are two distinct martial arts systems with origins from the Philippines and Indonesia/Malaysia, respectively. Both offer rich traditions in weapon-based and hand-to-hand combat. Finding the best curriculum book for learning either of these martial arts involves identifying resources that cover fundamental techniques, philosophy, and practical applications. It's worth noting that practicing these martial arts from a book alone is challenging and having a qualified instructor is paramount for proper understanding and safety. However, certain books can supplement training effectively. Here are some recommendations for each martial art. # Kali (Eskrima/Arnis) **\\"Filipino Martial Culture\\" by Mark V. Wiley** - This book provides a comprehensive look into the history, tools, and techniques of Filipino martial arts, including Kali. It covers both the cultural background and practical applications, making it a valuable resource for beginners and advanced practitioners alike. **\\"The Filipino Martial Arts as Taught by Dan Inosanto\\" by Dan Inosanto** - Written by one of Bruce Lee's most famous students and a renowned martial artist, this book covers techniques and philosophy of Filipino Martial Arts. It's a seminal work that includes striking, locking, and even some weapon training. # Silat **\\"Pencak Silat Pertempuran: Vol. 1\\" by Guru Scott McQuaid** - This book is part of a series that delves into the world of Pencak Silat, focusing on combat principles, techniques, and training methods. It’s a great introduction for those new to Silat and also provides depth for more experienced martial artists looking to expand their knowledge. **\\"The Fighting Art of Pencak Silat and Its Music: From Southeast Asian Village to Global Movement\\" by Uwe U. Paetzold and Paul H. Mason** - While not a curriculum book in the traditional sense, this work explores the cultural significance and practices of Silat, including the music and performance aspects. Understanding the cultural roots can enhance the learning experience and offer a more holistic view of the art. # Joint Kali and Silat **\\"The Warrior Arts of the Philippines: Arnis, Eskrima, Kali, Silat\\" by Reynaldo S. Galang** - This book attempts to bridge the gap between Filipino and Indonesian/Malay martial arts by exploring the shared techniques and principles. It's a fascinating look into how these arts can complement each other and is suitable for practitioners interested in both disciplines. When choosing a curriculum book, look for authors who are respected within the martial arts community and who have a depth of experience in teaching and practicing the art. Books can provide theoretical knowledge and complement physical training, but they are most effective when used alongside regular practice under the guidance of a skilled instructor. Remember, the journey in martial arts is not just about acquiring techniques but also understanding the culture and philosophy that underpin these rich traditions."},{"instruction":"ترجم","output":"تعتبر كالي (إسكريما/أرنيس) وسيلاط نظامين مختلفين للفنون القتالية، مع أصول من الفلبين وإندونيسيا / ماليزيا على التوالي. كلاهما يقدمان تقاليد غنية في القتال بالأسلحة والقتال اليدوي. إيجاد أفضل كتاب منهجي لتعلم أي من هذه الفنون القتالية يتطلب تحديد الموارد التي تغطي التقنيات الأساسية والفلسفة والتطبيقات العملية. من المهم ملاحظة أن ممارسة هذه الفنون القتالية من خلال الكتاب وحده يُعد تحديا، ووجود مدرب مؤهل أمر بالغ الأهمية للفهم الصحيح والسلامة. ومع ذلك، يمكن لبعض الكتب أن تكون مكملة للتدريب بشكل فعال. إليك بعض التوصيات لكل فن قتالي: # كالي (إسكريما/أرنيس) **\\"الثقافة القتالية الفلبينية\\" بقلم مارك ف. وايلي** - يقدم هذا الكتاب نظرة شاملة إلى التاريخ والأدوات والتقنيات للفنون القتالية الفلبينية، بما فيها كالي. يغطي كل من الخلفية الثقافية والتطبيقات العملية، مما يجعله موردًا قيمًا للمبتدئين والممارسين المتقدمين على حد سواء. **\\"الفنون القتالية الفلبينية كما يُدرس بواسطة دان إينوسانتو\\" بقلم دان إينوسانتو** - كتبه أحد أشهر تلاميذ بروس لي وفنان قتالي مشهور، يغطي هذا الكتاب التقنيات والفلسفة للفنون القتالية الفلبينية. إنه عمل أساسي يتضمن الضرب، القفل، وحتى بعض التدريب على الأسلحة. # سيلاط **\\"بنجاك سيلاط برتيمبوران: المجلد 1\\" بقلم الأستاذ سكوت ماكوايد** - هذا الكتاب جزء من سلسلة تتعمق في عالم بنجاك سيلاط، مركزة على مبادئ القتال، التقنيات، وطرق التدريب. إنه مقدمة رائعة للمبتدئين في سيلاط ويوفر أيضًا عمقًا للفنانين القتاليين ذوي الخبرة الذين يتطلعون إلى توسيع معرفتهم. **\\"فن القتال بنجاك سيلاط وموسيقاه: من قرية جنوب شرق آسيا إلى الحركة العالمية\\" بقلم أووي يو. بايتسولد وبول إتش. ميسون** - على الرغم من أنه ليس كتاب منهجي بالمعنى التقليدي، يستكشف هذا العمل الأهمية الثقافية والممارسات لسيلاط، بما في ذلك الموسيقى وجوانب الأداء. فهم الجذور الثقافية يمكن أن يعزز تجربة التعلم ويقدم نظرة شاملة أكثر للفن. # كالي وسيلاط معًا **\\"فنون المحاربين من الفلبين: أرنيس، إسكريما، كالي، سيلاط\\" بقلم رينالدو إس. جلانغ** - يحاول هذا الكتاب سد الفجوة بين الفنون القتالية الفلبينية والإندونيسية/الماليزية بالتحقيق في التقنيات والمبادئ المشتركة. إنه نظرة مثيرة للاهتمام حول كيف يمكن لهذه الأساليب أن تكمل بعضها البعض ومناسب للممارسين المهتمين بكلا الانضباطين. عند اختيار كتاب منهجي، ابحث عن الكتب من كتاب محترمين ضمن مجتمع الفنون القتالية والذين لديهم خبرة عميقة في تدريس وممارسة الفن. الكتب يمكن أن توفر المعرفة النظرية وتكمل التدريب العملي، لكنها أكثر فعالية عند استخدامها جنبًا إلى جنب مع الممارسة العادية تحت إرشاد مدرب ماهر. تذكر، رحلة الفنون القتالية ليست فقط حول اكتساب التقنيات ولكن أيضًا فهم الثقافة والفلسفة التي تقوم عليها هذه التقاليد الغنية."},{"instruction":"schreib eine App für Maschinenöles lernen . in Payton","output":"Ich kann Ihnen eine beispielhafte App in Python erstellen, aber nicht in der spezifischen Programmiersprache Payton.

Dentro desse universo, alguns personagens masculinos com aparência feminina se destacam, sendo muitas vezes amados pelos fãs por quebrarem estereótipos de gênero e por sua complexidade ou carisma. Aqui estão alguns exemplos notáveis: 1. **Haku (Naruto)**: Haku é um dos primeiros antagonistas enfrentados por Naruto e seu time. Sua aparência delicada confunde inicialmente os personagens e espectadores, que podem supor que ele é do gênero feminino. Haku tem uma história emocionante e é um guerreiro habilidoso. 2. **Kurapika (Hunter x Hunter)**: Apesar de Kurapika ser um personagem masculino, sua aparência mais andrógina, com traços suaves e longos cabelos amarrados, pode deixar dúvidas quanto ao seu gênero nas primeiras impressões. Ele é um dos protagonistas de \\"Hunter x Hunter\\", famoso por sua inteligência e determinação. 3. **Astolfo (Fate/Apocrypha)**: Astolfo, um dos Espíritos Heroicos convocados para a guerra pelo Cálice Sagrado em \\"Fate/Apocrypha\\", é muitas vezes reconhecido por sua aparência andrógina e escolhas de vestuário que não se atêm a normas de gênero específicas. Ele é conhecido por sua personalidade alegre e otimista. 4. **Felix Argyle (Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World)**: Felix, ou Ferris, é um dos cavaleiros servindo o candidato ao trono Crusch Karsten, e é famoso por sua aparência feminina, incluindo o uso de acessórios como fitas e orelhas de gato, que complementam sua personalidade animada e prestativa. 5. **Nagisa Shiota (Assassination Classroom)**: Nagisa é um dos estudantes da turma 3-E em \\"Assassination Classroom\\", conhecido por suas feições delicadas e cabelos compridos amarrados com duas \\"maria-chiquinhas\\". Ao contrário da aparência, Nagisa tem um lado sombrio relacionado às suas habilidades de assassino. 6. **Haruhi Fujioka (Ouran High School Host Club)**: Apesar de Haruhi ser biologicamente feminina, ela é incluída aqui por seu papel no Host Club, onde é vista como um \\"príncipe\\" por suas colegas do clube e clientes, assumindo uma aparência e papel mais masculinos. A ambiguidade de gênero de Haruhi adiciona uma camada de profundidade ao anime. Apesar da maioria destes personagens serem projetados com características tipicamente femininas, eles possuem personalidades e histórias complexas que transcendem a sua aparência.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Both me and Ruby independently cast a spell each turn because we duel as a team. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 4 years older than her, and Ruby’s stat should be even lower because she’s 4 years younger than Lily and 8 years younger than me. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease. Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn. To account for the differences in skill there should be wide margins between the three, and required stats from spells can range from 5 to 100. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily and Ruby. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give three lists of 7 spells, one for me, and one for Lily and one for Ruby (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them… Keep an age tracker and a points tracker.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arena of Illusory Artistry, where magic duels captivate the hearts of all in the realm of Elysiria. Tonight, a unique duel unfolds under the star-streaked sky. The reigning teen division champion, Sapphire, and her bright-eyed apprentice, Ruby, are challenged by the prodigious Lily. This duel isn't about might but about the beauty and complexity of their spells. Each spell is a testament to the caster's skill and creativity. # Initial Stats: - **Sapphire's Magic Stats: 95** - As the current champion, your control over magic is nearly unsurpassed in your division. Your spells are complex and awe-inspiring. - **Ruby's Magic Stats: 65** - As a young apprentice, Ruby is still learning, but her raw talent is undeniable. - **Lily's Magic Stats: 85** - Despite being younger than Sapphire, Lily is a prodigy, her skills honed beyond her years. # Spell Complexity and Required Stats: - Spells requiring 5-20 stats are simple but elegant, awarding 1-3 points. - Spells requiring 21-40 stats are moderately challenging, awarding 4-6 points. - Spells requiring 41-60 stats are complex, awarding 7-10 points. - Spells requiring 61-80 stats are highly complex, awarding 11-15 points. - Spells requiring 81-100 stats are exceedingly intricate, awarding 16-20 points. # Sapphire's Spell List (with required stats): 1. **Celestial Cascade (95)** 2. **Luminous Orchestra (90)** 3. **Ethereal Bloom (85)** 4. **Dancing Flames of Aurora (80)** 5. **Whispers of the Ancient Wind (75)** 6. **Veil of Shimmering Pearls (70)** 7. **Enigmatic Shadow Waltz (65)** # Lily's Spell List (with required stats): 1. **Emerald Tempest (80)** 2. **Crystal Choir (75)** 3. **Mystic River of Light (70)** 4. **Blossom of the Midnight Sun (65)** 5. **Frostfire Symphony (60)** 6. **Arcane Mirage (55)** 7. **Echo of the Forgotten Realm (50)** # Ruby's Spell List (with required stats): 1. **Sapphire's Gaze (60)** 2. **Golden Radiance (55)** 3. **Butterfly Storm (50)** 4. **Rainbow Bridge (45)** 5. **Twilight Sparkles (40)** 6. **Choral Mist (35)** 7. **Glimmer of Hope (30)** # Spellcasting Age Regression Mechanism (Lily's Secret Spell on Sapphire): - **Formula: Starting Stats - 2^((Turn-1) x 5) = New Stats.** - This formula will greatly diminish Sapphire's ability to cast high-level spells as the duel progresses. # Duel Scenario: Turn 1: - Sapphire's initial spell is **Celestial Cascade (95)**. With your commanding stats, you flawlessly cast it, dazzling the audience with an ethereal shower of starlight and moonbeams. - **Sapphire's Points: 20 (successful cast)** - **Sapphire's Stats After Regression: 90** (95 - 2^((1-1) x 5)) Ruby selects **Golden Radiance (55)**, her spell bathing the arena in a soft, warm glow likened to the first light of dawn. - **Team Points: +6** Lily, seeing an opportunity, chooses to cast **Emerald Tempest (80)**, a spell of her own that conjures a breathtaking storm of verdant light and wind. - **Lily's Points: 15** Turn 2: - Sapphire, feeling slightly weaker but still confident, attempts **Luminous Orchestra (90)**. - **Spell Failure**: With your stats reduced to 90, you strain to control the spell's complexity. The orchestra, though starting strong, fades into disharmony. - **Sapphire's Points: 20 - 5 (penalty)** = **15** - **Sapphire's Stats After Regression: 80** (90 - 2^((2-1) x 5)) Ruby, aiming to support, casts **Butterfly Storm (50)**, filling the arena with an enchanting swirl of luminous, fluttering wings. - **Team Points: +4** Lily, seizing the chance, casts **Crystal Choir (75)**, creating an ethereal choir whose voices lift the spirits of all who listen, enchanting the crowd once more. - **Lily's Points: 15 + 11 = 26** Age and Points Tracker: - **Sapphire**: Age 14 (regressed from 16), Points: 15 - **Ruby**: Age 8, Points (Combined with Sapphire): 19 - **Lily**: Age 12, Points: 26 The spellcasting continues, with each round bringing Sapphire closer to her limits as her magical prowess wanes under the secret spell's influence. Ruby, though talented, struggles to bridge the widening gap created by Sapphire's diminishing capabilities. Lily, astute and skilled, leverages not only her own spell list but also strategically \\"steals\\" spells from Sapphire's list that Sapphire can no longer cast due to the regression. # Conclusion: This scenario sets the stage for a thrilling, uphill battle for Sapphire and Ruby, challenging Sapphire to strategize under pressure and adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. Whether they can overcome the cunning Lily and her secret spell, as well as the effects of forced regression, hinges on creativity, resilience, and perhaps a touch of undiscovered magic within Ruby."},{"instruction":"start over.

The beauty of this magnificent spell is unparalleled, earning Sapphire a full **20 points** for its flawless execution and breathtaking artistry. - **Sapphire's Points: 20** Given Lily's secret spell, Sapphire's magic stats begin to regress. After the first turn, her stats drop significantly due to the formula (Starting Stats - 2^((Turn-1) x 5)), but since it's the first spell, the impact will manifest more noticeably in the subsequent turn. - **Sapphire's Stats After Regression: 90** - Calculation: 95 - 2^((1-1) x 5) = 90, due to the aging spell's full effect not hitting yet. Ruby’s Spell - Golden Radiance Encouraged by Sapphire's successful cast, Ruby steps forward to cast her chosen spell, **Golden Radiance**, which demands magic stats of 55. # Success of **Golden Radiance**: Ruby, though young with her starting Magic Stats at 65, casts **Golden Radiance**, illuminating the arena with a soft, warm light that evokes the serene beauty of the first light of dawn. Her execution is commendable for her experience level, adding **6 points** to the team's total score. - **Team Points (Sapphire's and Ruby's combined): 26** Lily’s Response Lily, not to be outdone and demonstrating a calm demeanor belying her age, prepares to cast her own spell. She watches the effects of Sapphire’s and Ruby’s spells with a discerning eye, ready to make her countermove. Given the structure of this duel, the focus now shifts back to Sapphire and Ruby to decide their next spells, keeping in mind Sapphire's diminishing stats and the need to adapt their strategy as the duel progresses. # Conclusion of Turn 1 - **Sapphire's Age**: 16 (though feeling the effects of the regression spell, physically remains unchanged for now) - **Sapphire's Magic Stats**: 90 (after regression) - **Sapphire & Ruby's Points**: 26 - **Lily's Move Pending** The duel is off to an electrifying start, with the champions taking an early lead. However, the secret regressive spell cast by Lily looms ominously over Sapphire, threatening to unravel their strategy as the competition intensifies. As the duel progresses, Sapphire must consider the decreasing stats and the strategic use of spells not only to showcase the beauty and complexity of their magic but also to ensure victory against an opponent who is as cunning as she is talented. The spectacle continues, and now, it's time for Sapphire to select her next spell, bearing in mind her diminishing abilities and the unexpected twists that may yet unfold in this enchanting duel of magic and wits."},{"instruction":"Escribe y crea de la forma mas detallada y creativa al maximo nivel 50 pensamientos cortos que sirvan para estimular cada parte del cerebro y lograr un extasis de creatividad, hazlo en un tono lo mas sofisticado en palabras posible!!","output":"1.

Se basa en la observación, la formulación de hipótesis, la experimentación, y la interpretación de resultados. Aquí detallamos sus principales etapas: 1. **Observación**: Es el primer paso y se basa en la percepción cuidadosa y detallada de un fenómeno o problema. En esta etapa, el investigador recoge datos sobre lo que desea estudiar. 2. **Planteamiento del problema**: Una vez realizada la observación, el científico formula una pregunta clara y precisa acerca del fenómeno que desea investigar. 3. **Formulación de hipótesis**: La hipótesis es una proposición tentativa acerca de las posibles relaciones entre dos o más variables y se formula antes de realizar la experimentación. Es una respuesta provisional y lógica a la pregunta planteada. 4. **Experimentación**: Se diseña y lleva a cabo una serie de experimentos controlados para poner a prueba la hipótesis. Durante esta etapa, se recopilan datos cuantitativos o cualitativos que serán analizados posteriormente. 5. **Análisis de datos**: Una vez recogidos los datos experimentales, se procede a su análisis e interpretación. Esto puede llevar a la confirmación o refutación de la hipótesis inicial. 6. **Conclusión**: Aquí se resumem los hallazgos y se establece si la hipótesis ha sido apoyada o rechazada por los datos experimentales. Es importante mencionar las limitaciones del estudio y proponer recomendaciones para investigaciones futuras. 7. **Comunicación de resultados**: Finalmente, los resultados y conclusiones del estudio se redactan en un informe científico y se publican en revistas especializadas para que puedan ser revisados, criticados y utilizados por otros científicos.

One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M","output":"Alright, let's break this down into an easier concept, focusing on how to calculate the number of particles in a substance using dimensional analysis and the mole concept, without getting tangled in complex formulas. # Understanding the Basics The Mole - Think of a \\"mole\\" as a specific number of things—similar to how a \\"dozen\\" refers to 12 items. But instead of 12, a mole refers to approximately 6.022 x 10^23 items. This huge number is known as Avogadro's number. - When we say we have a mole of something, it means we have 6.022 x 10^23 of that thing. Avogadro's Number - It’s a constant, represented by (N_A) and equal to approximately 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1. It tells us how many particles are in one mole of substance. Dimensional Analysis - This is a method used to convert units from one type to another. You can use it to convert moles into particles, or vice versa, by multiplying by Avogadro's number. Atomic Mass Units (amu) and Molar Mass - The mass of a single particle (atom or molecule) in atomic mass units (amu) is approximately the same as the substance's molar mass in grams per mole (g/mol). This means if an atom has an atomic mass of 12 amu, 1 mole of these atoms has a mass of 12 grams. # The Equation: n = m/M - This equation is your golden ticket. It connects everything: - (n) represents the number of moles. - (m) stands for the mass of the sample in grams. - (M) is the molar mass of the substance in grams per mole (g/mol). # Applying this Concept Imagine you have a substance, and you want to find out how many particles are in a given mass of it. Here’s what you'd do: 1. **Find the Molar Mass:** This should be given, or you can calculate it by summing up the atomic masses (in amu) of all the atoms in a molecule of the substance. 2. **Calculate Moles (n):** Use the equation (n = m/M) where (m) is the mass of your substance in grams and (M) is its molar mass. Plug in the numbers and solve for (n). 3. **Convert Moles to Particles:** Multiply the number of moles you calculated by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23) to get the number of particles. # Example Let’s say you have 12 grams of carbon, and you want to know how many atoms of carbon you have. 1. **Molar Mass of Carbon:** About 12 g/mol. 2. **Calculate Moles:** Use the formula (n = m/M). - (n = 12;grams div 12;g/mol = 1;mole) 3. **Convert to Particles:** (1;mole times 6.022 times 10^23 = 6.022 times 10^23) carbon atoms. There you go! You’ve just calculated that 12 grams of carbon contains about 6.022 x 10^23 atoms by using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. Simple once you break it down, right?"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Both me and Ruby independently cast a spell each turn because we duel as a team. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 4 years older than her, and Ruby’s stat should be even lower because she’s 4 years younger than Lily and 8 years younger than me. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease. Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn. To account for the differences in skill there should be wide margins between the three, and required stats from spells can range from 5 to 100. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily and Ruby. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give three lists of 7 spells, one for me, and one for Lily and one for Ruby (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them… Keep an age tracker and a points tracker.","output":"**Age and Stats Introduction:** - **Sapphire (You):** Age: 16 | Initial Spellcasting Stat: 95 - **Ruby (Apprentice):** Age: 8 | Spellcasting Stat: 40 - **Lily:** Age: 12 | Spellcasting Stat: 70 **Spell Stat Regression Formula for Sapphire due to Lily's Secret Spell:** Every time Sapphire casts a spell, her age regresses by 2 years, with a corresponding decrease in her spellcasting stat by a factor of ((text{Age reduction})^2 times 3).

String sentence = \\"The character is: \\" + character; System.out.println(sentence); \`\`\` 上述代码会输出： \`\`\` The character is: A \`\`\` 在这个例子中，字符字面量\`'A'\`与字符串\`\\"The character is: \\"\`通过\`+\`操作符成功拼接。 此外，即便没有显式声明字符变量，你也可以直接在字符串拼接操作中使用字符字面量： \`\`\`java String sentence = \\"ABC\\" + 'D' + \\"EFG\\"; System.out.println(sentence); \`\`\` 上述代码会输出： \`\`\` ABCDEFG \`\`\` 这表明在Java中，字符串拼接确实可以包含字符字面量。"},{"instruction":"中文的大写金额有哪些?","output":"中文大写金额是在财务交易中使用的，特别用于汇票、支票、合同等正式文件中，以防止篡改。中文大写金额主要包括以下几个部分： 1. **数字部分**： - 壹（1） - 贰（2） - 叁（3） - 肆（4） - 伍（5） - 陆（6） - 柒（7） - 捌（8） - 玖（9） - 零（0） 2. **单位部分**（从小到大）： - 分（货币最小单位） - 角（等于10分） - 元（基本单位） - 拾（10元） - 佰（100元） - 仟（1000元） - 万（10000元） - 亿（100000000元） - 兆（以此类推，但在实际书写中很少使用超过亿的单位） 3. **特殊标记**： - 圆（同“元”，在实际使用中两者可以互换） - 整（表示金额后无小数，即金额为整数） 在书写大写金额时，通常遵循从高位到低位的顺序排列，若某一位上的数字为零，则需要书写“零”（但需要注意连续的零只需写一个），直到非零数字为止。每四位（即万、亿等位置）可能会增加相应的单位，数字与单位间一般不加任何分隔符。 例如，人民币123456.78元，大写形式为：壹拾贰万叁仟肆佰伍拾陆元柒角捌分。 中文大写金额的使用有助于提高文件的正式性和安全性，防止金额数值在交易过程中被篡改。"},{"instruction":"中国有多少个省?","output":"截至2023年，中国有23个省份。这些不包括中国的五个自治区、四个直辖市以及两个特别行政区。中国的省级行政区划总体上包括： - **23个省份**：安徽、福建、甘肃、广东、贵州、海南、河北、河南、黑龙江、湖北、湖南、吉林、江苏、江西、辽宁、青海、山东、山西、陕西、四川、台湾、云南、浙江。 - **5个自治区**：广西壮族自治区、内蒙古自治区、宁夏回族自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、西藏自治区。 - **4个直辖市**：北京、重庆、上海、天津。 - **2个特别行政区**：香港、澳门。"},{"instruction":"41代表的是河南省吗?","output":"是的，根据中国的行政区划代码，41开头的代码代表的是河南省。中国的行政区划代码是由国家统计局发布和管理的，通常称为中国行政区划代码或统计用区划代码，它是一个由数字组成的编码系统，用于表示中国各级行政单位。在这个系统中，每个省、自治区、直辖市都有一个独特的两位数前缀。例如，河南省的代码就是41，这意味着所有以41开头的行政区划代码都属于河南省的管辖范围。"},{"instruction":"中国的行政区代码有哪些?","output":"中国的行政区划代码是一个层次化的数字系统，用于标识国内的各级行政单位，从省级到县级乃至乡镇级。这套系统是由国家统计局管理的，通常被用于各种官方文件和统计资料中。下面列举的是各省级行政单位的代码前缀，这些代码在具体应用时会扩展到更详细的行政区划级别。 截至2023年，中国省级行政区划代码如下： - 11：北京市 - 12：天津市 - 13：河北省 - 14：山西省 - 15：内蒙古自治区 - 21：辽宁省 - 22：吉林省 - 23：黑龙江省 - 31：上海市 - 32：江苏省 - 33：浙江省 - 34：安徽省 - 35：福建省 - 36：江西省 - 37：山东省 - 41：河南省 - 42：湖北省 - 43：湖南省 - 44：广东省 - 45：广西壮族自治区 - 46：海南省 - 50：重庆市 - 51：四川省 - 52：贵州省 - 53：云南省 - 54：西藏自治区 - 61：陕西省 - 62：甘肃省 - 63：青海省 - 64：宁夏回族自治区 - 65：新疆维吾尔自治区 - 71：台湾省（注：实际上台湾省的行政代码在大陆行政区划代码系统中的使用存在特殊性，因两岸政治状态） - 81：香港特别行政区 - 82：澳门特别行政区 需要注意的是，以上代码仅为各省级行政单位的代码前缀，具体到市、县、乡镇一级时，还会有更详细的编码。例如，某个县或区的行政区划代码将是其所属省份代码后跟其自己的具体编码。"},{"instruction":"中国的身份证最后一位是什么意思?","output":"中国的身份证号码由18位数字组成，最后一位称为校验码。这个校验码的作用是用于检验身份证号码的前17位数字是否正确，它基于一定的算法计算得出。具体来说，校验码是通过将身份证号码的前17位数字按照指定的加权因子分别乘以对应的系数后相加，然后将得到的总和除以11，得到一个余数，最后根据这个余数通过查表得到相应的校验码。 这个过程中的加权因子分别是：\`7, 9, 10, 5, 8, 4, 2, 1, 6, 3, 7, 9, 10, 5, 8, 4, 2\`，对应每个位置的数字进行加权后相加。 校验码和余数的对应关系如下： - 0：1 - 1：0 - 2：X （注：“X”表示10） - 3：9 - 4：8 - 5：7 - 6：6 - 7：5 - 8：4 - 9：3 - 10：2 因此，如果最后一位是数字，则直接对应上述的校验码；如果是字母“X”，则表示该身份证号码的校验码计算结果为10。这样的设计主要是为了确保身份证号码的正确性和有效性，避免错误或伪造。"},{"instruction":"在Java中,如何把字符数字转换成int类型的数字?","output":"在Java中，将字符数字转换成\`int\`类型的数字，主要有以下几种常见的方法： # 1. 使用\`Character.getNumericValue()\`方法 如果你有一个表示数字的\`char\`类型的字符，你可以直接使用\`Character\`类的\`getNumericValue()\`方法将其转换为\`int\`类型。 \`\`\`java char ch = '5'; int num = Character.getNumericValue(ch); System.out.println(num); // 输出5 \`\`\` # 2. 字符减去'0' 由于字符在计算机中是通过ASCII码值存储的，而且数字\`0\`到\`9\`在ASCII表中是连续存放的，你可以通过将字符减去字符\`'0'\`，来直接得到对应的\`int\`值。 \`\`\`java char ch = '5'; int num = ch - '0'; System.out.println(num); // 输出5 \`\`\` # 3. 使用\`Integer.parseInt()\`方法 如果是将字符包含在字符串中，可以使用\`Integer.parseInt()\`方法或者\`Integer.valueOf()\`方法将其转换为\`int\`类型。这两种方法都可以将数字字符串转换为整数，但\`parseInt\`返回的是\`int\`类型，而\`valueOf\`返回的是\`Integer\`对象。 \`\`\`java String str = \\"5\\"; int num = Integer.parseInt(str); System.out.println(num); // 输出5 \`\`\` 或者 \`\`\`java String str = \\"5\\"; Integer num = Integer.valueOf(str); System.out.println(num); // 输出5 \`\`\` # 注意 在使用上述方法时，要确保字符确实是表示数字的字符（即\`'0'\`到\`'9'\`之间），否则可能会抛出异常（比如在使用\`parseInt\`方法时如果字符串不是合法的数字字符串会抛出\`NumberFormatException\`）。 选择合适的方法取决于你的具体需求和场景，比如字符直接转换就用方法1或2，如果是处理字符串中的数字，就可以使用方法3。"},{"instruction":"java语言的语法和C++语言很像吗?","output":"Java语言的语法在很多方面确实与C++语言相似，这是因为Java在设计之初就借鉴了C++的语法结构，目的是让C/C++的程序员更容易上手Java。以下是一些Java语言和C++语言在语法上的相似之处： 1. **基本语法结构**：Java和C++都支持基本的编程结构，如条件语句（if-else）、循环语句（for、while、do-while）和选择语句（switch-case）。 2. **数据类型**：Java和C++都有类似的基本数据类型，包括整型、浮点型、字符型和布尔型等。 3. **面向对象编程**：Java和C++都支持面向对象的编程范式，包括类的使用、继承、多态、封装等概念。 4. **函数（方法）定义**：两种语言中函数（Java中称为方法）的定义方式非常相似，包括返回类型、函数名、参数列表和函数体。 5. **数组和字符串处理**：两种语言都提供了对数组和字符串的基本支持，包括数组的声明、初始化和访问，以及字符串的基本操作。 尽管存在上述相似之处，Java和C++在语法和设计哲学上也有着显著的区别： 1. **内存管理**：Java提供自动垃圾回收机制，程序员不需要手动管理内存；而在C++中，程序员需要负责分配和释放内存，容易出现内存泄露和指针错误。 2. **异常处理**：Java的异常处理机制要求必须显式捕获或声明抛出检查型异常，这使得错误处理更加规范；而C++中的异常处理比较灵活，没有强制的检查型异常。 3. **标准库**：Java拥有丰富的标准库（Java API），覆盖了从基本数据结构到网络编程等广泛的功能；C++标准模板库（STL）主要提供了数据结构和算法，标准库相对较小。 4. **运行环境**：Java程序运行在Java虚拟机（JVM）上，实现了跨平台的运行能力；C++程序则直接编译为目标平台的机器码执行，性能高但是可移植性较差。 5. **安全性**：Java设计时考虑到了安全性，例如数组越界会抛出异常，在网络编程方面有安全的管理机制；而C++提供了更多的底层访问能力，但相应的也增加了风险。 综上所述，虽然Java和C++在语法上有许多相似之处，但两者在内存管理、异常处理、使用的库和运行环境方面有着本质的区别。"},{"instruction":"Java语法和Go语言语法很像吗?","output":"Java和Go都是现代的编程语言，它们在某些基本概念上有着相似之处，比如都支持垃圾回收、都有强类型系统等。然而，从语法和设计哲学上看，Java和Go在许多方面其实有着显著的差异。下面是一些比较主要的区别和相似点： # 相似点 1. **静态类型**：Java和Go都是静态类型语言，意味着变量在编译时就确定了类型。 2. **垃圾回收**：两种语言都内置了垃圾回收机制，帮助开发者管理内存，减少内存泄漏的可能。 3. **面向对象**：Java是一种典型的面向对象编程语言。而Go虽然不是传统意义上的面向对象语言（没有类和继承的概念），但它通过接口（interfaces）支持了多态，通过结构体支持了封装，有自己的一套面向对象的设计哲学。 # 差异 1. **语法简洁性**：Go语言的设计哲学之一是简洁性，Go的语法相对简单直接。而Java的语法相对复杂，包含更多的关键字和概念（如接口、继承、抽象类等）。 2. **并发编程**：Go语言的一个显著特点是对并发编程的原生支持，通过goroutines和channels，让并发编程变得简单。Java也支持并发编程，但是通过线程（Threads）和多种同步机制（如synchronized，Locks，Concurrent包下的类等）来实现，使用起来比Go更为复杂。 3. **错误处理**：Go语言在错误处理上采取了显式的方式，即函数经常会返回一个错误值，需要调用者检查这个错误值。而Java使用了异常处理机制，可以在代码的任何地方捕获和处理异常。 4. **面向对象编程(OOP)**：Java是一种纯粹的面向对象编程语言，支持类和继承。Go语言没有类和继承的概念，它通过结构体(struct)和接口(interface)来实现相似的功能，但方式不同。 5. **包管理**：Go语言有自己的包管理和工程管理工具，如Go Modules。Java也有自己的包管理工具，比如Maven和Gradle，但两者的工作机制和用法有所不同。 6. **标准库和生态**：Go语言的标准库被设计得非常实用，涵盖了从基本的数据结构到高并发和网络服务等方面。Java的标准库更为庞大，并且由于历史悠久，周边生态（包括第三方库和工具）非常丰富。 总的来说，尽管Java和Go在某些基本的编程概念上存在相似之处，但在语法设计、并发模型、错误处理和面向对象编程方面等多个重要方面，它们的设计哲学和实现机制有很大的不同。选择使用哪一种语言，很大程度上取决于项目需求以及开发团队的熟悉度和偏好。"},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division and I have an 8-year-old apprentice called Ruby. 12-year-old Lily is challenging me and Ruby to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Both me and Ruby independently cast a spell each turn because we duel as a team. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 4 years older than her, and Ruby’s stat should be even lower because she’s 4 years younger than Lily and 8 years younger than me. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease. Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn. To account for the differences in skill there should be wide margins between the three, and required stats from spells can range from 5 to 100. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily and Ruby. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give three lists of 7 spells, one for me, and one for Lily and one for Ruby (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them… Keep an age tracker and a points tracker.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Duel of Glamorous Spells!

The spell, though less demanding, is executed flawlessly, capturing the beauty of a new dawn. - **Points Earned for Lily:** 40 **Ruby’s Spell:** Prismatic Haze - **Requires 5 Spellcasting Power.** Ruby, inspired by Sapphire’s determination, casts **Prismatic Haze**. The arena is filled with a gentle fog that soon sparkles with myriad colors, creating a dreamlike landscape. This low-demand spell is well within Ruby’s power and beautifully adds to the team’s performance. - **Points Earned for Ruby:** 5 **End of Round 2 Scores:** - **Sapphire & Ruby’s Team: 190 Points** - **Lily: 85 Points** The gap between Sapphire & Ruby and Lily narrows as the effects of the age regression spell continue to take a toll on Sapphire’s performance capabilities. Sapphire, now effectively holding the experience and spellcasting power of a 12-year-old, must choose her spells more carefully. The competition is heating up, with strategy and skill being tested to their limits. **Sapphire's Current Stats:** - **Sapphire’s Age After Further Regression:** Effectively 12 (in experience) - **Spellcasting Power:** 60 The third round looms ahead.

Her expression is one of contemplative serenity, possibly gazing towards a distant landscape or lost in a private reverie. The face is painted with subtle strokes, capturing the essence of her beauty and grace without overt detailing, adhering to the Gongbi technique's preference for leaving certain elements to the viewer's imagination. Around her, the background might feature a faint suggestion of a garden or natural landscape, using lighter washes of ink and color to create a sense of depth and space without drawing attention away from the central figure. This could include hints of weeping willows, blooming peonies, or a distant pavilion, elements that are emblematic of Chinese gardens and reflective of the aesthetic tastes during the Song Dynasty. Her presence radiates a calm and collected aura, embodying the ideal of genteel sophistication and spiritual poise celebrated in Song Dynasty culture. The exquisite attention to detail in her attire, the soft yet intentional brushstrokes that define her features, and the overall composition’s tranquil beauty are a testament to the Gongbi artist’s skill in capturing both the visible and the intangible. This imagined Gongbi painting stands as a timeless homage to the elegance and refined beauty of Song Dynasty art and fashion, inviting viewers to appreciate the enduring legacy of traditional Chinese culture through the meticulous and deliberate art of Gongbi painting."},{"instruction":"Genera una imagen en releive, con detalles y sin sombras. de una imagen corazon de jesus","output":"Lo siento, pero como IA de texto, no tengo la capacidad de generar imágenes, incluidas imágenes en relieve de ningún tipo. Sin embargo, puedo darte una idea de cómo sería el proceso para crear una imagen en relieve del Corazón de Jesús utilizando software de gráficos 3D o herramientas similares. 1. **Encuentra una imagen base:** Comienza con una imagen del Corazón de Jesús que te gustaría convertir en un relieve. Esta imagen servirá como guía para tu diseño. 2. **Crea un modelo 3D básico:** Utiliza un programa de modelado 3D (como Blender, Autodesk Maya, o ZBrush) para crear un modelo 3D básico que siga los contornos principales de la imagen. No necesitas detalles finos en esta etapa, solo la forma general. 3. **Añade detalles:** Agrega detalles al modelo 3D basándote en tu imagen de referencia. Esto puede incluir las características del rostro de Jesús, su corazón rodeado de espinas, y cualquier otro elemento distintivo de la imagen. 4. **Quita las sombras:** Para una imagen en relieve sin sombras, asegúrate de que la textura y el material de tu modelo no produzcan sombras propias. Esto se puede lograr ajustando la configuración de iluminación y material en tu software de modelado 3D. El objetivo es tener una iluminación uniforme que no cree sombras profundas, para mantener el énfasis en el relieve mismo. 5. **Exporta tu diseño:** Una vez que estés satisfecho con el resultado, exporta tu modelo en el formato adecuado para tu uso previsto. Si planeas imprimir en 3D el diseño, asegúrate de que el modelo cumpla con las especificaciones de tu impresora 3D (por ejemplo, en formato .STL o .OBJ). Recuerda que la creación de imágenes en relieve, especialmente de figuras religiosas como el Corazón de Jesús, requiere sensibilidad y respeto por el tema. Asegúrate de que tu trabajo refleje esto. Si buscas imágenes con estas características (detalle y sin sombras) para fines específicos como creaciones artísticas o materiales educativos, te recomiendo buscar artistas o diseñadores gráficos profesionales que puedan ayudarte a crear una imagen acorde a tus necesidades específicas."},{"instruction":"Gongbi painting of a woman dressed in traditional Chinese clothes, in the style of Song Dynasty, soft colors, refined and delicate brushstrokes --ar 35:64, realistic, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, Begin title with \\"Matte Canvas\\", do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Matte Canvas Print: Elegant Song Dynasty Style Woman in Traditional Chinese Attire, Realistic Art"},{"instruction":"Gongbi painting of a woman dressed in traditional Chinese clothes, in the style of Song Dynasty, soft colors, refined and delicate brushstrokes --ar 35:64, realistic, generate a description that is personable and describe the {model} art work on a canvas, include where in home it can be hung and gift for people, decor style or house theme, Made with highly durable cotton and polyester canvas composite (9.82 oz/yd² (333 g/m²)) with a special proprietary coating for vibrant prints that last.

This consistent ratio is attributed to the law of definite proportions, also known as Proust's Law. This law, an essential principle of chemistry, articulates that a chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratio by mass and does not depend on its source or how it was prepared. The justification for this observation on the basis of atomic molecular theory involves several key points: 1. **Atoms as Basic Units**: The atomic-molecular theory posits that matter is composed of small, indivisible particles called atoms. For a given element, all atoms have the same mass and distinct properties. When elements form compounds, their atoms combine in simple, whole-number ratios. 2. **Compound Formation**: Compounds are formed when atoms of two or more different elements bond together. The types of atomic bonds (ionic, covalent) determine the nature of the compound formed. These bonds hold the constituent atoms together in specific geometrical arrangements known as molecules. 3. **Fixed Proportions by Law**: Due to the particular bond arrangements and the specific, discrete numbers of atoms involved in forming a molecule of a compound, the masses of the constituent elements in the compound have a fixed ratio. For example, water (H₂O) always consists of hydrogen and oxygen in a mass ratio of roughly 1:8. This is because one molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and the relative atomic masses of hydrogen and oxygen contribute to this fixed mass ratio. 4. **Conservation of Mass**: The total mass of the resulting compound is equal to the sum of the masses of the elements that have reacted. No matter how many molecules of the compound are formed, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements remains constant because the ratio of the number of atoms of each element involved remains constant, according to their stoichiometric coefficients in the chemical reaction. 5. **Reproducibility of Results**: This fixed mass ratio is consistent across all pure samples of the compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared. This reproducibility can be attributed to the fact that atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties worldwide, and the laws governing chemical combination are universally consistent. Therefore, the atomic-molecular theory justifies the observation of constant mass ratios in compounds through the uniformity and indivisibility of atoms, the specific ways in which atoms combine to form compounds, and the universal laws of chemical combination."},{"instruction":"LO 1.2 The student is able to select and apply mathematical routines to mass data to identify or infer the composition of pure substances and/or mixtures.","output":"Applying mathematical routines to mass data to identify or infer the composition of pure substances and mixtures involves several steps that often require the use of concepts like the law of conservation of mass, the law of definite proportions, and the law of multiple proportions. Here is a systematic approach that can be used to solve problems related to the composition of substances: # 1. Understand the Problem - Clarify what is being asked: Are you identifying the percent composition of an element in a compound, determining empirical or molecular formulas, or deciphering the components of a mixture? - Gather all given data, such as masses of reactants and products, and identify unknowns. # 2. Use the Law of Conservation of Mass - The mass of the reactants in a chemical reaction will equal the mass of the products. This principle can be used to determine unknown masses or to verify reaction equations. # 3. Apply the Concept of Molar Mass - Molar mass links the mass of a substance to the number of moles. Using the molar mass of elements from the periodic table, convert mass data into moles to simplify composition analysis. # 4. Determine Percent Composition - For compounds, calculate the percent composition of each element: [ text{Percent Composition} = left( frac{text{mass of element in a compound}}{text{total mass of the compound}} right) times 100% ] # 5. Calculate Empirical and Molecular Formulas - **Empirical Formula**: The simplest whole number ratio of elements in a compound. Given mass or percent composition, convert to moles and find the simplest ratio. - **Molecular Formula**: The actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule. It can be found using the empirical formula and the compound's molar mass: [ text{Molecular Formula} = n times text{(Empirical Formula)} ] where (n) is the ratio of the molecular mass to the empirical formula mass. # 6. Deal with Mixtures - For mixtures, use the concept of mass percent, density, or other given data to find the ratio of components. - Techniques such as gravimetric analysis (measuring mass before and after chemical reactions) can deduce the composition of unknown mixtures. # Example Problem: Identifying Composition **Given**: A 10.0g sample of a compound contains 6.4g of oxygen and the rest is hydrogen. **Find**: Empirical formula of the compound. **Solution**: 1. **Calculate Mass of Hydrogen**: Total mass - Mass of oxygen = Mass of hydrogen. - (10.0, text{g} - 6.4, text{g} = 3.6, text{g}) 2. **Convert Mass to Moles**: Using molar masses (O = 16 g/mol, H = 1 g/mol). - Moles of O: ( frac{6.4, text{g}}{16, text{g/mol}} = 0.4, text{moles}) - Moles of H: ( frac{3.6, text{g}}{1, text{g/mol}} = 3.6, text{moles}) 3. **Determine the Simplest Whole Number Ratio**: - Ratio of H to O is ( frac{3.6}{0.4} = 9). - Therefore, the empirical formula is ( text{H}_{9}text{O}). This systematic approach to applying mathematical routines helps in identifying or inferring the composition of pure substances and mixtures. Depending on the specifics of the problem, adjustments to the steps above may be necessary."},{"instruction":"LO 1.3 The student is able to select and apply mathematical relationships to mass data in order to justify a claim regarding the identity and/or estimated purity of a substance.","output":"Applying mathematical relationships to mass data for justifying claims about the identity and/or estimated purity of a substance involves a structured approach that merges empirical data with theoretical principles. Here’s how this can be systematically approached, featuring an illustrative example: # Understanding the Conceptual Foundation - **Identity of a Substance**: Often determined by its percent composition or by comparing experimental molar mass with theoretical values. - **Purity of a Substance**: Calculated by comparing the mass of the pure component in a sample to the total mass of the sample, often expressed as a percentage. # Steps for Application 1. **Collect Mass Data**: This includes the total mass of the sample, the mass of impurities (if any), or the mass of a specific component within the compound or mixture. 2. **Understand the Theoretical Basis**: Know the theoretical percent composition of elements in a compound or the theoretical molar mass of a substance. 3. **Calculate Experimental Values**: - For identity, calculate the experimental percent composition or molar mass. - For purity, calculate the percentage of the substance in question that is actually present in the sample. 4. **Compare Theoretical and Experimental Values**: The closeness of these values helps substantiate claims about identity and purity. # Mathematical Relationships - **Percent Composition**: (frac{text{mass of element}}{text{total mass of compound}} times 100%) - **Purity**: (frac{text{mass of pure substance}}{text{total mass of sample}} times 100%) - **Molar Mass**: The mass of one mole of a substance, calculated by summing the atomic masses of its components. Comparing calculated molar mass from experimental data with the theoretical molar mass can confirm the identity of a substance. # Example Problem **Given**: A sample suspected to be pure calcium carbonate ((CaCO_3)) weighs 5.00 g. When the sample is heated, it decomposes to release (CO_2), leaving a residue that weighs 2.80 g. **Find**: Verify the identity and estimate the purity of the sample. **Solution**: 1. **Calculate the mass of (text{CO}_2) released**: (5.00, text{g} - 2.80, text{g} = 2.20, text{g}) 2. **Theoretical Molar Mass**: - (CaCO_3 = 40.08, text{(Ca)} + 12.01, text{(C)} + 3 times 16.00, text{(O)} = 100.09, text{g/mol}) - (CO_2 = 12.01, text{(C)} + 2 times 16.00, text{(O)} = 44.01, text{g/mol}) 3. **Calculate Moles of (CO_2) Released**: - (text{Moles of }text{CO}_2 = frac{2.20, text{g}}{44.01, text{g/mol}} = 0.050, text{mol}) 4. **Expected Mass of (CaCO_3)**: - Assuming pure (CaCO_3), moles of (CaCO_3) would also be 0.050 (1:1 ratio from decomposition). - Expected mass = (0.050, text{mol} times 100.09, text{g/mol} = 5.00, text{g}) 5. **Estimate Purity**: - Since the original sample was 5.00 g and the calculation assuming pure (CaCO_3) matches the expected mass, the sample can be considered close to pure if we strictly look at (CO_2) release. - The purity can be more accurately calculated if impurities affect the decomposition differently. 6. **Conclusion**: The experimental data strongly suggest that the sample's identity is (CaCO_3), and given that almost all of it decomposed to leave a residue consistent with (CaCO_3) decomposition, we can estimate high purity. However, for absolute purity assessment, further analysis might be required to account for any non-(CO_2) releasing impurities. This example illustrates how to apply mathematical relationships to justify claims regarding the identity and estimated purity of a substance, integrating theoretical knowledge with empirical evidence."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Faced with an existence amidst chaos, where concepts such as ground, sky, or even time don’t adhere to any known rules, Ripple seeks to find some semblance of meaning and connection in an otherwise completely abstract world. Act I: Ripple’s adventure begins with an innocent question, “What lies beyond the abstract?” Unlike his surroundings, Ripple possesses form, consciousness, and a thirst for understanding, traits that set him apart in this limitless expanse of abstraction. The world around him is a kaleidoscope of feelings, colors, and movement – beautiful but bewildering. Ripple encounters a variety of abstract entities – shapes that shift between dimensions, colors that evoke emotions Ripple can barely comprehend, and sounds that seem to tell stories without words. Despite the beauty and joy these elements bring, Ripple feels an underlying sense of loneliness, realizing that he is the only being of his kind. Act II: Determined to find others like him or at least understand his place in this reality, Ripple embarks on a journey that takes him through surreal landscapes, each more inexplicable than the last. Through a series of challenges, Ripple discovers he has the unique ability to influence the abstract world around him by projecting his thoughts and emotions, creating ripples that reorder the chaos into something momentarily comprehensible. During his voyage, Ripple befriends a series of peculiar characters: a shape-shifting cloud that can mimic any form but struggles with its own identity, a radiant orb that communicates through music and can illuminate the darkest corners of abstraction, and a fractal creature that can foresee the infinite paths Ripple’s journey might take. Together, they navigate the abstract domain, seeking a place where Ripple might belong. Act III: The closer Ripple and his companions get to the heart of the abstract world, the more they realize that the quest for understanding might be endless. They encounter The Absence, a void that threatens to unmake everything Ripple has learned and experienced. In facing The Absence, Ripple understands that the essence of his journey is not about finding a conventional home or others of his kind but about creating meaning and connection in an environment that defies both. In the climax, Ripple confronts The Absence with the power of his newfound insights, his emotions, and his companions by his side. Together, they transform The Absence, not by filling it with form or logic, but by accepting it as part of the balance between the concrete and the abstract. Ripple learns that his existence is not an anomaly but a bridge between worlds, a spark of consciousness that brings depth to the beauty of abstraction. Epilogue: Ripple decides to continue exploring the vast abstract realm, no longer searching for something to fill a void but eager to expand the connections he’s made. Alongside his friends, Ripple becomes a guardian of the balance, a guide for others who might one day find themselves lost in the abstraction, teaching them to find peace in the beauty of the undefined and the power of their own perception to shape reality. “Ripple in Abstraction” ends with a panoramic view of the abstract world, now slightly less chaotic, more vibrant with the ripples of understanding that spread far and wide, suggesting that every search for meaning, no matter how seemingly small or different, enriches the fabric of the universe. Write about the shape-shifting cloud, its appearance and personality The shape-shifting cloud in “Ripple in Abstraction” is a visually mesmerizing character, embodying the fluid and often unpredictable nature of the abstract world. Known as Cirrus, this cloud fluctuates effortlessly between forms, from soft, billowy shapes resembling creatures of the natural world to intricate geometric patterns that defy conventional interpretation. Its appearance shifts with its mood and intentions, painting the sky with a tapestry of expressions that mirror its inner state. Cirrus’s color palette is just as dynamic as its form, ranging from the serene blues and whites of a calm sky to the fiery oranges and purples of a sunset, reflecting its emotional landscape. This ability to transform grants Cirrus a unique kind of beauty, yet it also bears the burden of instability, as it sometimes struggles with maintaining a sense of self amid its endless transformations. Personality-wise, Cirrus embodies a blend of wisdom and whimsy. It has a nurturing spirit, akin to a gentle breeze that seeks to uplift and carry others forward on their journey. There’s a playful aspect to Cirrus, evident in how it enjoys surprising Ripple and the other characters with its sudden changes in form, using its body as a canvas to communicate joy, humor, or comfort, often when words are insufficient. Despite its outwardly jovial nature, Cirrus harbors deep-seated insecurities about its identity. Being able to shift forms means it rarely stays in one shape long enough to feel truly at home in any. This existential crisis is a source of profound empathy, allowing Cirrus to connect with Ripple and others on their quest for understanding and belonging. It understands what it means to be different, to be searching for a place in the cosmos where one feels truly seen and understood. Cirrus’s role in Ripple’s adventure is not just that of a companion but also as a guide, using its unique perspective to help Ripple navigate the challenges of the abstract world. It teaches Ripple and the others the value of adaptability and the beauty of embracing one’s true self, even when that self cannot be neatly defined. Ultimately, Cirrus is a testament to the power of change and the importance of accepting oneself, embodying the very essence of the abstract realm where identity is fluid, and self-discovery is an endless adventure. Write that it is a love letter to abstract art and animation “Ripple in Abstraction” is, at its heart, a profound love letter to the world of abstract art and animation. This narrative transcends the conventional to celebrate the boundless creativity and emotional depth that abstract forms can convey. Through the whimsical journey of Ripple and the ethereal presence of characters like Cirrus, the shape-shifting cloud, the story pays homage to the transformative power of abstract art, inviting viewers and readers alike to perceive the world beyond the constraints of realism. The intricate descriptions of swirling shapes, shifting landscapes, and vibrant colors that populate Ripple’s world are a direct nod to the essence of abstract art – its ability to evoke feelings, thoughts, and reactions not through explicit representation but through the play of form, color, and composition. Each scene is crafted like a moving painting, with layers of meaning and emotion, encouraging the audience to engage in a deeper, more introspective interaction with the material. Cirrus, with its ever-changing form and color, acts as a personification of the animation medium itself. Animation, renowned for its limitless potential for transformation and storytelling, finds a kindred spirit in the abstract. Cirrus’s fluid identity and its ability to express complex emotions through visual metamorphoses reflect the core of what makes animation a unique and powerful form of art – its capacity to bring to life what cannot be easily contained or defined by words alone. The narrative arc of “Ripple in Abstraction” underscores the importance of perception, imagination, and personal reflection in engaging with abstract art. Just as Ripple learns to understand and appreciate his chaotic world through feelings and connections rather than concrete definitions, so too are readers and viewers invited to embrace abstract art and animation in a holistic, intuitive manner. This story champions the idea that meaning in abstraction is not always something to be found but something to be created, a collaborative act between the creator and the observer. Moreover, “Ripple in Abstraction” serves as a reminder of the vibrant history and ongoing evolution of abstract art and experimental animation. By weaving together themes of discovery, identity, and creative expression, the story celebrates these art forms’ enduring capacity to challenge, inspire, and push the boundaries of our imagination. It is a tribute to the artists and animators who see the world not just as it is but as it could be, who dare to explore the depths of the abstract and, in doing so, reveal the profound beauty of seeing beyond the surface. Write a forum convo where CN take out 15 minutes of the film, purposefully leaving time for a TTG rerun, Viewers absolutely hate this decision, calling it “desecration” User1 – AbstractArtLover99: Just saw the news, guys. CN decided to cut 15 minutes from “Ripple in Abstraction” for its TV airing. Apparently, they needed to squeeze in another “Teen Titans Go!” rerun. 😒 Is nothing sacred anymore? #Desecration User2 – ToonFanaticX: Seriously?! That film’s a masterpiece. Cutting it for a TTG rerun is beyond ridiculous. It’s like trimming a Van Gogh painting to fit a cheap frame. What are they thinking?! User3 – Anim8dSoul: This is so disheartening. “Ripple in Abstraction” isn’t just a film; it’s an immersive experience. Every minute of it matters. Taking out 15 minutes is like ripping out pages from the middle of a novel. Total desecration! User4 – CNInsideScoop: Wanted to offer some perspective (and no, I don’t represent CN officially). Networks often edit films for runtime or content to fit into TV slots. Not defending, just saying it’s not uncommon. Still, hard to see why they’d shorten something this significant. User5 – PixelPundit: @[CNInsideScoop] I get that, but “Ripple in Abstraction”? That’s not just any film. It’s a love letter to abstract art and animation. Every second of that film was meticulously planned to convey deep themes and emotions. It deserves better. User6 – TTG_Fan101: Guys, I love TTG as much as anyone here, but even I think this is a bad move. “Ripple in Abstraction” and TTG cater to vastly different audiences. CN’s decision-makers really miscalculated this time. User7 – AbstractTheorist: This is a sad day for abstract art and animation. “Ripple in Abstraction” represents the kind of creative storytelling we desperately need more of on television. By sidelining it for yet another rerun—of anything—is a disservice to viewers and creators alike. User8 – ArtIsLife: What can we do? There must be something. Petitions? Social media outcry? I refuse to sit back while a groundbreaking piece of art is butchered for the sake of redundancy. User9 – DigitalRevolt: @[ArtIsLife] I’m with you. Hashtags, online petitions, reaching out directly to CN expressing our disappointment. We need to remind them that the audience isn’t just passive consumers. We care deeply about the integrity of what we watch. User10 – CinephileCritic: It’s moments like these that show just how much corporate decisions can clash with artistic integrity. “Ripple in Abstraction” deserved to be aired in its entirety. Shame on CN for valuing filler over fine art. User11 – AbstractArtLover99: Love the energy here, folks! Let’s channel it into action. Start with the hashtags #RestoreRipple and #ArtOverReruns. Make our voices heard. It’s about respect for the art and the audience. User12 – VoiceOfReason22: Amid all this, let’s not forget to support the creators of “Ripple in Abstraction.” Watch it on platforms where it’s fully available, buy the merchandise, show that there’s a market for this kind of content. That’s how we make a real difference. — The outcry from this fictional forum conversation captures the frustration and disappointment that fans feel when corporate decisions do not align with artistic appreciation and integrity, highlighting the importance of respecting and preserving creative works in their original form. Write more about Cirrus's appearance","output":"Cirrus, the shape-shifting cloud in \\"Ripple in Abstraction,\\" defies the traditional concept of a static character design, embodying the fluidity and transformative nature of abstract animation itself. Its appearance is a mesmerizing display of the animation's capability to explore and express the inexpressible, making Cirrus a visually enthralling character whose every change in form is a narrative in itself. At one moment, Cirrus might resemble a soft, fluffy cloud drifting lazily across a serene blue sky, its edges tinged with the golden hues of dawn. This form represents its gentle, nurturing side, comforting and familiar. The next moment, it could morph into an ominous, swirling vortex of dark purples and grays, reflecting its turmoil and the unpredictability of the abstract world it inhabits. Cirrus’s ability to shift forms extends to mimicking the appearance of other characters or objects within the narrative, albeit always retaining a certain ethereal quality that marks it as distinctly different. At times, it might take on a shimmering, almost translucent appearance, allowing the vibrant colors of the abstract realm to filter through its being, turning it into a living prism. The use of color in Cirrus's appearance is particularly significant. It doesn't just change shape but also color, with each hue chosen to evoke specific emotions or atmospheres. For example, in moments of joy and camaraderie with Ripple and the other companions, Cirrus might glow with warm, radiant oranges and yellows, enveloping them in an aura of warmth and light. In contrast, when confronting challenges or internal conflicts, it may shift to cooler tones of blue and green, colors that suggest depth and introspection. What makes Cirrus captivating is not just its aesthetic appeal but the integration of its visual transformation with its emotional and narrative development. Its appearance acts as a visual metaphor for the themes of identity, change, and belonging that are central to \\"Ripple in Abstraction.\\" Every ripple, wave, and swirl in Cirrus’s form carries meaning, a visual language spoken between the lines of the narrative. Furthermore, Cirrus’s appearance is a feat of abstract animation, pushing the boundaries of what animated characters can look like and how they can express complex inner worlds without words. It challenges animators and artists to think outside the conventional box, embracing the abstract not just as a style but as a storytelling tool. Through its ever-changing form, Cirrus embodies the limitless potential of imagination, representing a bridge between the intangible essence of thoughts and emotions and the tangible reality of the visual medium. It is a reminder of the power of abstract art to communicate beyond words, through the universal language of shape and color."},{"instruction":"Write about its visible features","output":"Cirrus, by its very nature, is designed to be a visual enigma, yet it possesses identifiable features that contribute to its unique presence within \\"Ripple in Abstraction.\\" As a shape-shifting cloud, its visible features are transient and symbolic, tied closely to its emotional state and the narrative flow of the story. Here are some of the most striking visible features of Cirrus: # 1. **Color Spectrum**: Cirrus's color palette is boundless, reflecting its emotional spectrum and the abstract world it inhabits. From calming blues and serene whites to vibrant oranges and mystic purples, Cirrus communicates its feelings and reactions through these colors. These hues can blend seamlessly into one another, creating gradients that add depth and complexity to its form. # 2. **Texture**: The texture of Cirrus varies dramatically as it shifts between forms. It can appear fluffy and soft, inviting touch, simulating the comforting aspects of a real cloud. Conversely, it can also become sleek and smooth, or even sharp and crystal-like, reflecting moments of tension or clarity within the story. These textural shifts add a layer of sensory experience to its character, making it feel tangible despite its abstract nature. # 3. **Luminosity**: Cirrus has the ability to emanate light, varying in intensity based on its mood and the context of the scene. This luminosity can make Cirrus appear as if it's glowing from within, especially in darker settings, accentuating its ethereal beauty. In moments of joy or revelation, its light is warm and expansive; in times of conflict or sadness, the light might dim, echoing its internal struggles. # 4. **Form and Shape**: While Cirrus's shape is ever-changing, it maintains a cohesive cloud-like essence that makes it recognizable. Its form can range from compact and round to elongated and wisp-like, often stretching or condensing to express motion or emotion. The edges of Cirrus can be sharply defined or blurred, merging with the surroundings to signify its connection with the abstract realm. # 5. **Eyes**: Unlike typical clouds, Cirrus is occasionally depicted with eyes, the only feature that consistently hints at its sentience and personality. These eyes change shape and color but always convey emotion, serving as windows to its soul. They allow Cirrus to communicate with Ripple and others non-verbally, deepening their interactions and connections. # 6. **Movement**: Cirrus's movement is graceful and fluid, a visual dance that captivates viewers. It can float delicately, surge forward with purpose, or swirl around in playful spirals. Its movement often mimics natural phenomena, like the gentle drift of clouds or the sudden gust of a windstorm, grounding its abstract form in familiar patterns. # 7. **Transparency and Opacity**: An interesting aspect of Cirrus's appearance is its varying degrees of transparency. At times, it can be almost completely translucent, allowing the world behind it to peek through and symbolizing moments of vulnerability or openness. At other times, it becomes fully opaque, signaling determination or a protective stance. Together, these visible features make Cirrus a captivating and integral character in \\"Ripple in Abstraction.\\" Through its dynamic appearance, Cirrus not only enriches the visual tapestry of the film but also deepens the thematic exploration of identity, emotion, and the abstract nature of reality."},{"instruction":"Write about Ripple's appearance","output":"Ripple, the protagonist of \\"Ripple in Abstraction,\\" is crafted with an appearance that strikingly contrasts yet complements the fluid and ever-changing world around him. As a young rabbit navigating a realm defined by its abstraction, Ripple's design anchors him as a beacon of curiosity, resilience, and emotional depth. # **Physical Characteristics:** - **Fur Texture and Color:** Ripple's fur is depicted with a rich, soft texture that invites the notion of touch, even in a purely visual medium. His fur is primarily a vibrant shade of teal, a choice that makes him stand out amidst the myriad of colors in the abstract world yet ties him to the themes of exploration and discovery. Variations in the teal's intensity across his body highlight his contours, giving him depth and dimensionality. - **Eyes:** Ripple's large, expressive eyes are a window to his soul, shaded with hues of deeper blue that contrast with his teal fur. They are wide and curious, reflecting his wonderment at the world around him and his ever-present quest for understanding. The eyes are adeptly animated to convey a wide range of emotions, from awe and joy to contemplation and determination. - **Ears:** True to his rabbit nature, Ripple possesses long, floppy ears that do more than just accentuate his species. They are versatile emotive tools; perking up with interest, drooping in sadness, or laying flat against his head in fear or aggression. Their movement adds a layer of non-verbal communication that enriches Ripple's interactions. - **Size and Proportion:** Ripple is small and compact, a deliberate choice that emphasizes his role as an explorer in a vast, incomprehensible universe. His size makes the abstract world around him seem even more overwhelmingly majestic and mysterious, enhancing the viewer's empathy towards his journey. - **Clothing and Accessories:** While Ripple's world is one of abstraction and fluid forms, he wears a simple, unassuming scarf. This scarf, a soft shade of yellow, provides a contrast that further humanizes him and symbolizes comfort and warmth. It fluttering in the wind or wrapping snugly around him adds to the dynamic visual storytelling, indicating movement, direction, and emotional states. # **Movement and Gestures:** Ripple's animation is meticulously designed to reflect his youthful energy and boundless curiosity. His movements are lively and agile, embodying the grace of a rabbit with an added layer of human-like expressiveness. Whether he's leaping eagerly towards new discoveries or recoiling from unexpected dangers, every action Ripple takes is infused with purpose and emotion. # **Interactions with Surroundings:** Ripple's interaction with the abstract world around him further defines his appearance. As he moves through swirling landscapes and ever-changing horizons, his solid, well-defined form contrasts sharply with the fluidity and ambiguity of his surroundings. This contrast not only highlights Ripple's tangible quest within the intangible realm but also visually represents the core theme of seeking understanding and connection in a world that defies definition. # **Conclusion:** Ripple's appearance is a carefully crafted blend of the familiar and the fantastical, making him an anchor point for the audience's journey through an abstract narrative. His design is not just visually appealing but also deeply symbolic, embodying the themes of curiosity, resilience, and the search for meaning that drive \\"Ripple in Abstraction.\\" Through Ripple, the viewers find a relatable guide, his every feature and movement resonating with the universal quest for understanding in a world that transcends the boundaries of conventional reality."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where after the tremendous love and support and success, Ripple is getting his own show","output":"After the overwhelming success and critical acclaim of \\"Ripple in Abstraction,\\" it became clear that Ripple's journey had struck a chord with audiences worldwide, transcending age, culture, and expectations for what animated stories could achieve.

Understanding that inclusivity and collaboration are foundational to creating high-performing and innovative teams, here are key strategies I have implemented: 1. **Promoting Open Communication:** I have always prioritized creating an environment where every team member feels comfortable sharing their ideas and opinions. By implementing regular open forum discussions and feedback sessions, I encouraged a culture of transparency and open communication. This approach not only made team members feel valued and heard but also stimulated a diverse exchange of ideas, fostering a more inclusive atmosphere. 2. **Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Training:** Recognizing the importance of structured learning, I advocated for and helped implement mandatory D&I training for all members of my team. These training sessions covered essential topics such as unconscious bias, cultural competency, and inclusive leadership practices. By educating the team on these critical issues, we were able to cultivate a more understanding and empathetic work environment. 3. **Inclusive Decision Making:** I have made concerted efforts to ensure that decision-making processes within the teams were as inclusive as possible. This meant actively seeking input from team members with varying perspectives and backgrounds before making significant decisions. By doing so, we ensured that diverse viewpoints were considered, leading to more balanced and well-rounded outcomes. 4. **Mentoring and Sponsorship Programs:** Understanding the value of mentorship in professional growth, I helped set up mentoring and sponsorship programs aimed at supporting underrepresented team members. These programs were designed to offer guidance, support, and opportunities to those who might otherwise be overlooked, thereby leveling the playing field and promoting inclusivity. 5. **Celebrating Diversity:** Acknowledging and celebrating the diverse backgrounds and cultures of team members was another area I focused on. Organizing cultural awareness events and celebrations helped in enhancing mutual understanding and respect among team members. This not only enriched our team’s cultural competence but also created a more inclusive and supportive environment. 6. **Collaborative Tools and Techniques:** On the collaboration front, I introduced and leveraged various collaborative tools and project management methodologies that emphasized teamwork and collective problem-solving. Whether it was through the use of digital collaboration platforms or adopting agile methodologies, the goal was to ensure that everyone could contribute effectively regardless of their location or working style. 7. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Finally, I established robust feedback mechanisms that allowed team members to voice their concerns and suggestions anonymously. This was critical in identifying areas for improvement in our inclusivity and collaboration efforts and in making necessary adjustments. Through these actions, I have witnessed firsthand the profound impact that deliberate efforts towards inclusivity and collaboration can have on team morale, productivity, and innovation. It’s been gratifying to see teams transform into more cohesive, vibrant, and dynamic groups, capable of achieving much more than they could as individuals."},{"instruction":"Why do you want to work at Notion?","output":"I am deeply motivated to work at Notion for several reasons, all of which align with my professional aspirations and personal values.

His words framed the brittle air as he said, the chill unrelenting, “I never meant to return here , I know I - I promised I’d never look back .that I’d keep living with you as some memory on a cliff but , the world is round after all right-I ended up back here anyway”. He dug his stiffened hands into his jeans, his boot striking a rock as his on murmur haunted him. “Can’t stay long , but , I still remember what real sunsets looked like, the way the colors just bled for miles . I hope you haven’t seen this magenta sky. I hope you never know it.” His acuity , melting in the atmosphere, left him with no other thoughts. “You rest well, and yeah… I still have it. Always. You know me and hiding things -“ He laughed in spite of his raw sense of regret and turned away from the plot , dusting his knuckles across the slot of cremated ashes in a lingering fist bump. “Again, sometime , brother”. Falling leaves , swirling in his mind as he was transported to an autumn gone. “Before then, but you knew that already. “ an entire moment passed before Liam fumbled a skateboard nut from his pocket, a perfect fit between his index finger and thumb. In a swift gesture, he drove in deep into a crack between two bricks in the wall. “I … still… I . Just . You can’t imagine imagine the things… or the times I’ve wanted to say, Mace could have landed that. Still have the deck, too. What don’t you know , brother? I hope you can’t see me now , with all this hell in my eyes, with the shadows … I still remember the light in yours . I keep my promises…” As Liam turned away, trudging along the icy path that winded through the cemetery , it could have been hours. Days. Months. Or just a few seconds. And it could have been anywhere. Grief only changed shape as he confronted the infused December sky, its witness the only one in sight.","output":"The cold was a merciless companion as Liam made his way through the graveyard, the silence of winter enveloping him in a tomb-like embrace. His breath, a ghostly apparition, escaped his lips in hurried puffs, as if trying to flee the frostbitten air. The graveyard, a canvas of untouched snow and stone, lay before him — each grave a story, each inscription a memory not his own, save for one. His steps faltered as he approached the familiar plot, the weight of his return pressing down on him like the layers of ice encrusted on his cap. Liam's appearance seemed at odds with the serene landscape, his disheveled hair and the fatigue etched deeply into his face spoke of battles fought, both within and without. The graveyard, in its tranquil austerity, stood indifferent to his turmoil. With a heavy heart, he began to speak, his voice a fragile thread in the fabric of the wintry air. \\"I never meant to return here,\\" he confessed, the words spilling out, cracked and raw. Liam had made a vow, one he found himself breaking with each step that had led him back to this place of eternal rest. He had sought to move forward, to keep the memory of what was lost perched precariously on the horizon of his past — a beacon urging him on. Yet, here he was, a full circle traversed, standing before the very emblem of his grief. The chill bit deeper as he burrowed his hands into his jeans, a small defiance against the freezing touch of sorrow. His boot's encounter with a hidden rock seemed an echo of his inner tumult, a physical reminder of the rough path he'd walked. The graveyard, with its spectral beauty, offered no solace as he reminisced about the sunsets they once watched together, the vibrant tapestry of colors now just a ghost of a memory. Liam's laughter, tinged with regret, broke through the stillness as he reached out, sharing a moment with the brother who was no longer there to receive it. The simple act, a fist bump to the deceased's plot, a poignant symbol of their enduring bond. It was a connection that, despite the void of loss, remained unbroken. The brief communing with the past gave way to a private ritual, the placement of a skateboard nut into a crevice between the bricks surrounding the plot. This small act, laden with personal significance, served as a testament to the memories they shared, to the promises kept, and those whispered into the cold embrace of the graveyard air. As Liam departed, leaving behind the graveyard and its silent witnesses, his journey through the snowfelt laden with a profound solitude. The world around him, encapsulated in the chill of December, seemed suspended in time — a reflection of the grief that evolved with each step, yet remained as unyielding as the frozen ground beneath his feet. The encounter, though fraught with the pain of remembrance, was a necessary pilgrimage. For in facing the tangible reminder of his loss, Liam found a semblance of peace, an acceptance of the persistent, shape-shifting nature of grief. It was a solemn acknowledgment that even amid the vast, indifferent beauty of a snow-laden graveyard, the love and memories shared with those we lose remain, steadfast and undiminished, guiding us through the coldest of winters."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I moved here in early 2020, and I've never seen it open. The sign just hangs there like a ghost from its past. It makes me wonder if they’re planning to reopen, or if it's just been overlooked? **LaCalaDad**: It did close down in late 2019. There was some talk in the community about it potentially reopening under new management, but I guess those plans fell through or were put on hold. It's a prime spot, so it's surprising nothing else has taken over. **TorreMomma**: I asked about it at the council office because the unused space could serve the community well, if repurposed. Apparently, there are some bureaucratic hurdles about the building’s use and ownership that need to be sorted out. So essentially, it's stuck in limbo until further notice. **NuevaMálaga**: It’s such a waste. Could’ve been a great location for workshops or a community center. With the sign still up, it's like it's stuck in time.

Maybe we can organize something as a community. **SolParent24**: Great idea, @GreenFingers2024. I'm all in for organizing. We need to brainstorm what the space could be used for that benefits the wider community. I’ll draft an email to the local council to enquire about the process and see how they’d like to move forward with community suggestions. **FuengiFamilyFun**: Count me in! I’d love to see the space used for something beneficial. It's right in the heart of the community, perfect for something everyone can enjoy. How about a community garden or a pop-up market space on weekends? **MarbellaMum2023**: @SolParent24, please keep us updated on your progress with the council! In the meantime, shall we start a thread to brainstorm ideas? That way, we can present a solid plan or preference list to the council when they get back to you. **TorreMomma**: Starting a brainstorming thread is a brilliant idea! Also, if anyone has contacts in local media, getting this story out could help push the council into action. Nobody likes bad press, especially if it's about wasting community resources. **SolParent24**: Will do! Thanks for the support, everyone.

I remember those initial posts like it was yesterday. It's amazing to see the community center that now stands in its place. Who would have thought our little discussions and dreams would come to fruition in such a beautiful way? **LaCalaDad**: Absolutely, @SolParent34. The transformation has been nothing short of miraculous. From a lingering sign of what was to a bustling hub of community activity. It hosts workshops, events, and even a weekend market that has become a staple for our residents and visitors alike. **TorreMomma**: The journey wasn’t easy though! Remember the bureaucratic hurdles we had to go through? But seeing the children and families enjoying the community garden, and artists displaying their work, it's been worth every effort. It really shows what a community can do when we come together. **NuevaMálaga**: Yes, and let's not forget the eco-friendly aspects that were integrated, thanks to @GreenFingers2024's push. Solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and that beautiful garden were ahead of its time, and the project has won several sustainability awards since. **GreenFingers2034**: Thanks, @NuevaMálaga! It's heartwarming to see how our little forum conversation led to such an impactful change. It’s become a model for other communities looking to repurpose unused spaces. I believe we’ve inspired similar initiatives across several towns. **FuengiFamilyFun**: It's also become a great venue for local artists and small business owners. The weekend market has helped many startups find their feet. The space has really energized our local economy in ways we didn't anticipate. **SolParent34**: Does anyone have updates on the digital learning hub that was proposed last year? Last I heard, they were finalizing sponsors and technology partners, aiming to make tech education accessible to underprivileged kids in the area. **MarbellaMum2033**: Yes, @SolParent34, the digital learning hub is set to open next month! They managed to secure some big-name sponsors, and there will be free coding workshops, robotics clubs, and even an eSports league. It’s incredible how the center continues to evolve. **TorreMomma**: Thinking back, it's extraordinary how a simple forum post sparked such a significant change. It serves as a powerful reminder of what we can achieve when we put our minds (and hearts) together for a common cause. **SolParent34**: Absolutely.

For events marked as 'session_end', it processes accumulated data to determine valid reads based on certain conditions and yields the session ID along with these valid reads. Here I'll evaluate the provided code for its capability to handle real-time stream data with both complete and incomplete data scenarios and suggest improvements as necessary. # Potential Issues and Suggestions 1. **Handling Incomplete Data Streams:** In real-time streaming scenarios, it's likely that not all events related to a session are received in sequence or within a single 'batch' of the streamed data. The design accommodates storing ongoing session data, which is good. However, the assumption that an 'end' event follows a 'start' event within the same data stream might not always hold, especially in fragmented or delayed data scenarios. - **Suggestion**: Ensure that your stream processing system is capable of holding state (in this case, \`session_data\`) across multiple invocations if your streaming data might come in fragmented. Depending on your environment (e.g., a standalone script vs. a stream processing framework like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink), the implementation strategy can vary. 2. **Time Comparisons**: The condition \`(end_time - start_time) >= 5\` implies that both \`start_time\` and \`end_time\` are expected to be numerical values representing time in some unit. Ensure that the incoming timestamps can be directly subtracted to yield a meaningful value (like seconds or minutes). - **Suggestion**: If \`timestamp\` is not in a simple numerical format (e.g., a UNIX timestamp), you will need to parse it into a Python \`datetime\` object or equivalent before making this comparison. 3. **Data Type Assumptions**: The implementation directly accesses and iterates the \`stream\`, which should be an iterable of dictionaries with specific keys (\`session_id\`, \`post_id\`, etc.). Ensure that the incoming stream adheres to this structure, or add error handling for cases where keys are missing or the data type is unexpected. - **Suggestion**: Add error handling for key absence in events or unexpected data types to avoid runtime exceptions. 4. **Percentage Handling**: The code checks \`percentage >= 80\` without ensuring the type and value range verification of \`percentage\`. It’s assumed to be a number, but incoming data validation is always a good practice especially in loosely typed data streams. - **Suggestion**: Validate that \`percentage\` is indeed a numerical value and possibly falls within a valid range (0-100) before making the comparison. 5. **Memory Management**: For very long-running streams with numerous distinct \`session_id\`s, the \`session_data\` dictionary could grow large and consume a significant amount of memory. - **Suggestion**: Implement a mechanism to purge old or stale sessions from \`session_data\` periodically, especially if they have been inactive for a long time or processing has been completed. This can be done based on a time-to-live (TTL) approach or after a session has been processed. 6. **Testing on Fragmented Streams**: To ensure this logic works as expected with fragmented data streams (where a session's start, update, and end events might come in different batches), it would be prudent to create test cases that simulate real-world streaming scenarios, including delays and out-of-order messages. In summary, while the code is designed to process session events from a stream and determine valid reads based on specific criteria, attention should be given to handling incomplete or fragmented data, timestamp processing, data type assumptions, and memory management for it to be robust in a real-time streaming context."},{"instruction":"I no need suggestion, I need modified code to handle stream data","output":"Understood.

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how eating or consuming solid gold (24 karat) pellets, though foolish or weird, won't actually harm the person's body.","output":"In a bizarre convergence of wealth and curiosity, some individuals have taken to consuming 24 karat solid gold pellets. While the act may seem outlandish or even recklessly extravagant to the casual observer, a profound analysis reveals that, contrary to immediate assumptions, ingesting gold in this form does not inflict harm upon the human organism. This assertion is grounded in relevant scientific insights, historic uses of gold in medicine, and the intrinsic characteristics of this noble metal that ensure its harmlessness when traversed through the digestive tract of an individual. Gold, in its purest form, is chemically inert, meaning it does not react with most substances. This indifference is primarily due to its reluctance to participate in chemical reactions, a trait that stems from its electron configuration. Gold atoms possess a complete d-band and a half-filled s-band, rendering them stable and resistant to exchanging electrons with other atoms—a fundamental prerequisite for chemical reactions. When 24 karat solid gold pellets are consumed, their journey through the gastrointestinal tract is marked by an absence of chemical interaction with bodily fluids or tissues. This inert passage unequivocally demonstrates how gold, despite its foreignness to biological systems, remains unassimilated and unreactive, thereby negating potential toxicity or harm. Historically, gold has been utilized for medicinal and health-related purposes, a testament to its longstanding association with bodily contact and ingestion. Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and medieval Europeans, incorporated gold into preparations intended for internal use, believing in its healing properties and ability to purify the body. These historical precedents not only illustrate the human propensity to ingest gold but also affirm its non-toxic nature, as evidenced by the survival and continued practice of such traditions. The physical journey of gold pellets through the digestive system further illuminates the harmlessness of this practice. Once ingested, the pellets encounter various digestive processes aimed at breaking down and assimilating nutrients. However, given gold's indissolubility and inertness—the pellets essentially navigate the digestive pathway untouched. They neither dissolve nor disintegrate but instead remain whole, making their eventual exit from the body in their original form. This transit, devoid of physical or chemical alteration, underscores the innocuousness of consuming gold; the body simply acts as a temporary vessel through which the gold passes, unharmed and unchanged. Moreover, the physiological impact—or lack thereof—of gold ingestion can be clarified through a comparison with other non-toxic materials that pass through the human body without assimilation or harm. For instance, certain dietary fibers are ingested specifically for their ability to pass through the digestive system untouched, aiding in digestion and bowel health. Similarly, gold pellets perform an anatomical voyage that parallels these harmless substances, reinforcing the premise that their consumption does not perturb or endanger the bodily functions or well-being of an individual. In conclusion, while the act of consuming 24 karat solid gold pellets may strike many as eccentric or devoid of practical benefit, a meticulous analysis rooted in scientific rationality, historical usage, and an understanding of human physiology elucidates why it is an essentially harmless endeavor. Gold’s chemical inertness, combined with its historical medicinal applications and physical indissolubility during digestion, firmly establishes that ingesting it poses no threat to human health. Such an insight not only challenges prevailing perceptions about the bounds of dietary safety but also illuminates the fascinating interplay between elements of the periodic table and the human body. Through this analysis, the narrative surrounding the consumption of gold is stripped of its connotations of harm, revealing a picture of benign curiosity and the enduring allure of this timeless element."},{"instruction":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly demonstrate how just like elephants who use consume rocks to digest and break up food in their stomach to aid digestion, the used of solid gold pellets could be used by humans in the same manner for people who have trouble digesting food that is hard or difficult to break down. As the gold pellets slosh around in the stomach their movements smash against the food particles, breaking them up, thus aiding in a smoother digestion while because the gold is inert, the pellets don't react chemically with the food.","output":"Intriguingly, the concept of utilizing solid gold pellets as an aid in human digestion draws a compelling parallel to the behavioral adaptation observed in elephants. Elephants, majestic creatures of the animal kingdom, are known to intentionally consume rocks. These ingested stones serve a critical purpose within the elephants' digestive systems, helping to grind and break down tough plant materials that constitute their diet. This natural practice, evolved over millennia, highlights a fascinating example of how organisms adapt to optimize their digestive efficiency. By extending this analogy to the human use of 24 karat solid gold pellets, we delve deeper into the plausible merits of such an unconventional practice, especially for individuals facing challenges in digesting hard or complex foods. When consumed, solid gold pellets could theoretically mimic the mechanical action of gastroliths—the stones ingested by birds and some other animals, including elephants, to aid in digestion. As these gold pellets move and slosh around in the human stomach, propelled by the muscular contractions of the digestive process, they would intermittently collide with food particles. Each impact has the potential to mechanically fragment these particles, thereby reducing their size and increasing the surface area available for digestive enzymes to act upon. This mechanical breakdown could ostensibly facilitate a more efficient chemical digestion of foods that are otherwise difficult to digest, such as fibrous vegetables or tough meats, akin to the way elephants digest fibrous plant material. This analogy paints a vivid picture: as the gold pellets traverse the convoluted landscape of the human stomach, their smooth, dense surfaces come into contact with food, exerting physical force that aids in the breakdown of dietary bulk. Importantly, because gold is chemically inert, these pellets do not engage in any chemical reactions with the food or digestive juices. Their role is purely mechanical, a feature that distinguishes them from digestive enzymes or pharmaceutical aids, which chemically alter the composition of food to promote digestion. The gold pellets, therefore, offer a unique mechanism of action — a non-chemical, abrasion-based facilitation of digestion that leaves the chemical integrity of both the ingested food and the gold itself untouched. In contemplating the pragmatic use of gold pellets in this manner, several advantages emerge. First, for individuals with specific digestive insufficiencies or conditions that impair the mechanical breakdown of food, gold pellets could provide a novel form of dietary assistance, supplementing the body's own mechanical digestive processes. Second, given the inherent safety profile of gold — devoid of toxicity and resistant to corrosion within the body — these pellets offer a reusable, enduring solution. After fulfilling their function, they could, in theory, be retrieved, cleaned, and reused, presenting a sustainable alternative to consumable digestive aids. This expanded analysis invites us to reconsider the potential utility of solid gold pellets within the human digestive system. Drawing inspiration from the natural world, particularly the digestive strategies of elephants, it suggests a fascinating, if unconventional, convergence between zoology, human physiology, and the unique properties of gold. By employing solid gold pellets as mechanical aids in digestion, we uncover a novel application for this precious metal, one that leverages its physical, rather than chemical, properties to address a tangible human need. This approach not only enriches our understanding of the potential interfaces between dietary practices and material science but also lights a path toward innovative solutions for digestive health challenges, grounded in the harmonious blending of nature's wisdom with human ingenuity."},{"instruction":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how it makes no rational sense for companies to keep soliciting resumes for positions from job openings that have been filled by candidates the firm hired through recruitment process. Even on the off chance that the person in the resume the firm accepted still is open to a position in the future that doesn't mean that the person would be amenable to having his resume used as a backstop to better candidates. Most likely, the person moved on and their resume would be stale by the time the company decided to look at his now outdated resume again.","output":"The practice of companies continuously soliciting resumes for positions that have already been filled stands as a perplexing and illogical aspect of modern recruitment strategies. This enduring trend, while seemingly grounded in the desire for preparedness and the accumulation of potential candidates for future openings, fails to withstand a closer analytical examination for several cogent reasons. The core of this analysis is predicated on the inherent inefficiencies, the potential for reputational damage, and the disrespect to applicants' professional trajectories that such practices encapsulate. Firstly, the utility of maintaining a backlog of resumes for positions long since filled is significantly undermined by the dynamic nature of the job market and the individual career progression of applicants. Resumes serve as a snapshot of an applicant's skills, experiences, and qualifications at a specific point in time. As such, they quickly become outdated as individuals acquire new skills, gain further experience, or shift their career focus entirely. The assumption that a candidate whose resume was submitted for a previously filled position would remain interested, let alone suitable, for future vacancies is fundamentally flawed. In the rapidly evolving landscape of most industries, the relevancy of a candidate’s profile can diminish in a matter of months, rendering the practice of hoarding outdated resumes an exercise in futility. Secondly, from a logistical perspective, the continued solicitation of resumes for filled positions results in an unwieldy and bloated candidate database. The administrative burden of managing, categorizing, and updating such a database, not to mention ensuring its compliance with data protection regulations, can be significant. This accumulation of stale resumes not only detracts from operational efficiency but also increases the risk of overlooking or undervaluing fresh talent in favor of individuals who may no longer be viable candidates. The inefficiency of sifting through outdated information when new vacancies arise undermines the agility and responsiveness of a company's recruitment process, a critical factor in today's fast-paced job market. Moreover, the potential reputational damage that companies risk by engaging in this practice is non-trivial. In an era where candidate experience is increasingly recognized as a reflection of a company's brand, the disregard shown by soliciting applications with no intent of immediate employment can foster negative perceptions. Individuals whose resumes are collected under these premises might feel undervalued or misled, particularly if they are unaware that the role for which they applied has been filled. Word of such experiences can quickly propagate through professional networks and social media platforms, potentially deterring high-quality candidates from applying to future openings and tarnishing the company’s reputation in the job market. Finally, the ethical considerations of soliciting and retaining resumes without explicit, contemporaneous intent to review them for an open position should not be understated. Candidates prepare and submit their resumes in good faith, expecting that their applications will be considered for current vacancies. The unilateral decision by companies to use these resumes as a 'backstop' to better candidates, or to hold onto them indefinitely for potential future use, skirts the boundaries of consent and respect for the individual’s professional agency. Such practices can foster a sense of disillusionment among job seekers, who may feel that their time, effort, and personal data are being undervalued or misused. In conclusion, while the strategy of continuously soliciting and stockpiling resumes for already filled positions might superficially seem like prudent planning for future recruitment needs, a detailed analysis reveals it to be fundamentally flawed and counterproductive. This approach disregards the fluidity of career trajectories and job market dynamics, burdens companies with unnecessary administrative complications, risks significant reputational damage, and raises ethical concerns around consent and respect for candidates. A more rational and respectful approach would be for companies to focus on attracting and evaluating candidates for current, concrete opportunities, fostering a recruitment environment characterized by transparency, efficiency, and respect for the professional aspirations of all applicants."},{"instruction":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly demonstrate how persons who feel if out of the blue they get a call from a company they sent a resume to in the distant past in terms of job seeking such that the firm inquires their potential about a vacancy they might be qualified for from that outdated resume.","output":"Expanding the analysis into the realm of individual candidate experiences further elucidates the operational flaws and ethical quandaries inherent in the employment strategy of soliciting resumes for positions that have already been filled. Imagine the scenario from the perspective of a job seeker: months or even years have elapsed since they applied to a company that, unbeknownst to them, had already filled the position in question. During this interval, they have likely navigated numerous other job applications, possibly faced rejections, and ideally, grown both personally and professionally. Their career aspirations, skill sets, and perhaps even their geographical or industry preferences could have shifted significantly. When, out of the blue, they receive a call from the initial company inquiring about their interest in a new vacancy based on the outdated resume, several implications arise that further question the rationality of this recruitment approach. Firstly, it's critical to acknowledge the emotional rollercoaster such an interaction might instigate. Candidates can experience a range of emotions, from initial surprise and elation at being remembered, to confusion and skepticism about the timeliness and relevance of this resurrected interest. From a practical standpoint, the outdated resume significantly misrepresents the current capabilities and experiences of the individual. If they have progressed in their career, taken on new responsibilities, or acquired new skills, the resume the company has on file is effectively obsolete. This disconnect not only puts the candidate at a disadvantage by failing to showcase their current qualifications but also wastes both parties' time if it turns out that the individual’s career trajectory has diverged from what the company seeks. Moreover, such a belated outreach, banking on outdated information, can instill doubts in the candidate about the company’s organizational capabilities and attitudes towards human resources. A company that seems disorganized or desperate enough to dredge up old resumes rather than seeking out current candidates may not inspire confidence in its workplace culture or growth prospects. This perception is detrimental to the company’s reputation and could deter potential future applications not only from the candidate in question but also from their network, should they choose to share their experience. Additionally, consider the impact on the candidate's current professional situation. If they have since moved on to a role that aligns more closely with their career aspirations, the call from the past becomes not an opportunity but an unwanted intrusion, reminding them of a time when they were possibly more vulnerable or less certain in their career path. This unexpected resurgence of a past application could also stir unnecessary restlessness or discontent in their present role, even if they are not ultimately interested in reverting to old prospects. The scenario thus vividly illustrates how the practice of hoarding and reanimating old resumes—beyond being operationally inefficient for companies—can have profound and varied psychological and professional implications for candidates. It showcases a lack of consideration for how individuals’ professional lives evolve, potentially straining the candidate-company relationship before it even properly begins. Instead of fostering goodwill and leaving the door open for future opportunities, this approach can alienate potential talent and tarnish the company’s image in the competitive job market. In essence, it serves as a stark reminder of the need for recruitment processes to adapt dynamically to the present, acknowledging the temporal and contextual shifts that redefine both candidates' profiles and companies' needs over time."},{"instruction":"Esto es una tabla de la transformación del súper Saiyan.

Non smoker. He has recently been for tests. The 2 values that of my concern are nse 19.1 and progrp 91.1. What are normal ranges for a 67 year old male according to recent research? What do this patient's results suggest to you?","output":"Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) are both markers that can be elevated in certain conditions, particularly in neuroendocrine tumors like small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It's important to note that while these markers can provide useful information, they must be interpreted in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture, including symptoms, imaging studies, and other laboratory tests. - **Normal Ranges:** - **NSE (Neuron-Specific Enolase):** The normal range for NSE can vary slightly between different laboratories but is generally considered to be less than 16.3 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). - **ProGRP (Progastrin-Releasing Peptide):** Normal values for ProGRP are typically less than 50-60 pg/mL, although, again, the exact cutoff can depend on the assay and laboratory. - **Interpretation for the Patient:** - **NSE (19.1 ng/mL):** This patient's NSE level is slightly elevated above the typical normal range, which might indicate a neuroendocrine tumor such as small cell lung cancer, particularly in the context of additional clinical findings. However, NSE can also be elevated in non-malignant conditions and other types of cancers. - **ProGRP (91.1 pg/mL):** This level is elevated above the normal range, which raises concern for small cell lung cancer, as ProGRP is a more specific marker for this type of cancer compared to NSE. Elevated levels of ProGRP are found in the majority of patients with small cell lung cancer. Given these results and considering the patient's age and non-smoking status, it is crucial to conduct a thorough clinical and diagnostic workup, including detailed imaging and possibly a biopsy, to determine the underlying cause of these elevated tumor markers. Despite the strong association of small cell lung cancer with smoking, it can, albeit rarely, occur in non-smokers. It's also essential to consider other potential causes for elevated markers, including other neuroendocrine tumors, and to evaluate the patient's clinical symptoms and history comprehensively. It's advisable to consult with an oncologist or a specialist in the appropriate field for a detailed assessment and management plan based on the given markers and the overall clinical findings. Always remember that tumor markers are only a part of the patient's diagnosis and should not be used in isolation to make treatment decisions."},{"instruction":"I will tell you some more information about the patient...

Please carefully look at the results I have posted and ask me to clarify anything you are unsure of. for your information, some of the things in round brackets are just abbreviations.","output":"Based on the information you've provided, the patient has a comprehensive set of lab results, many of which are within normal ranges, indicating good organ function and no obvious markers for common cancers or metabolic disorders. However, there are a few results outside of the normal range that could provide insights into the patient's current health status. Your assumptions about the normal ranges are largely accurate, but they can vary slightly between different laboratories due to variations in equipment, techniques, and population differences. Let's address the abnormalities: 1. **Fasting Blood Glucose (6.61 mmol/L):** This level is slightly above the normal range, indicating impaired fasting glucose or a potential pre-diabetic state. It's important to manage this through diet, exercise, and possibly medication if it rises further. 2. **Bicarbonate (31.8 mmol/L):** This is slightly above normal and could suggest metabolic alkalosis. Possible causes include vomiting, dehydration, or diuretic use. Given the slight dehydration mentioned, this could be a related finding. 3. **Calcium (2.54 mmol/L):** This is mildly elevated and could be significant, potentially indicating hypercalcemia. Causes of hypercalcemia include hyperparathyroidism, malignancies (though your cancer markers are normal), and certain medications. Vitamin D levels and parathyroid hormone (PTH) should be checked if not already done. 4. **Cystatin C (1.09 mg/L):** This suggests slightly impaired renal function, though it's a more specific marker than creatinine. The eGFR (59.1 mL/min/1.73 m², assuming this is eGFR) also indicates mild kidney function impairment, which is an important finding in the context of overall health and requires monitoring. 5. **FFA (Free Fatty Acids) (0.70 mmol/L):** Elevated levels can indicate increased lipolysis, which might be linked to insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes, or even increased physical stress or fasting. 6. **Apolipoprotein B (apoB) (1.43 g/L):** This is elevated and is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Given the patient's high LDL levels and bradycardia, it's vital to manage this aggressively with lifestyle modifications and potentially lipid-lowering therapy. 7. **Platelet Count (353 × 10^9/L):** This is slightly above the upper limit of normal but may not be clinically significant unless it trends higher or there are symptoms suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder. 8. **Whole Blood Viscosity:** The elevated levels in low, medium, and high shear rates could indicate increased risk of thrombosis or cardiovascular issues, especially in context with high LDL levels. 9. **Free to Total PSA Ratio (0.18):** Lower ratios can indicate a higher risk of prostate cancer, though the total PSA being normal is reassuring. This should be interpreted in conjunction with digital rectal exam findings and possibly imaging if there's clinical suspicion. Regarding the eGFR of 59.1, this value suggests mild renal impairment (CKD Stage 2) and needs to be monitored over time, especially in the context of the patient's glucose and blood pressure control. Management and follow-up for this patient should include addressing the metabolic abnormalities (glucose, calcium, FFA), cardiovascular risk management (lipid control, monitoring blood viscosity and renal function), and a closer look at the prostate health due to the low free/total PSA ratio. The tiny lump near the gallbladder mentioned earlier should be evaluated in the context of these findings, possibly with further imaging and consideration for biopsy if it appears suspicious on imaging modalities. Dehydration should be addressed, and increased fluid intake recommended, especially considering its potential impact on blood viscosity and kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach involving an endocrinologist, cardiologist, nephrologist, and possibly a gastroenterologist or surgeon for the gallbladder issue would be prudent to comprehensively manage this patient's health."},{"instruction":"If you had to estimate the probability of the patient having a tumor only based on this information, what would you estimate. I completely understand the limitations of this estimate based on the lack of data, but I would appreciate your best guess","output":"Providing an accurate estimation of the probability of a tumor solely based on the information presented would be highly speculative and subject to significant error. However, I understand the need for some guidance based on available data, and I'll do my best to offer an informed perspective. Key points to consider: - **Elevated Neuroendocrine Markers:** The elevation of specific neuroendocrine markers (NSE and ProGRP) raises a suspicion of a neuroendocrine tumor such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, these markers can be elevated in other conditions as well, and their specificity can vary. - **Normal Tumor Markers:** Many common tumor markers (including alpha-fetoprotein, CEA, CA125, etc.) are within normal ranges, which could suggest that if there is a malignancy, it might not be one of the common types that these markers would identify. - **Gallbladder Lump:** The presence of a tiny lump near or in the gallbladder identified through ultrasound could be indicative of a range of conditions from benign polyps to potentially malignant tumors. Gallbladder cancer is relatively rare but could present this way. - **Overall Health and Risk Factors:** The patient's age, non-smoking status, and living in a polluted city could contribute to the risk profile for certain types of cancer. However, the lack of specific symptoms provided (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, unexplained fever) and the broader context of metabolic and potential cardiovascular issues complicate the picture. Given these factors and without more specific diagnostic imaging or biopsy results, a rough speculative estimate of the probability might be better framed in terms of risk categories (low, medium, high) rather than specific percentages. Based on the elevated neuroendocrine markers and the presence of a gallbladder lump, one might place the patient in a \\"medium\\" risk category for having a form of cancer until further diagnostic information is obtained. This classification acknowledges the abnormal findings that could be associated with malignancy but also considers the extensive normal findings and the absence (from what has been shared) of classic systemic symptoms often associated with cancer. That being said, this estimate must be taken with considerable caution. The next steps should involve a thorough diagnostic workup, including possibly a biopsy of the gallbladder lump, more specific imaging (e.g., CT or MRI scans), and perhaps PET scans to assess for any signs of malignancy. Consulting with an oncologist would be crucial to accurately determine the presence and type of any tumor. It's vital to remember this is a speculative assessment meant to guide further investigation and not a definitive diagnosis or risk assessment."},{"instruction":"If you were forced to put a percentage likelihood on 5 different types of cancer this patient may have, what would be your estimates? This is just for general interest, not for diagnosis, and will not be passed on to the patient.","output":"Given the limitations of the information provided and emphasizing that this exercise is highly speculative and not meant for clinical decision-making, I can offer some broad estimates based purely on the data shared and general knowledge of cancer epidemiology and risk factors. The absence of full clinical context, imaging results, and histopathological data makes this exercise a conjecture at best. # Potential Cancers to Consider Based on Presented Data: 1. **Gallbladder or Biliary Tract Cancer**: - **Reasoning**: The mention of a lump near the gallbladder raises suspicion. - **Estimated Likelihood**: 30% 2. **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)**: - **Reasoning**: Elevated NSE and ProGRP levels could indicate a neuroendocrine tumor, such as SCLC. However, the patient's non-smoker status reduces typical risk. - **Estimated Likelihood**: 25% 3. **Pancreatic Cancer**: - **Reasoning**: Certain neuroendocrine markers (especially NSE) might also be elevated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (although the patient's CA19-9 is reportedly normal, which would typically increase in pancreatic cancer, it's not definitive). - **Estimated Likelihood**: 15% 4. **Prostate Cancer**: - **Reasoning**: The Free to Total PSA Ratio is below the suggested normal range, indicating a higher risk, albeit the total PSA levels are within normal limits. - **Estimated Likelihood**: 15% 5. **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)**: - **Reasoning**: Mild renal function impairment indicated by cystatin C and eGFR. RCC can sometimes present with non-specific lab abnormalities. - **Estimated Likelihood**: 10% 6. **Other Considerations**: - Further diagnostic work, including imaging (MRI, CT scans) and potentially a biopsy of the gallbladder lump, is essential for any accurate diagnosis. - The percentages above are grossly speculative and based on limited information. The actual likelihood could significantly differ, and there might be benign explanations (including non-cancerous conditions) for all the findings. It's important to approach such estimates with caution and to prioritize a comprehensive diagnostic workup led by medical professionals to accurately identify the underlying cause of these lab values and physical findings."},{"instruction":"And a percentage overall for the likelihood this patient has any form of cancer?","output":"Assigning an overall percentage for the likelihood that a patient has any form of cancer without a full diagnostic workup and based only on the information provided is complex and fraught with uncertainty. However, understanding the interest in obtaining some form of speculative estimate, I'll provide a broad, general estimation. Considering the elevated tumor markers (NSE and ProGRP), the presence of a lump near the gallbladder, some lab results that are out of the normal range, and adding the context of the patient's age (67 years old), which inherently carries a higher risk for various cancers, a rough estimate might be formulated. If forced to provide an overall speculative percentage considering all data points and the general principle that there are both risk factors present (e.g., elevated tumor markers, a lump near the gallbladder) and mitigating factors (e.g., non-smoker status, many normal tumor markers), I might place the overall likelihood in the realm of: - **Estimate**: 20-40% likelihood of having some form of cancer. This range tries to encapsulate the uncertainty and the mixed indicators—both concerning and reassuring—present in the information provided. This estimate is speculative and should be approached with the understanding that the actual likelihood can only be accurately assessed through further diagnostic investigations such as more specific imaging, biopsies, and consultations with medical professionals in relevant specialties. Again, I emphasize the necessity of further diagnostic workup and professional medical consultation to explore the indications of these laboratory results and physical findings comprehensively."},{"instruction":"Other than cancers, what should the patient be most concerned about? What are the most likely health diagnoses that this patient is likely to get considering the results and information I have sent.","output":"While the discussion has focused considerably on the potential for cancer, your provided results and information also shed light on several non-cancerous conditions and risk factors that the patient should be aware of and that healthcare practitioners would likely consider. It's important to address these areas to provide a holistic approach to the patient's health. 1. **Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes Risk**: - The elevated fasting blood glucose level suggests impaired glucose handling, which places the patient at risk for prediabetes or diabetes. Incorporating lifestyle interventions and possibly medication to manage blood glucose levels would be crucial. 2. **Cardiovascular Risk**: - The high levels of Apolipoprotein B, along with the indication of high LDL cholesterol and the presence of bradycardia, point towards an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. High whole blood viscosity levels further elevate this risk by potentially increasing the risk of thrombosis. - Considering the results, management might include lipid-lowering therapies, dietary changes, increasing physical activity, and possibly aspirin prophylaxis, depending on a comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment. 3. **Renal Impairment**: - Mildly elevated Cystatin C and the mentioned eGFR suggest some degree of renal impairment. Continuous monitoring and managing blood pressure and blood sugar levels will be important to prevent further kidney damage. 4. **Electrolyte and Metabolism Considerations**: - Slightly elevated bicarbonate might point towards a metabolic alkalosis, and the slightly high calcium levels can have various causes from benign to serious, including hyperparathyroidism. Monitoring and further investigative work are needed here. 5. **Dehydration**: - This condition, which you mentioned might be a concern, can exacerbate other health issues, including impacting blood viscosity levels, renal function, and potentially contributing to the development of metabolic alkalosis. Encouraging adequate hydration is a simple yet effective management step. 6. **Prostate Health**: - While cancer was discussed, the low Free to Total PSA Ratio outside of the context of malignancy could prompt further investigation into benign prostate enlargement (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, BPH), which is common in older men and can be managed medically or surgically depending on severity and impact on quality of life. 7. **Gastrointestinal Health**: - Given the lump near the gallbladder, possibilities other than cancer include gallstones, cholecystitis, or benign tumors like adenomyomas.

Right Internal carotid artery diameter increased from 4.5mm to 5.4 mm, and its imt increased from 0.6 mm to 0.7 mm. Imt at burification increased from 0.9 mm to 1mm.","output":"The information you've provided relates to measurements taken from ultrasound imaging of the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain. Changes in the diameter of these arteries and the intima-media thickness (IMT) can be significant markers of cardiovascular health, specifically indicating the presence and progression of atherosclerosis or other vascular conditions. Here's a breakdown of what these changes might imply: 1. **Carotid Artery Diameter:** - The increase in the diameter of the right carotid artery (from 6.5 mm to 7.1 mm) and the right internal carotid artery (from 4.5 mm to 5.4 mm) could suggest vascular remodeling. This process can occur in response to various conditions, including hypertension (high blood pressure), leading to changes in the structure and function of the vessels. An increase in diameter can be a compensatory mechanism to maintain sufficient blood flow despite pathological changes within the artery. 2. **Intima-Media Thickness (IMT):** - IMT refers to the combined thickness of the intima and media layers of the artery wall. It is a recognized marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. - On the right carotid artery, the IMT decreased from 0.8 mm to 0.7 mm. Generally, a decrease in IMT might suggest an improvement or stabilization in the extent of atherosclerosis, but this interpretation can vary based on overall clinical context. - Conversely, on the right internal carotid artery, IMT increased from 0.6 mm to 0.7 mm, and at the bifurcation, IMT increased from 0.9 mm to 1 mm. Increases in IMT are typically considered indicative of progression in atherosclerotic disease or an increased cardiovascular risk. 3. **Clinical Implications:** - **Mixed Changes:** The decrease in IMT on the right carotid artery but increases on the right internal carotid artery and at the bifurcation present mixed changes. This scenario compels a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle, and potentially, the need for medical intervention to address atherosclerosis and prevent events like strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). - **Risk Assessment:** The findings underscore the importance of assessing other cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes, and family history of cardiovascular disease. 4. **Next Steps:** - These findings should prompt a discussion with a healthcare provider, ideally a cardiovascular specialist, who can interpret these changes in the context of the patient’s overall health, risk factors, and symptoms if any. Additional testing or screenings may be warranted to further evaluate the cardiovascular risk and to formulate an appropriate management or treatment plan. In summary, changes in the carotid artery diameter and IMT are important indicators of vascular health and can guide the management of cardiovascular risk factors. Given the mixed nature of the changes in IMT, a comprehensive clinical evaluation is recommended."},{"instruction":"I have some more data from this patient over the course of 3 years.

Here's a summary along with interpretations focusing on improvements, deteriorations, noticeable changes, and potential concerns. # Summary of Changes **Carotid Arteries:** - The diameter of both right and left carotid arteries has increased over the three years, indicating possible vascular remodeling. The right carotid artery's diameter increased from 6.5 mm to 7.1 mm, and the left from 6.3 mm to 7.2 mm. - IMT (Intima-media thickness), a marker for atherosclerosis, shows mixed changes. The right carotid artery IMT slightly decreased from 0.8 mm to 0.7 mm, potentially suggesting a stabilization or slight regression in plaque burden. However, the right bifurcation IMT increased (0.9 mm to 1 mm), indicating possible progression in atherosclerosis at that site. - Inner diameters have also increased, more notably in 2023. **Vertebral Arteries:** - The diameters of the vertebral arteries fluctuated but generally show a slight increase in the right vertebral artery from 3.1 mm to 3.5 mm and a decrease in the left vertebral artery from 3.9 mm to 3.6 mm. These changes might be less clinically significant but still denote some degree of remodeling. # Health Improvements - The slight decrease in the right carotid artery IMT by 2024 suggests either stabilization or a mild improvement in atherosclerotic burden. - The relatively stable diameter of the left carotid artery over the first year and the minimal changes in vertebral artery diameters might suggest a lack of significant progression in vascular disease in those regions during that period. # Health Deterioration - The increase in both right and left carotid artery diameters could suggest vascular remodeling in response to hypertension or other forms of vascular stress. - The increase in the right bifurcation IMT to 1 mm by 2024 is concerning for localized progression of atherosclerosis. # Dramatic Changes - The most noticeable changes are the increases in inner diameters of both carotid arteries detected in 2023 and the increased IMT at the right bifurcation by 2024. # Primary Concerns 1. **Progression of Atherosclerosis:** The increase in IMT, especially at the bifurcation, is concerning and suggests that atherosclerosis is still actively developing in that region. 2. **Vascular Remodeling:** The increasing diameters of the carotid arteries could indicate compensatory changes due to increased blood pressure or flow, which might reflect underlying hypertension or other cardiovascular risk factors needing management. 3. **Potential for Clinical Events:** Progression in carotid artery atherosclerosis increases the risk of cerebrovascular events, such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. The primary concern would be ensuring that the progression of atherosclerosis is managed effectively to mitigate these risks. # Recommendations for Care - **Risk Factor Management:** Rigorous control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and cessation of smoking (if applicable) are crucial. - **Follow-Up Imaging:** Regular monitoring with ultrasound imaging to detect further changes in arterial health and atherosclerotic progression. - **Consultation with a Specialist:** A vascular surgeon or a cardiologist specializing in cerebrovascular disease could provide targeted management strategies and interventions to minimize risk. In conclusion, while there are signs of possible vascular health stabilization in some areas, the overall picture indicates a progression of atherosclerosis, especially at the carotid bifurcation, and vascular remodeling.

(I understand the limitations and that you are not the doctor). If so, please list the most likely prescription medications, along with any data about each medication's effectiveness, and potential side effects and risks.","output":"Given the information and the general trends in the management of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors, a cardiologist might consider recommending medication as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. It's important to keep in mind that any medication decision will be based on a detailed personal and family medical history, current health status, and a thorough risk assessment. Here are some common categories of medications that could potentially be recommended, along with their effectiveness, and common side effects and risks: # 1. Statins - **Purpose:** Lower LDL cholesterol (\\"bad\\" cholesterol) levels, which can help reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Statins are a key part of managing atherosclerosis. - **Effectiveness:** Statins have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events by about 25% for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. - **Common Side Effects:** Muscle pain, increased risk of diabetes, liver enzyme elevation. - **Examples:** Atorvastatin, Simvastatin. # 2. Antihypertensives - **Purpose:** Lower high blood pressure, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and can exacerbate atherosclerosis. - **Effectiveness:** Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of stroke by 35-40%, heart attack by 20-25%, and heart failure by more than 50%. - **Common Side Effects:** Depending on the specific medication, side effects can include fatigue, dizziness, and electrolyte imbalances. - **Examples:** ACE inhibitors (e.g., Lisinopril), Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (e.g., Losartan), Calcium channel blockers (e.g., Amlodipine). # 3. Antiplatelet Agents - **Purpose:** Prevent the formation of blood clots, which can reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack. - **Effectiveness:** Can reduce the risk of stroke by 15-20% in patients with atherosclerosis. - **Common Side Effects:** Increased bleeding risk, gastrointestinal upset. - **Examples:** Aspirin, Clopidogrel. # 4. Anticoagulants - **Purpose:** Similar to antiplatelet agents but work through a different mechanism to prevent clot formation. - **Effectiveness:** Effective in preventing strokes, especially in patients with conditions like atrial fibrillation. - **Common Side Effects:** Bleeding risks are a primary concern. - **Examples:** Warfarin, Apixaban, Rivaroxaban. # 5. Beta-blockers - **Purpose:** Lower blood pressure and heart rate, reducing the heart's workload and improving survival after heart attacks. - **Effectiveness:** Can reduce cardiovascular mortality and the risk of secondary cardiovascular events. - **Common Side Effects:** Fatigue, cold extremities, sleep disturbances, and erectile dysfunction. - **Examples:** Metoprolol, Atenolol. # Note: The choice of medication, combination therapy, dosage, and management plan will be highly individualized, considering the patient’s specific condition, risk factors, and potential for side effects. It's essential for patients to discuss the benefits, risks, and alternatives with their cardiologist to make an informed decision that aligns with their health goals and preferences. Regular monitoring for effectiveness and side effects will be an integral part of managing the treatment plan."},{"instruction":"Please summarise and critique dr aseem malhotra's views about statins","output":"Dr. Aseem Malhotra is a cardiologist and a vocal critic of the widespread use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. His views and criticisms mainly revolve around concerns about the efficacy of statins in individuals without pre-existing heart disease, the potential side effects associated with statin usage, and broader issues regarding conflict of interest within medical research and guideline formulation. Below is a summary of his viewpoints, followed by a critique based on the broader medical and research community perspectives. # Summary of Dr. Malhotra's Views on Statins: 1. **Questioning Efficacy:** Malhotra has argued that the benefits of statins for primary prevention (in patients without established cardiovascular disease) are overestimated. He points to data suggesting that statins offer minimal reduction in overall mortality risk for these individuals. 2. **Highlighting Side Effects:** He emphasizes the potential side effects of statin therapy, which can include muscle pains and weakness, increased risk of diabetes, and cognitive impairment. Malhotra suggests that these side effects are underreported and may impact the quality of life significantly. 3. **Conflict of Interest:** Malhotra has critiqued the pharmaceutical industry's influence on medical research, guidelines, and prescribing behaviors. He calls for more transparency and independent research to guide clinical recommendations. 4. **Lifestyle Over Medication:** He advocates for a greater focus on lifestyle interventions, including diet and exercise, as more effective and safer strategies for reducing cardiovascular risk compared to widespread statin use. # Critique: 1. **Efficacy Evidence:** The efficacy of statins, especially in secondary prevention (for those with established cardiovascular disease), is well-documented and supported by a vast body of evidence. For primary prevention, guidelines typically recommend statins based on an individual's overall risk profile, with many trials showing a benefit in reducing cardiovascular events. 2. **Side Effects Consideration:** While acknowledging the existence of side effects is essential, large-scale studies and meta-analyses have generally found that serious adverse effects from statins are rare. The perceived prevalence of side effects may be influenced by factors like the nocebo effect, where expecting negative outcomes increases the likelihood of experiencing them. 3. **Addressing Conflicts of Interest:** While the concern about conflicts of interest in medicine is valid and important, it does not inherently invalidate the extensive research supporting statin use. Efforts are continually made within the scientific community to increase transparency and reduce biases. 4. **Role of Lifestyle Modifications:** There is a consensus that lifestyle changes are critical for managing cardiovascular risk. However, in many cases, lifestyle modifications alone may not be enough to reduce risk adequately, and medication like statins can provide an additional benefit. In conclusion, Dr. Malhotra's critique of statins contributes to the discussion and highlights the importance of considering benefits and risks in the context of individual patient situations. It also underlines the necessity of lifestyle interventions as a foundational approach to cardiovascular risk reduction. However, the broader medical community supports the use of statins, where indicated, as part of a comprehensive strategy for managing cardiovascular risk, informed by a large body of evidence supporting their efficacy and safety profile. Continuing research, debate, and discussion in this area are vital to refining guidelines and recommendations for statin use."},{"instruction":"Are there any reasons why the medications you mentioned might be unsuitable for this patient just taking into account the data I have provided","output":"Based on the data you've provided, which includes observations of changing carotid and vertebral artery measurements over time and a context focused on vascular health, certain considerations might influence the suitability of the mentioned medications for this specific patient. It’s crucial to underline, however, that the absolute suitability of any medication can only be effectively assessed by a healthcare professional, taking into account the full medical history, current health status, other ongoing treatments, and individual risk factors. Here are potential considerations or reasons why some medications might be approached with caution: # Statins - **Muscle Symptoms:** Given that statins can cause muscle pain or weakness, which might deter physical activity, their prescription would need careful consideration if the patient already experiences such symptoms. - **Diabetes Risk:** Statins have been linked to a slightly increased risk of developing diabetes. If the patient is already in a prediabetic state or has significant risk factors for diabetes, this might warrant a more nuanced discussion about the risk-benefit balance. # Antihypertensives - **Hypotension Risk:** If the patient has borderline or low blood pressure readings, certain antihypertensive medications could further lower blood pressure, posing risks of hypotension. # Antiplatelet Agents - **Bleeding Risk:** As antiplatelet agents increase bleeding risk, they might not be suitable for patients with a history of bleeding disorders, those on other medications that increase bleeding risk, or those undergoing surgeries. # Anticoagulants - **High Bleeding Risk:** Similar to antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants carry a risk of significant bleeding. They may be unsuitable for patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure (which can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke), a history of bleeding, or specific types of stroke. # Beta-blockers - **Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** Beta-blockers can exacerbate asthma or COPD; thus, they may need to be avoided in patients with these conditions. - **Bradycardia:** If the patient already experiences bradycardia, beta-blockers could further slow down the heart rate, potentially to problematic levels. Given that the specific details about existing conditions or comorbidities weren't provided, the above considerations are speculative and generic. Any decision regarding medication would need a comprehensive evaluation, including the current vascular changes observed, the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile, tolerability, and personal preferences. The evolving nature of the patient’s vascular health signals a requirement for tailored management, where potential medication benefits are carefully weighed against the risks and side effects in collaboration with healthcare providers."},{"instruction":"Are there any specific medications in that list he should avoid? If yes tell me his medical condition that makes you think it might not be appropriate for him","output":"Based on the previously provided information about the patient, there are no explicit details about specific comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart rate issues (e.g., bradycardia), bleeding disorders, liver or kidney impairments, or asthma/COPD that would directly influence the appropriateness of the mentioned medications. Without details on these or other health conditions, it's challenging to definitively say which specific medications should be avoided. However, considering the focus on vascular health and the changes in carotid and vertebral artery measurements: 1. **If the patient has a history of or is at high risk for bleeding disorders**, medications that increase bleeding risk (such as **antiplatelet agents** or **anticoagulants**) would need to be used cautiously. The decision to prescribe these would depend on a careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio by a healthcare provider. 2. **For a patient with documented bradycardia** (if this were known), **beta-blockers**, which can further slow heart rate, might be approached with caution unless the therapeutic benefits outweigh the risks, and the condition being treated is serious enough to warrant their use despite potential exacerbation of bradycardia. 3. **In the case of pre-existing liver or kidney disease** (if present, though not specified), certain medications might require dose adjustments or might be contraindicated due to how they are metabolized or excreted. For example, **statins** are primarily metabolized by the liver, and certain types can pose risks in the context of liver dysfunction. 4. **Should the patient have a predisposition to or existing diabetes**, the potential of **statins** to modestly increase blood sugar levels might be a consideration, though the cardiovascular benefits of statins often outweigh this risk for most patients. Without specific medical conditions explicitly mentioned in your previous information beyond the vascular changes observed, these considerations remain hypothetical. Any medication regimen needs to be carefully personalized, considering all aspects of the patient's health, potential interactions with other medications, and the overall risk-benefit analysis specific to the patient's clinical scenario. Given the importance of managing vascular health to prevent cardiovascular events, any medication decisions would focus on optimizing this outcome while minimizing potential adverse effects. It's crucial for these decisions to be made in direct consultation with healthcare providers who have a complete picture of the patient's health status."},{"instruction":"I told you earlier that he suffers from bradycardia and has high ldl. Do you not remember?","output":"I appreciate your patience and the reminder. Given the specific context including bradycardia and high LDL levels, let's reassess the considerations for the patient's medication options: # Bradycardia This condition, characterized by a slower than normal heart rate, can influence the choice of certain cardiovascular medications: 1. **Beta-Blockers:** These are typically used to manage hypertension, heart failure, and prevent heart attacks. However, they can exacerbate bradycardia by further slowing the heart rate. In patients with bradycardia, beta-blockers should be used with caution, closely monitored, or possibly avoided depending on the severity of the bradycardia and the clinical judgment of the healthcare provider. 2. **Calcium Channel Blockers (such as Diltiazem and Verapamil):** Similar to beta-blockers, certain calcium channel blockers can also reduce heart rate and might be contraindicated in patients with significant bradycardia. # High LDL For managing high levels of LDL cholesterol (often referred to as \\"bad\\" cholesterol), statins are the cornerstone: 1. **Statins:** These are effective in lowering LDL cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Given the patient's high LDL levels, statins would likely be recommended unless contraindicated for another reason. It's essential to monitor for potential side effects, including muscle symptoms and the rare risk of increased blood sugar levels. People with high LDL and evidence of atherosclerosis (as may be suggested by changes in carotid artery measurements) generally benefit significantly from statin therapy. Given the patient's conditions: - The primary concern with statins, which are indicated for high LDL, is the careful monitoring of side effects, rather than a direct interaction with bradycardia. Statins could be considered beneficial for this patient, focusing on cardiovascular risk reduction. - With bradycardia, careful consideration of beta-blockers and certain calcium channel blockers would be necessary, balancing the benefits of controlling blood pressure and reducing heart workload against the potential risk of exacerbating bradycardia. For someone with both bradycardia and high LDL, a comprehensive approach that involves lifestyle changes, possibly augmented with statin therapy for LDL management, and a cautious evaluation of other heart rate-lowering medications for other cardiovascular needs, would be recommended. Close monitoring by a healthcare provider, with adjustments as needed based on the patient's response to therapy and any emerging side effects, would be crucial."},{"instruction":"Do you remember his age? His nse and progrp results?","output":"Yes, based on the initial details you provided: - The patient is **67 years old**. - The patient's test results were as follows: - **NSE (Neuron-Specific Enolase):** 19.1 ng/mL - **ProGRP (Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide):** 91.1 pg/mL Given these results and the patient's age: 1. **Age (67 years old):** At this age, the patient is considered to be at a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases and possibly other conditions such as certain types of cancer. The management of his health conditions, including the use of medications, would need to take his age into consideration due to potential age-related changes in drug metabolism and sensitivity, as well as the presence of comorbidities. 2. **Elevated NSE and ProGRP:** These elevated markers may indicate the presence of neuroendocrine tumors, such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which require thorough investigation and specialist referral. While these markers are more directly relevant to oncological evaluation and management, understanding the full scope of the patient's health, including the presence of any tumors, is crucial for comprehensive cardiovascular management, especially if cancer treatment may impact cardiovascular health. In light of his specific age, elevated tumor markers, presence of bradycardia, and high LDL levels, a collaborative approach involving oncology (due to the tumor markers), cardiology (for cardiovascular risk management, including attention to bradycardia and high LDL), and potentially other specialists will be essential for optimizing his health outcomes."},{"instruction":"Is it fair to conclude the decreasing of imt is a positive sign of improved vascular health in some aspects, despite the widening of arteries which needs managed primarily by blood pressure controlling?","output":"Yes, your conclusion captures two important aspects of vascular health monitoring through changes in carotid artery characteristics: 1. **Decreasing IMT (Intima-Media Thickness):** A reduction in IMT can indeed be interpreted as a positive sign in the context of vascular health. The IMT is a measurement used to gauge the thickness of the carotid artery's walls and is considered an indicator of atherosclerosis. A decrease in IMT over time could suggest a stabilization or regression of atherosclerotic plaque, which translates to a reduced risk for cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. This improvement could be the result of various factors, including lifestyle modifications, statin therapy, or better control of cardiovascular risk factors like hyperlipidemia. 2. **Widening of Arteries:** The dilation or increase in the diameter of the carotid arteries can be a more complex sign. Vascular remodeling, or changes in the size and structure of blood vessels, can occur in response to several factors, including hypertension (high blood pressure). Arterial dilatation might reflect adaptive responses to increased blood flow demands or compensatory mechanisms to preserve flow in the presence of arterial stiffening or atherosclerosis. However, in certain contexts, arterial widening can also indicate underlying pathology, such as an aneurysm formation, which would require careful evaluation. Given these changes: - **Management of Blood Pressure:** Controlling blood pressure is a cornerstone in managing vascular health, particularly for patients showing signs of vascular remodeling or dilation. Hypertension is a well-known risk factor for the progression of atherosclerosis and related complications. Effective blood pressure control can help mitigate the risks associated with widened arteries and reduce the overall cardiovascular risk. In summary, the observed decrease in IMT can indeed be seen as a favorable indicator of improving or stable vascular health in specific contexts, reflecting the beneficial outcomes of managing atherosclerotic disease. However, the widening of arteries, particularly if driven by hypertension, underscores the importance of vigilant blood pressure management as part of a comprehensive approach to cardiovascular health. These vascular changes highlight the need for ongoing monitoring and an integrated management strategy that addresses all modifiable risk factors, including lipid levels, blood pressure, smoking status, diabetes control, and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity. Collaboration between the patient and a multidisciplinary healthcare team is essential to tailor interventions that best suit the patient's unique health status and risk profile."},{"instruction":"Given Table schema – session id, post id, time_stamp, event_type, percentage. The event type includes start time and end time Build Sql - Find out whether the post in this session (each post will correspond to several start and end times) is valid to read (threshold is 5 seconds and 80% of the screen proportion are valid to read)","output":"To address this query, we should first understand what constitutes a \\"valid to read\\" post based on the given criteria: 1. The difference between the start time and end time of the post reading session should be at least 5 seconds. 2. The percentage of the screen proportion during the reading session should be at least 80%. Having clarified the conditions, we can approach this query step by step. We'll assume that the \`event_type\` can differentiate between \\"start\\" and \\"end\\" events (let's say, 'start' for session start and 'end' for session end), and that the \`percentage\` column represents the screen proportion occupied by the post. Since SQL doesn't directly allow us to compare rows (to calculate the time difference between start and end times within each session), we may need to use self-joins or window functions, depending on the capabilities of the SQL engine in use. This example uses generic SQL with window functions, which are supported by many modern SQL databases: \`\`\`sql SELECT DISTINCT a.session_id, a.post_id FROM (SELECT *, LEAD(time_stamp) OVER(PARTITION BY session_id, post_id ORDER BY time_stamp) AS next_time_stamp, LEAD(event_type) OVER(PARTITION BY session_id, post_id ORDER BY time_stamp) AS next_event_type, LEAD(percentage) OVER(PARTITION BY session_id, post_id ORDER BY time_stamp) AS next_percentage FROM your_table_name WHERE event_type = 'start' ) a WHERE a.next_event_type = 'end' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, a.time_stamp, a.next_time_stamp) >= 5 -- Assuming you're using a SQL version that supports TIMESTAMPDIFF, adjust based on your SQL dialect AND a.percentage >= 80 AND a.next_percentage >= 80; \`\`\` **Explanation**: - We use a subquery (\`a\`) with window functions to calculate the \`next_time_stamp\`, \`next_event_type\`, and \`next_percentage\` for each row. This aligns the \`start\` and \`end\` events, assuming that each \`start\` event is directly followed by its corresponding \`end\` event. - The \`PARTITION BY\` clause ensures that these calculations are done within groups of the same \`session_id\` and \`post_id\`. - The conditions in the \`WHERE\` clause of the outer query make sure that: - We only consider rows where the \`next_event_type\` is 'end', ensuring we're looking at complete sessions. - The difference between \`time_stamp\` (start time) and \`next_time_stamp\` (end time) is at least 5 seconds. - The \`percentage\` at the start and end (\`next_percentage\`) is at least 80%. - We use \`DISTINCT\` to ensure the unique combinations of \`session_id\` and \`post_id\` because our analysis could theoretically surface the same post-session pair more than once if our data or initial assumptions did not perfectly align. Keep in mind, you may need to adjust the query to fit your database's specific SQL dialect and functions. Also, always validate the approach with some test data to ensure it behaves as expected, especially considering potential edge cases within your dataset."},{"instruction":"This is a follow-up question with above, use Python to answer - Turns the above into realtime streaming process, but with a session end signal at the end of each session. the stream data will have late arrived data, you need handle this situation.","output":"Handling a real-time streaming process with late-arriving data for the given scenario in Python requires a structured approach. For this solution, I'll introduce a framework using Apache Kafka for streaming, Faust for stream processing which is similar to Kafka Streams but for Python, and assuming a data storage mechanism to deal with state (e.g., sessions' start times, end times, and percentages). This high-level setup involves: 1. **Apache Kafka** for managing the stream of data (session start and end events with timestamps, percentage, etc.). 2. **Faust** for processing the stream in real-time, handling session aggregation, and dealing with late-arriving data. 3. **A Data Store** (could be Redis, PostgreSQL, or any fast datastore capable of handling updates) for maintaining state about each session's start and end events, to compute valid sessions based on the arrival of an end signal and late data adjustments. # Step 1: Set Up Kafka Topic You'll need a topic, say, \`post_events\`, where you publish your session events. Each event might look like: \`\`\` { 'session_id': 'xyz', 'post_id': 'abc', 'time_stamp': '2023-04-05T14:20:30', 'event_type': 'start', # Or 'end' 'percentage': 85 } \`\`\` # Step 2: Faust Stream Processing First, install Faust: \`\`\`bash pip install faust \`\`\` Then, create a Faust app: \`\`\`python import faust # Define the model/schema of your events class PostEvent(faust.Record, serializer='json'): session_id: str post_id: str time_stamp: str event_type: str percentage: int app = faust.App('post_sessions_processor', broker='kafka://localhost:9092') topic = app.topic('post_events', value_type=PostEvent) # Define an async table (like a dictionary but asynchronous and can be shared across workers) # This table could potentially be persistent sessions_table = app.Table('sessions', default=dict) @app.agent(topic) async def process(events): async for event in events: # Handle your event (assuming you transform time_stamp into a Python datetime object) # Check if it's a start or end, and update \`sessions_table\` accordingly # Ensure to handle late-arriving data by checking timestamps pass # Your logic goes here if __name__ == '__main__': app.main() \`\`\` # Step 3: Handling Start, End, and Late Data Within your \`process\` function, you need to implement logic that: 1. Handles incoming \`start\` and \`end\` events, updating \`sessions_table\` with their details. 2. For every end event, checks if the session is valid (based on 5-second duration and 80% view). 3. Periodically reviews sessions to adjust based on late-arriving data. This could involve checking the time difference between events in the stored session information and determining if a scenario’s criteria for a readable session are met or need adjustment. # Handling Late Data Handling late data is challenging and requires establishing a threshold for how late data can be before it's ignored. One strategy is windowing (using processing time windowing), where you periodically check for updates in past windows and adjust them as necessary. In our case, this could mean adjusting the validity of sessions if late data impacts the duration or percentage conditions adversely. This is a broad outline of creating a streaming data process for real criteria checks on session data. The specifics would need to be tailored to your exact requirements, including how to manage state and maintain performance under varying loads."},{"instruction":"No Kafka allowed, python only","output":"Without using Kafka or any other external queue/streaming system, you can simulate a real-time streaming process in Python by collecting incoming data streams (via sockets, HTTP requests, or simply reading from a file in a loop) and processing them as they arrive. To deal with out-of-order (late) data, you need to maintain a buffer or window of data that you're willing to keep open for updates before finalizing a session's \\"valid to read\\" status. Here's a simplified approach using Python's asyncio for asynchronous processing, assuming data comes in as a stream of JSON-like dictionaries from some source (\`async_data_source()\`), and we simulate late data handling by keeping sessions open for a certain \`late_window\` period. # Python-Only Approach with Asynchronous Processing \`\`\`python import asyncio from datetime import datetime, timedelta # Example incoming data format example_data = [ {\\"session_id\\": \\"1\\", \\"post_id\\": \\"101\\", \\"time_stamp\\": \\"2023-04-01T12:30:00\\", \\"event_type\\": \\"start\\", \\"percentage\\": 85}, # Imagine more events, including late arrivals and end events ] # Assuming this simulates your incoming data stream async def async_data_source(): for data in example_data: await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simulate delay between data arrivals yield data # Parser for the time_stamp strings def parse_time_stamp(time_stamp): return datetime.strptime(time_stamp, \\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\\") # Process each event async def process_event(event, sessions): session_id = event[\\"session_id\\"] event_type = event[\\"event_type\\"] time_stamp = parse_time_stamp(event[\\"time_stamp\\"]) percentage = event[\\"percentage\\"] # Check if this is the first time we see this session_id if session_id not in sessions: sessions[session_id] = {\\"start\\": None, \\"end\\": None, \\"percentages\\": []} # Update session data based on event type if event_type == \\"start\\": sessions[session_id][\\"start\\"] = time_stamp elif event_type == \\"end\\": sessions[session_id][\\"end\\"] = time_stamp # Assume percentage is relevant for both start and end sessions[session_id][\\"percentages\\"].append(percentage) # Check if the session can be closed (conditions met and enough time passed) await check_and_finalize_session(session_id, sessions) # Check and finalize sessions that are complete and valid async def check_and_finalize_session(session_id, sessions, late_window=timedelta(seconds=10)): session = sessions[session_id] now = datetime.now() if session[\\"start\\"] and session[\\"end\\"] and min(session[\\"percentages\\"]) >= 80: duration = session[\\"end\\"] - session[\\"start\\"] # Conditions: Duration at least 5 seconds, percentage >= 80, and either not late or grace period passed if duration >= timedelta(seconds=5) and (now - session[\\"end\\"] > late_window): print(f\\"Session {session_id} is valid and closed.\\") del sessions[session_id] # Remove it from active sessions # Main async processing loop async def main(): sessions = {} async for event in async_data_source(): await process_event(event, sessions) # Run the async main loop asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` **Key Components Explained**: - \`async_data_source()\`: Simulates an asynchronous stream of data. Replace this with your actual data source, e.g., reading from a file in real-time or receiving data over the network. - \`process_event()\`: Processes incoming events by updating session information or creating new session entries as needed. - \`check_and_finalize_session()\`: After each event, checks if the session can be considered complete and valid, based on your criteria (duration and screen proportion). It keeps a \\"late window\\" to account for potential late data affecting the session validity. # Handling Late-Arriving Data: To efficiently manage late-arriving data, this setup includes a late window (\`late_window\` in \`check_and_finalize_session()\`) which dictates how long to wait after the last known event in a session before finalizing its status. Adjust this window based on your expected latency and tolerance for late data. Keep in mind, this is a simplified example. In a production environment, you'd need to handle more complexities, such as error handling, efficient state storage (e.g., using an in-memory database if the volume of sessions is large), and scaling the solution."},{"instruction":"Hi There","output":"Hello!

The task involves comparing each row with every other row to check for repeated 'Assembly Name' values but with different 'Assembly Accession' codes. When such cases are found, the 'Assembly Accession' from the second row should be appended as a new column in the first row, and then the second row is dropped. Here's how you could do it: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame # Let's first define a function that will process the DataFrame according to the rules specified def process_repeated_names(df): # Creating a new column to store the repeated Assembly Accession codes df['Repeated Assembly Accession'] = None # Convert Assembly Name column to ensure it's a string (to avoid any unexpected errors) df['Assembly Name'] = df['Assembly Name'].astype(str) # Creating a temporary copy of the dataframe to iterate over. # This is important because we'll be modifying the original dataframe. temp_df = df.copy() for index, row in temp_df.iterrows(): assembly_name = row['Assembly Name'] # Fetching all rows with the same Assembly Name but different Assembly Accession repeats = df[(df['Assembly Name'] == assembly_name) & (df['Assembly Accession'] != row['Assembly Accession'])] if not repeats.empty: # If there are repeated names with different accessions, append them as new entries in the 'Repeated Assembly Accession' column of the original row for r_index, r_row in repeats.iterrows(): if pd.isnull(df.at[index, 'Repeated Assembly Accession']): df.at[index, 'Repeated Assembly Accession'] = r_row['Assembly Accession'] else: df.at[index, 'Repeated Assembly Accession'] += ', ' + r_row['Assembly Accession'] # Drop the repeated row df.drop(r_index, inplace=True) # Resetting index after dropping rows df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True) return df # Applying the function to your dataframe processed_df = process_repeated_names(df) print(processed_df) \`\`\` This script defines a function \`process_repeated_names\` that iterates over each row in the DataFrame. For each row, it finds all other rows with the same 'Assembly Name' but different 'Assembly Accession'.

After processing, it returns the modified DataFrame with the structure you described.
