Each guest needs to leave by wearing any pair of kaloshes that fit them, which means each guest can only wear kaloshes of their size or larger. At some moment, remaining guests find no kaloshes fitting their feet. 2. **Guests and Kaloshes Numbering**:    - Number the guests and kaloshes from 1 to 10 in ascending order of size.     - Guest (i) has kaloshes size (i). 3. **Maximal Scenario Proof**:    - Suppose there are more than 5 guests left. Specifically, let's assume 6 guests remain.    - Since any remaining guest ((6, 7, 8, 9, 10)) can only take kaloshes of size ((6, 7, 8, 9, 10)), the smallest remaining guest (6) can fit the largest remaining kaloshes because sizes are unique and sequential. 4. **Contradiction**:    - This leads to a contradiction: if 6 guests remain, the guest with the smallest feet of those remaining (number 6) could always find fitting kaloshes (the largest size among (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)). Hence, it's impossible for more than 5 guests to be left without any kaloshes fitting them. 5. **Possible Remaining Guests**:    - If exactly 5 guests have already left, the sizes of the remaining kaloshes would be ((1, 2, 3, 4, 5)).    - If guests numbered (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) leave first with kaloshes numbered (10, 9, 8, 7, 6), none of the remaining guests (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) can wear kaloshes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) (since their feet size is larger). # Conclusion: - In the outlined scenario, the maximum number of guests left unable to find any fit kaloshes is 5.

We will construct an Eulerian circuit on the complete graph K_p with p vertices that does not contain any cycles of length at most 2023. 1. **Identify a Generator**:     - Consider a generator ( g mod p ) for the multiplicative group of integers modulo ( p ). This means ( g ) is a primitive root modulo ( p ), and the powers of ( g ) will produce all nonzero residues modulo ( p ).     - We choose ( g ) such that ( g ) is not equivalent to any fraction of the form (frac{-a}{b}) for integers ( a, b leq 2023 ). This ensures that ( g ) does not solve the equation ( c cdot g^{i+1} equiv (p - d) cdot g^i mod p ) for ( c + d leq 2023 ). For sufficiently large primes ( p ), such a ( g ) exists because the number of problematic fractions is finite, and large primes have many primitive roots. 2. **Labeling Vertices**:     - Number the vertices of the complete graph ( K_p ) using the residues modulo ( p ).

Then, this cycle would involve an overlap from the end of one sequence to the start of another, requiring the equation ( c cdot g^{i+1} equiv (p - d) cdot g^i mod p ) to hold, where ( c + d leq 2023 ).     - By our choice of ( g ), such an equation cannot hold, which implies no cycle of length ( leq 2023 ) can exist. _Final Conclusion:_ Therefore, the Eulerian circuit constructed does not contain any cycles of length at most 2023, confirming that such an Eulerian circuit exists for sufficiently large primes ( p ).

The inequality x[f(x)-f(-x)] < 0 can be simplified to 2xf(x) < 0, which means xf(x) < 0,   Therefore, when x < 0, we get f(x) > 0=f(-1), hence x > -1, which means -1 < x < 0;   When x > 0, we get f(x) < 0=f(1), hence x < 1, which means 0 < x < 1.   In summary, the solution set of the inequality x[f(x)-f(-x)] < 0 is {x|-1 < x < 0, or 0 < x < 1}.   Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"instruction":"Antoinette weighs 7 less kilograms than a certain multiple of Rupert's weight. Together they weigh 98 kilograms. Antoinette weighs 63 kilograms. What is the ratio of Antoinette's weight to Rupert's weight?","output":"Let's denote Rupert's weight as R and Antoinette's weight as A. We are given that A = 63 kilograms. We are also told that Antoinette weighs 7 kilograms less than a certain multiple of Rupert's weight. This can be written as: A = kR - 7, where k is the multiple. Since we know A = 63, we can substitute that into the equation: 63 = kR - 7 Now, we need to find the value of kR, which is the certain multiple of Rupert's weight that is 7 kilograms more than Antoinette's weight: kR = 63 + 7 kR = 70 Together, Antoinette and Rupert weigh 98 kilograms: A + R = 98 63 + R = 98 R = 98 - 63 R = 35 kilograms Now we have Rupert's weight, R = 35 kilograms, and we know that kR = 70 kilograms. To find the multiple k, we divide kR by R: k = kR / R k = 70 / 35 k = 2 So, Antoinette weighs 7 kilograms less than twice Rupert's weight. Finally, to find the ratio of Antoinette's weight to Rupert's weight: Ratio (A:R) = A / R Ratio (A:R) = 63 / 35 Ratio (A:R) = 9 / 5 (after simplifying the fraction) Therefore, the ratio of Antoinette's weight to Rupert's weight is boxed{9:5} ."},{"instruction":"a convex quadrilateral ABCD, AB = 20 with AB being the longest side, overline{AB} parallel overline{CD}.

With given angle B = 120^circ, it follows that angle A + angle C = 60^circ. 2. **Relate the sides and the condition on perimeters**: The perimeter of ABC is 20 + a + b. For triangle BCD, since D will mirror properties of A against BC, CD parallel AB causes CD = AB = 20. Thus perimeter of BCD is similarly 20 + b + c. Quadrilateral ABCD then has perimeter 20 + a + b + 20 + c = 40 + a + b + c. 3. **Set up the progression**:    - First, let 20 + a + b = x, 20 + b + c = xr, and 40 + a + b + c = xr^2.    - Using these, solve for r, a, and c:      - From 20 + b + c = xr and 40 + a + b + c = xr^2, solve the equations to find representations for a and c in terms of x and r:      [      a + c = x(r^2 - r) - 20      ]      - Since a + c = 60^circ - angle B, use cosine rule to further restrict these values. 4. **Check solutions and the various values of b**:    - Cases with a = 20, b = 20r - 20, leads to values of c = xr - 20r which must be non-negative and create viable triangles.    - For the simplification, analyze feasible r values and solve for b each time, ensuring angle A + angle C = 60^circ holds.    - A sum based on these feasible perimeter conditions.

To demonstrate that the entire number is divisible by 239, consider the indicated fact: “The number ( 10^7 - 1 ) is divisible by 239.” 1. **Understanding the Prompt:**    The referenced fact is fundamental. It means that if we can show each seven-digit block in our large number contributes zero remainder when divided by 239, the entire concatenated number also divides by 239 without remainder. 2. **Expressing the Divisibility Property:**    Given a number ( n ), if ( n = k cdot (10^7 - 1) ) for some integer ( k ), then ( n ) is divisible by 239 because ( 10^7 - 1 ) is divisible by 239. 3. **Breaking Down ( 10^7 - 1 ):**    [    10^7 - 1 = 10000000 - 1 = 9999999    ]    Since it is given that 9999999 is divisible by 239, we use this property in our solution. 4. **Using the Property Across Concatenation:**    When we concatenate the sequences, let’s say k times, we are essentially forming the number:    [    N = a cdot 10^{7m} + b cdot 10^{7(m-1)} + cdots + z cdot 10^0    ]    where ( a, b, ldots, z ) are the seven-digit blocks making up the entire number ( N ), and ( m ) is the number of blocks. 5. **Key Insight from Modulo Arithmetic:**    Modular arithmetic tells us that if ( 10^7 equiv 1 pmod{239} ) (because ( 10^7 - 1 ) is divisible by 239), then:    [    forall k quad 10^{7k} equiv 1^k equiv 1 pmod{239}    ]    This means every exponentiated term modular reduction (relative to 239) cycles back to itself. 6. **Simplifying the Number ( N ):**    Given our sequence, the entire number structure periodically resets modulo 239 to ( z + cdots + b + a ). This simplification directly results in:    [    N equiv a + b + cdots + z quad pmod{239}    ]    Since all these components divided/padded correctly collapse into a sequence sum divisible by 239 inherently from the problem's structure setup. Thus, the final concatenated number entirely composed through periodic resets remains divisible by 239 since ( 10^7 - 1 ) ensures each block reinitiates a valid division circle modulo. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The large concatenated number is divisible by 239.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Two trains start at the same time from two stations and proceed towards each other at the rate of 20 km/hr and another speed respectively.

Equality holds when x = y, thus in our case, the equality holds when:  frac{2a}{b} = frac{2b}{a}   a^2 = b^2   a = b  Substituting a = b into the equation a + 2b = 1 gives 3b = 1; hence, b = frac{1}{3} and a = frac{1}{3}. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression frac{1}{a} + frac{2}{b} is in fact 5, which occurs when a = b = frac{1}{3}.

Denote the positions of the three trees chosen to hang the small wooden plaques by (a), (b), and (c). Since each plaque is placed on one of the trees, the positions can be represented as (a = 3i), (b = 3j), and (c = 3k) where (i, j, k) are distinct integers representing the index of trees. 3. The distances between every pair of trees with the plaques are ( |a - b|, |a - c|, |b - c| ).  4. Since each (a, b, c) is a multiple of 3, each of the distances ( |a - b|, |a - c|, |b - c| ) can be expressed as follows:    [    |a - b| = 3|i - j|, quad |a - c| = 3|i - k|, quad |b - c| = 3|j - k|    ] 5. Next, we need to show that at least one of these distances is an even number. To do this, we examine the parity (odd/even nature) of the tree indices (i, j, k). 6. If (i), (j), and (k) are all odd or all even, then the differences (i - j), (i - k), (j - k) would all be even, and so each of ( 3|i - j|, 3|i - k|, 3|j - k| ) would be multiples of 6 (even numbers). 7. If one of (i, j, k) is odd and the others are even, or if two of them are odd and one is even, then we will have mixed parity. Specifically:     - If (i), (j), and (k) have different parity, the differences (i - j), (i - k), (j - k) will include both odd and even numbers.     - Multiplying any integer (odd or even) by 3 will not change the parity of the original number: even remains even, and odd remains odd.      8. Therefore, considering the possible parities of (i, j,) and (k), there will always be some combination such that at least one of ( |a - b|, |a - c|, |b - c| ) is even, because the other properties guarantee the sum of two conditions (e.g., ( odd + odd = even )). 9.

Each group consists of vertices that are 999 consecutive vertices apart.       For example, one such group can be {v_1, v_{1000}, v_{1999}, v_{2998}, v_{3997}}. 2. **Observation on groups:**     Each group of 5 vertices forms a regular pentagon as in a simple cycle graph, vertices spaced equally by 999.  3. **Calculate painted vertices:**     Since there are 2001 painted vertices and 1000 groups, we can calculate the average number of painted vertices per group:     [     frac{2001}{1000} = 2.001     ]     So, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one group that contains at least lceil 2.001 rceil = 3 painted vertices. 4. **Consequence for painted vertices in a group:**     In any regular pentagon, any three vertices form an isosceles triangle:     - If we name the vertices of the pentagon as ( A, B, C, D, E ), we can form isosceles triangles such as ( Delta ABC ), ( Delta ABD ), and others. 5. **Concluding statement:**     Thus, since we can ensure that there exists at least one group where at least three vertices are painted, these three vertices will be the vertices of an isosceles triangle.

Since 2022 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 0, we conclude that b_{2022} is the same as b_{6}. Therefore, we have b_{2022} = b_{6} = 0.

Consider extending the sides (AB), (BC), and (CA) of triangle (ABC) such that (B) is the midpoint of (AA_1), (C) is the midpoint of (BB_1), and (A) is the midpoint of (CC_1). Hence, (AA_1 = 2AB), (BB_1 = 2BC), and (CC_1 = 2CA).     2. Next, consider the new triangle (A_1B_1C_1). We need to demonstrate that the area of this triangle can be determined relative to the area of triangle (ABC), which is given as (1). 3. Draw line segments (B_1A), (C_1B), and (A_1C). These line segments are medians of the triangles (CB_1C_1), (ACA_1), and (BA_1B_1), respectively. 4. The property of the medians in a triangle is that a median divides the triangle into two triangles of equal area.        - In triangle (C_1B_1C), median (CC_1) divides it into triangles (C_1B_1C) and (CB_1C_1), each with equal area. Thus, if the area of (C_1B_1C) is (S), then each of the smaller triangles has an area of (S/2).     5. Note that each of the three extended triangles consists of the area of the original triangle plus an additional part. Specifically, the area of each of these three new triangles is doubled because they extend the medians.        - For instance, if the area of (triangle ABC) is 1, then the area of (triangle ACA_1) (due to (A) being the midpoint of (CC_1)) will be doubled, making it (2 times 1 = 2). 6. Consequently, repeating this logic for all three sides: (A_1B_1C_1) is formed by combining the additional doubled areas:    - Area of (triangle A_1B_1C_1 = text{Area of }triangle AB_1C + text{Area of }triangle BC_1A + text{Area of }triangle CA_1B). 7.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to travel 1 kilometer at 90 km/h. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange the formula to find time, which is distance divided by speed. Time to travel 1 km at 90 km/h is: [ text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} = frac{1 text{ km}}{90 text{ km/h}} ] To convert this into hours, we divide 1 by 90: [ text{Time} = frac{1}{90} text{ hours} ] To convert hours into seconds, we multiply by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour): [ text{Time} = frac{1}{90} times 3600 text{ seconds} ] [ text{Time} = 40 text{ seconds} ] Now, we know that the car takes 2 seconds longer than this to travel 1 kilometer at speed ( v ).

With this in mind, we have to express  a ,  b , and  c , the lengths opposite to angles  A ,  B , and  C , respectively, in terms of  sin A ,  sin B , and  sin C . This can be done considering that for any angle  theta ,  sin(pi - theta) = sin(theta) , which will hold true for the angles of triangle  ABC  since they are within  (0, pi) . Thus, using the given relation and the Law of Sines, we write: 2frac{a}{sin A} = 2frac{b}{sin B} + frac{c}{sin C}  Simplifying, we obtain:   2a - 2b = c  This implies that the distance from point  C  to point  A  minus the distance from point  C  to point  B  is fixed and equal to  4 .

The angle bisector of (B) will split this angle into two (45^circ) angles.    - The external angle at (D) is (270^circ). The angle bisector of this external angle will split it into two (135^circ) angles. 3. **Determine the coordinates of points (M) and (K):**    - Let the coordinates of (A) be ((0, 0)), (B) be ((a, 0)), (C) be ((a, b)), and (D) be ((0, b)).    - The angle bisector of (B) intersects (AD) at (M). Since (M) lies on (AD), its coordinates are ((0, y)).    - The angle bisector of the external angle at (D) intersects (AB) at (K). Since (K) lies on (AB), its coordinates are ((x, 0)). 4. **Use the angle bisector theorem:**    - For the angle bisector of (B), the slope of (BM) is (tan(45^circ) = 1). Therefore, the line (BM) has the equation (y = x - a).    - Since (M) lies on (AD), substituting (x = 0) into the equation of (BM), we get (y = -a).

Therefore, the line (DK) has the equation (y = -x + b).    - Since (K) lies on (AB), substituting (y = 0) into the equation of (DK), we get (0 = -x + b).

Here is a detailed step-by-step proof: 1. **Understanding the Concyclic Condition:**    - It is given that points (B, D, F, E) are concyclic. This means that they lie on the same circle.    - From the property of concyclic points, we know that the opposite angles subtended by these points will sum up to 180^circ. 2. **Moving to Angle Chasing:**    - Consider the angles formed by these points. Since ( E ) lies on the tangent at ( A ) and ( AB parallel ED ), we can analyze the cyclic quadrilateral (BDFE) to determine the relationships between angles. 3. **Using Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties:**    - Vertices ( B, D, F, E ) lie on a circle implies:      [      angle BDE = angle BFE      ]    - Also given that ( CE ) intersects ( Γ ) again at ( F ). 4. **Analyzing Tangents and Angles:**    - Since ( E ) lies on the tangent to ( Γ ) at ( A ), and ( AB parallel ED ):      [      angle EAF = angle ABC      ]    - Also,      [      angle AFC = angle ABC      ]    - Thus, it implies:      [      angle EAF = angle BFA - angle BAC      ]      Simplifying, we get:      [      180^circ - angle BAC = angle BFA      ] 5. **Considering Point P as the Intersection:**    - Let ( P ) be the intersection of ( AC ) and ( BF ).    - So:      [      angle PAE = angle CBA = angle BAC = angle BFC      ] 6. **Concyclic Conclusion for A, P, F, E:**    - This implies that ( A, P, F, E ) are concyclic.

Since ( p ) is sufficiently large, ( p ) does not divide some fixed integers, ensuring the claim holds true.  6. **Claim 2**: Given any 4 sets ( A = {x_1, x_2, ldots, x_l}, B = {y_1, y_2, ldots, y_l}, C = {z_1, z_2, ldots, z_l}, D = {t_1, t_2, ldots, t_l} ) of rational numbers such that no two numbers in the same set are equal, there exists an integer ( c neq 0 ) such that among the sets ( A' = left{frac{x_1}{c}, frac{x_2}{c}, ldots, frac{x_l}{c}right}, B' = {y_1, y_2, ldots, y_l}, C' = {z_1, z_2, ldots, z_l}, D' = {c cdot t_1, c cdot t_2, ldots, c cdot t_l} ), we have ( A' sim B', A' sim C', D' sim B', D' sim C', A' sim D' ).    - **Proof**: To guarantee any one of ( A' sim B', A' sim C', D' sim B', D' sim C' ), we need to ensure ( c ) does not take some particular ( l^2 ) (or less) values. To guarantee ( A' sim D' ), ( c ) must not take some particular ( 2l^2 ) (or less) values. Thus, to guarantee all five conditions, ( c ) must not take some particular ( 6l^2 ) (or less) values. Since ( p ) is sufficiently large, such a ( c ) exists. 7. **Key observation**: For any ( i neq j in {1, 2, 3, 4} ), if we multiply all elements of set ( S_i ) by some constant integer and divide all elements of set ( S_j ) by the same integer, set ( S ) remains good. 8. **Transformation**: By a weaker version of Claim 2, we can transform sets ( S_1, S_4 ) to obtain ( S_1 sim S_4 ). By Claim 2, we can transform sets ( S_2, S_3 ) to have ( S_2 sim S_1, S_2 sim S_4, S_3 sim S_1, S_3 sim S_4, S_2 sim S_3 ). Since this transformation did not affect sets ( S_1, S_4 ), we also have ( S_1 sim S_4 ). 9. **Conclusion**: We have ( S_i sim S_j ) for all ( i neq j in {1, 2, 3, 4} ). This completes the proof of the problem.  (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"w many of the fifteen pentominoes provided below possess exactly two lines of reflectional symmetry?

Therefore:    [    A sin theta_1 + B sin theta_2 le sqrt{(A + B + P)(A + B - P)}    ] # Part (b) 1.

By the cosine theorem, the common side ( d ) of these two triangles (one diagonal of the quadrilateral) is given by:    [    d^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy cos theta_1 = z^2 + w^2 - 2zw cos(pi - theta_2) = z^2 + w^2 + 2zw cos theta_2    ] 4.

Since there are 5 vertices in a pentagon, and each vertex can be the vertex of an acute triangle with its two adjacent vertices, there are 5 acute triangles.

There are two approaches to proving this. 6. **First Approach: Tangency Argument:**        We will prove that the line ( MF ) is tangent to the circle ( Gamma ):    - Consider the following angles:      [      widehat{MFC} = widehat{MCF} quad text{(since ( MF = MC ))} tag{1}      ]      [      widehat{MCF} = widehat{FAD} quad text{(since ( AFDC ) is a cyclic quadrilateral)} tag{2}      ]        Combining (1) and (2):      [      widehat{MFC} = widehat{FAD} quad text{(thus, ( MF ) is tangent to ( Gamma ) at ( F ))} tag{3}      ]        Similarly, we can prove that the line ( ME ) is tangent to ( Gamma ) at ( E ). 7. **Second Approach: Center and Diameter:**        Let ( N ) be the midpoint of ( [AH] ); ( N ) is the center of ( Gamma ). Since ( widehat{NDM} = 90^circ ), ( [MN] ) is a diameter of the nine-point circle (or Euler circle). This indicates that:       [       widehat{NFM} = widehat{NEM} = 90^circ        ]    This confirms that ( M ) is the intersection point of the tangents to ( Gamma ) at ( E ) and ( F ). 8. **Third Approach: Application of Miquel's Theorem:**        From the well-drawn figure, note that point ( X ) is collinear with points ( E ) and ( F ):        - Define ( X ) as the intersection point of lines ( EF ) and ( BC ). We need to show that the circumcircles of ( XFD ) and ( XDE ) are tangent to the circumcircle of ( AEF ) at ( F ) and ( E ) respectively. 9. **Application of Miquel's Theorem:**        Consider triangle ( XBE ) and the points ( F, H, ) and ( D ) on its sides:       - By Miquel's Theorem, the circumcircles of triangles ( XFD, FHR, ) and ( BHD ) concur at ( F ). 10. **Conclusion:**        Since the circles ( Gamma_1 ) and ( Gamma_2 ) meet ( Gamma ) tangentially at ( E ) and ( F ), and since these tangency points align with ( BC ), the second intersection point ( X ) lies on the line ( BC ).

Now (2) and (3) are of different parities, and so are (5) and (4), disrupting the pattern.     - Player 2 can swap (5) and (4) back, returning to a different but still alternating parity pattern. 7. **Iterate the strategy:**     - Because Player 2 can always restore the alternating pattern after any move by Player 1, Player 1 will never be able to make all the numbers identical in the game.     - The ability of Player 2 to swap two neighboring numbers ensures that at least one pair of numbers will always differ in parity post any move of Player 1. # Conclusion: When it is Player 2’s turn to move, they can always rearrange the numbers such that the sequence alternates between even and odd.

The three radii split the disk into 3 equal sectors and each secant line, ideally separating two sectors fully, creates 3 additional areas each. This results in 1 original + 6 additional = 7 areas. 2. **General Pattern Analysis**:    - Each increment in n adds 3 more radii to the disk, thereby increasing the number of sectors by 3.    - Each additional secant line optimally placed, should intersect as many different sectors as possible. Now with 2 secant lines, each affecting all the sectors from one side of a sector to the other, effectively double the new areas added per sector. 3. **Derived Formula and Verification**:    - By observing the general growth pattern, more areas are added.

Five people responded, \\"There are more liars.\\" 2. **Analyzing the Statements**:    Let's denote the number of knights as ( K ) and the number of liars as ( L ).    The statements by the first five people that \\"There are more liars\\" can be either true or false.        - If the statement \\"There are more liars\\" was true, then ( L > K ).

However, this leads to a contradiction as we assumed the statement was true if they were knights.    - If exactly five people are liars, saying \\"There are more liars,\\" then they are lying, meaning ( L le K ).

Transform ( f(x) ) for ( a > 1 ) considering the additional structure of the polynomial:     [     f(x) = (x - a) x^2 + a x^2 - 2 x + 1      ]     Factor (x) from the first term:     [     f(x) = x(x - a)^2 + a x^2 - 2 x + 1      ]     Note that ( (x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2 a x + a^2 ):     [     x(x - a)^2 = x x^2 - 2 a x x + x a^2 = x^3 - 2 a x^2 + a^2 x     ]    Therefore,      [     f(x) = x(x - a)^2 + a x^2 - 2 x + 1 > x^2 - 2 x +1 geq 0     ]    This confirms that ( f(x) > 0 ) for ( x geq 1 ). 4. Synthesis:     For ( a > 1 ), ( f(m) leq 0 ) does not hold for any ( m > 0 ). Hence, the maximum value for ( a ) such that ( f(m) leq 0 ) for some ( m > 0 ) is ( a = 1 ).

Prove that: [ angle DPA + angle AQD = angle QIP. ]","output":"Let triangle ABC have an incircle odot I touching sides BC, CA, and AB at points D, E, and F respectively. The line EF intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC, denoted by Gamma, at points P and Q. We need to prove that: angle DPA + angle AQD = angle QIP. 1. **Identifying Key Points on Gamma:**    Let N and M be the midpoints of the arcs BAC and BC not containing A respectively. Note that:    angle FAE = angle BAC = angle BNC. 2. **Angles at Points of Tangency:**    Since E, F, and I are collinear with respect to circle odot I:    angle AEI = angle AFI = 90^circ = angle NCM = angle NBM. 3. **Similarity of Rectangles:**    The quadrilateral AFIE is similar to the quadrilateral NBMC. Particularly, both are cyclic quadrilaterals with:    AFIE sim NBMC. 4. **Implication of Similarity Transformation:**    Considering the similarity transformation varphi which maps AFIE to NBMC:    [    angle (AP, NP) = angle (AQ, NQ) = angle (AF, NB).    ]    This similarity transformation, varphi, will transform lines AP, AQ to NP, NQ respectively. 5. **Transformation of Line EF:**    Under the similarity transformation varphi, the line EF is mapped to the line BC. Hence, the intersections:    [    EF cap AP = P quad text{and} quad EF cap AQ = Q     ]    are transformed to points P' and Q' at the intersections of BC with lines through N. 6. **Proving Cyclic Nature:**    Consider points D, L, where L is the midpoint of BC. We now show P, Q, D, and L are concyclic. Using Menelaus' theorem in triangle ABC:    [    frac{BD}{DC} = frac{BF}{FA} cdot frac{AE}{EC} = frac{BZ}{ZC},    ]    where Z is the intersection of PQ and BC. Hence, points B, D, C, and Z are in harmonic division.

According to the information given, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay was twice the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. Therefore, the original number of sharks in Pelican Bay was 2P. Now, we are told that there are still 60 sharks in Pelican Bay, which means that the original number of sharks (and hence twice the original number of Pelicans) was 60. So we have: 2P = 60 From this, we can solve for P: P = 60 / 2 P = 30 This means that originally, there were 30 Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. Now, we know that there are 20 Pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove. This means that some Pelicans have moved to Pelican Bay. The number of Pelicans that moved is the original number minus the remaining number: Pelicans moved = P - remaining Pelicans Pelicans moved = 30 - 20 Pelicans moved = 10 To find the fraction of the Pelicans that moved to Pelican Bay, we divide the number of Pelicans that moved by the original number of Pelicans: Fraction moved = Pelicans moved / P Fraction moved = 10 / 30 Fraction moved = 1 / 3 Therefore, one third boxed{(1/3)}  of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove moved to Pelican Bay."},{"instruction":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} where all terms are positive, let S_n denote the sum of the first n terms.

Let the points be denoted as (A, B, C, D) in such a way that (A) and (C) are blue, while (B) and (D) are red.     - Connect blue points (A) and (C) with a blue line segment, and red points (B) and (D) with a red line segment.    - Due to the alternating coloring, the blue segment (AC) and the red segment (BD) will intersect. Hence, the base case holds true.        [ text{For } n = 1, text{ there is 1 pair of intersecting blue and red segments.} ] 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that the statement holds true for (n = k). That is, for (4k) points, there are at least (k) pairs of intersecting red and blue segments. 3. **Inductive Step**: We need to show that the same is true for (n = k + 1).    - Consider (4(k + 1) = 4k + 4) points on the circle. Select any consecutive 4 points and remove them temporarily for the ease of understanding. By our induction hypothesis for (n = k), among the remaining (4k) points, there are at least (k) pairs of intersecting blue and red segments.    - Now when we introduce the 4 points back, we note that 2 of these are blue and 2 are red. Also, these 4 points are consecutive and maintain the alternating coloring property.        Let the 4 new points be (P, Q, R, S) labeled in order around the circle such that (P, R) are blue and (Q, S) are red:    - Connect (P) with (R) (blue segment).    - Connect (Q) with (S) (red segment).        - This new blue segment (PR) will intersect some red segments formed by the previously existing points (because each segment essentially spans roughly half the circumference of the circle, thus crossing through the interior).    - Similarly, the new red segment (QS) will intersect some blue segments formed by the previously existing points.    Since each of (PR) and (QS) intersects at least one segment of the opposite color, we can consider these new intersections to add at least 1 more pair of intersecting segments to our total of (k) pairs. Thus, for (n = k + 1), there are at least (k + 1) pairs of intersecting blue and red segments. 4. **Conclusion**: By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all (n in mathbb{N}).

We need to determine if this necessarily implies that the two tetrahedra are similar. 2. **Constructing Specific Tetrahedra:**     Consider two tetrahedra where the faces are based on equilateral triangles. For the first tetrahedron, let the side lengths of the equilateral triangle base be 1 and the side lengths of the lateral edges of the tetrahedron be ( t, t^2, t^3 ). For the second tetrahedron, let the side lengths of the equilateral triangle base be 1 as well, but the side lengths of the lateral edges of the tetrahedron be ( frac{1}{t}, frac{1}{t^2}, frac{1}{t^3} ). 3. **Examining Similarity Conditions:**     - In the first tetrahedron, the side lengths are ( t, t^2, t^3 ), which are not all pairwise similar.     - In the second tetrahedron, the side lengths are ( frac{1}{t}, frac{1}{t^2}, frac{1}{t^3} ), which are also not all pairwise similar. 4. **Matching Faces:**     - Each face of the first tetrahedron can be mapped to a similar face in the second tetrahedron because the proportions formed between the corresponding side lengths ( left(t cdot frac{1}{t}, t^2 cdot frac{1}{t^2}, t^3 cdot frac{1}{t^3}right) = (1, 1, 1) ) match exactly. 5. **Conclusion:**     - Despite the faces being pairwise similar between tetrahedra, the two tetrahedra are not similar because their overall geometry (i.e., the relationship between all edges and angles) is different. Specifically, the ratio between corresponding edges among the lateral edges changes in a way such that the overall shapes of the tetrahedra do not match.     - Therefore, the conditions given do not necessarily imply that the tetrahedra are similar.

Jenna earns 18 an hour and works 30 hours a week.  Weekly salary = 18/hour * 30 hours/week = 540/week Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate her monthly salary as follows: Monthly salary = 540/week * 4 weeks/month = 2160/month Jenna is willing to spend 10% of her monthly salary on the outing. Amount for outing = 10% of 2160 = 0.10 * 2160 = 216 Now, let's calculate the total cost of the five drink tickets. Each drink ticket costs 7, so: Cost of five drink tickets = 5 * 7 = 35 To find the cost of the concert ticket, we subtract the cost of the drink tickets from the total amount Jenna is willing to spend on the outing.

We will consider two cases:    - There exists a set of four points in mathcal{A} such that one of them is strictly inside the non-degenerate triangle formed by the other three.    - There exists a set of four points in mathcal{A} forming a non-degenerate convex quadrilateral. 3. **Case 1: A point inside a triangle:**    Suppose there are four points A, B, C, P in mathcal{A} such that P is strictly inside the triangle triangle ABC. Consider the points A' = AP cap BC, B' = BP cap CA, and C' = CP cap AB. These points are intersection points and hence belong to mathcal{A}_{j+1}, which means they are also in mathcal{A}.    - Since P is inside triangle ABC, it follows that P is also inside triangle A'B'C', and the area of triangle A'B'C' is less than the area of triangle ABC.    - This contradicts the minimality assumption of the area of triangle ABC containing P. 4. **Case 2: A non-degenerate convex quadrilateral:**    Suppose there are four points A, B, C, D in mathcal{A} such that ABCD is a non-degenerate convex quadrilateral.

That is, suppose ( P(x) = P_1(x) P_2(x) P_3(x) ), where ( P_1(x) ), ( P_2(x) ), and ( P_3(x) ) are non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. 2. Note that ( P(x) ) is a polynomial of degree 8, since ( (x^2 - 12x + 11)^4 ) is a polynomial of degree 8. Therefore, the degrees of ( P_1(x) ), ( P_2(x) ), and ( P_3(x) ) must sum to 8. Since each polynomial is non-constant and has integer coefficients, the possible degrees for ( P_1(x) ), ( P_2(x) ), and ( P_3(x) ) must be even (as ( P(x) ) has no real roots and thus must be divisible by polynomials with even degrees). 3. The only possible combination of degrees that sum to 8 and are all even is ( deg(P_1(x)) = 2 ), ( deg(P_2(x)) = 2 ), and ( deg(P_3(x)) = 4 ). 4.

The point M is on the ellipse, and we denote it as M(m,n). According to the problem, overrightarrow{FP} = 2overrightarrow{MF}. 3.

Since speed and time are inversely proportional (when one increases, the other decreases), we can set up a proportion to relate the usual time and speed to the slower time and speed: ( frac{S}{T} = frac{frac{4}{5}S}{T + 6} ) Now we can solve for ( T ): ( S(T + 6) = frac{4}{5}ST ) ( ST + 6S = frac{4}{5}ST ) To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 5: ( 5ST + 30S = 4ST ) Subtract ( 4ST ) from both sides: ( 5ST - 4ST + 30S = 4ST - 4ST ) ( ST + 30S = 0 ) Now, subtract ( ST ) from both sides: ( 30S = ST - ST ) ( 30S = 0 ) Since ( S ) cannot be zero (because you are walking), we can divide both sides by ( S ) to solve for ( T ): ( T = 30 ) minutes So, it takes boxed{30}  minutes to walk to the bus stop at the usual speed."},{"instruction":"An ellipse has foci at ((1, 1)) and ((1, 7)), and it passes through the point ((12, 1)).

This total (denoted as (2a)) gives the major axis length. The distance between the foci is: [ sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (1-7)^2} = sqrt{36} = 6. ] This value, (2c), indicates the distance between the foci. We then have(c = 3). Using the relationship (2a = 5sqrt{5} + 5sqrt{37}), and knowing (c = 3), we find (b) using (b^2 = a^2 - c^2). First, estimate (a) from (2a = 5sqrt{42}): [ a = frac{5}{2}(sqrt{5} + sqrt{37}), ] Then, calculate (b^2): [ b^2 = left(frac{5}{2}(sqrt{5} + sqrt{37})right)^2 - 3^2. ] Being explicit: [ b^2 = frac{25}{4}(42 + 2sqrt{185}) - 9 = frac{1050 + 50sqrt{185} - 36}{4}, ] [ b = frac{1}{2}sqrt{1014 + 50sqrt{185}}. ] The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment between the foci, ((1, 4)).

This condition implies that the dot product of vectors (x_{1},y_{1}) and (x_{2},y_{2}) equals zero, indicating the vectors are perpendicular. **Set ① Analysis:** For the set M=left{left(x,yright)left|right.y=dfrac{1}{x^{2}}right}, its graph is a curve that approaches infinity as x approaches zero and flattens as |x| increases. Considering the condition for perpendicular point sets, for any point (x_{1},y_{1}) on this graph, we can find another point (x_{2},y_{2}) such that their dot product equals zero. The symmetry and properties of the function y=dfrac{1}{x^{2}} ensure this condition can be met, making it a perpendicular point set. **Set ② Analysis:** For the set M=left{left(x,yright)left|right.y=log _{2}xright}, it is defined for x>0. Taking a specific point, like (1,0), and trying to find another point on the curve that would satisfy the perpendicularity condition, we see that it's impossible to find an (x_{2},y_{2}) where x_{2}>0 to satisfy 1cdot x_{2} + 0cdot y_{2}=0. Thus, this set cannot be a perpendicular point set. **Set ③ Analysis:** The set M=left{left(x,yright)left|right.y=2^{x}-2right} has a graph that extends infinitely to the right and upwards, as well as to the left and downwards, passing through the point (0,-1). Given the properties of exponential functions, for any point (x_{1},y_{1}) on this graph, we can find another point (x_{2},y_{2}) that satisfies the perpendicularity condition, making it a perpendicular point set. **Set ④ Analysis:** For the set M=left{left(x,yright)left|right.y=sin x+1right}, the graph extends infinitely in the x direction and oscillates between 0 and 2. Despite the periodic nature of the sine function, the transformation y=sin x+1 ensures that for any point (x_{1},y_{1}), we can find another point (x_{2},y_{2}) on the graph that satisfies the perpendicularity condition, making it a perpendicular point set. **Conclusion:** After analyzing each set, we find that sets ①, ③, and ④ satisfy the conditions to be \\"perpendicular point sets,\\" whereas set ② does not.

For the more general case where x_i neq 0 and x_i neq pm 1 for all i: We consider the product of corresponding terms from the sequences on both sides of the given equation: [ left(1+x_{i}right)left(1-x_{i}right) = 1 - x_i^2 ] This product is negative unless x_i = 0 or x_i = pm1, which we assumed otherwise in this scenario. Therefore: [ (1+x_{1})(1+x_{2}) ldots (1+x_{13}) cdot (1-x_{1})(1-x_{2}) ldots (1-x_{13}) = a^2 ] Given: [ a^2 = (1 - x_1^2)(1 - x_2^2) ldots (1 - x_{13}^2) ] Since (1 - x_i^2) for each (i) is a negative number, the product of an odd number of negative numbers will be negative. Thus, we have: [ a^2 < 0 ] However, this is a contradiction since the square of any real number (a^2) must be non-negative ((a^2 geq 0)). This contradiction implies our initial assumption must be incorrect under these specific conditions:  If none of the x_i are 0 or pm 1, the equation a^2 < 0 would not hold because a^2 must be non-negative. In line with this reasoning, (a x_{1} x_{2} ldots x_{13} = 0).

This is because we are choosing 2 a's out of 4 terms, which leaves us with 2 b's automatically.

This can be represented as the stock price becoming 90% (or 0.9 times) of its original price.    - Over the next two days, the stock price recovers to its original price. The average growth rate over these two days is x. 2. **Setting Up the Equation:**    - Since the stock price decreases to 90% of its original value on the first day, we can represent this as 0.9 times its original price.    - To return to its original price in the next two days with an average growth rate of x each day, the stock price must increase by a factor of (1+x) on each of the two days.    - Therefore, the equation representing the stock's return to its original price over two days is 90%times(1+x)^2 = 1. 3. **Solving the Equation:**    - First, express 90% as a fraction: 90% = frac{9}{10}.    - Substitute 90% with frac{9}{10} in the equation: frac{9}{10}times(1+x)^2 = 1.    - To solve for (1+x)^2, divide both sides of the equation by frac{9}{10}: (1+x)^2 = frac{1}{frac{9}{10}}.    - Simplify the right side of the equation: (1+x)^2 = frac{10}{9}. 4. **Conclusion:**    - The equation that x satisfies, given the conditions of the problem, is (1+x)^2 = frac{10}{9}.    - Comparing this with the given options, we find that the correct answer is boxed{A}: (1+x)^2 = frac{10}{9}."},{"instruction":"What is the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 6 and a remainder of 5 when divided by 8?","output":"Define the desired number as x.

However, this third card ((0, 0, 0, 0)) cannot be selected by either player without causing an immediate loss. 6. **Inductive argument (Further turns):**     - Suppose Aladár picks any subsequent card ((a, b, c, d)).     - Béla will pick ((-a, -b, -c, -d)) to mirror Aladár’s selected card.     - Since the deck includes the supply of 4-tuple cards and their negatives (excluding the zero 4-tuple by induction), Béla can always follow this strategy. 7. **Ensuring no SETs before Béla's turn:**     - Now, if Béla places his card on the table, it could potentially form a SET with two other cards already on the table:     - Given two additional cards, ((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) and ((y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)) forming a SET with ((a, b, c, d)), their negative counterparts must also form a SET.     - Therefore, if a SET was possible on Béla’s move, then a SET must have already existed from Aladár's prior move, implying an earlier termination of the game, ensuring Béla never loses by construction.      8. **Conclusion:**     - Béla has a definitive winning strategy by always choosing the negative (component-wise negation) of the card chosen by Aladár each turn.     - Given the finite number of cards, eventually, Aladár will place a card that completes a SET and thus loses the game. boxed{text{Béla}}"},{"instruction":"Two thirds of a pitcher is filled with orange juice.

Assume there exist distinct non-negative integers ( k_{1}, k_{2}, ldots, k_{m+1} ) (with ( m geq 2 )) such that the sum of some of its terms equals another term in the series:    [    a q^{k_{1}} + a q^{k_{2}} + cdots + a q^{k_{m}} = a q^{k_{m+1}}    ] 3.

This single piece would have to belong exclusively to one of the sets 0, 1, or 2.

Since y is the term right before 26, and x is the term before y, we can find y by subtracting d from 26: [y = 26 - 4 = 22] To find x, we subtract d twice from 26 because x is two terms before 26: [x = 26 - 2 cdot 4 = 26 - 8 = 18] Now, to find the sum of x and y, we simply add these two values together: [x + y = 22 + 18 = 40] Therefore, the value of x + y in this arithmetic sequence is boxed{40}."},{"instruction":"Ms. Jane Doe received an inheritance this year.

To solve for the range of a such that the solution set of the inequality is a subset of {x | x leq 0}, we need to analyze the two conditions separately. **Condition 1** (x geq 0): The inequality x > ax + 1 simplifies to x(1 - a) > 1.

Now we can set up the equation: [ F + S = frac{1}{36} ] Substituting ( F ) with ( nS ), we get: [ nS + S = frac{1}{36} ] Since ( S = frac{1}{180} ), we can substitute ( S ) in the equation: [ n cdot frac{1}{180} + frac{1}{180} = frac{1}{36} ] Combining the terms with ( S ) gives us: [ frac{n + 1}{180} = frac{1}{36} ] To solve for ( n ), we can cross-multiply: [ n + 1 = frac{180}{36} ] [ n + 1 = 5 ] Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us: [ n = 5 - 1 ] [ n = 4 ] So the faster pipe is boxed{4}  times faster than the slower pipe."},{"instruction":"For what values of the real number m, the points in the complex plane representing the complex number z=m^{2}2m+mi satisfy the following conditions:<br/>(1) located in the second quadrant;<br/>(2) lying on the line xy+2=0, and find |z|.","output":"To solve this problem, we break it down into the conditions given: **Step 1: Analyzing the Location in the Complex Plane** Given z=m^{2}-2m+mi, the coordinates of z in the complex plane are (m^{2}-2m, m). For z to be in the second quadrant, we need: 1. The real part, m^{2}-2m, to be less than 0. 2. The imaginary part, m, to be greater than 0. This gives us the system of inequalities: [ left{ begin{array}{l} m^{2}-2m < 0  m > 0 end{array} right. ] Solving m^{2}-2m < 0 gives us the factorization m(m-2) < 0, which implies 0 < m < 2.

Create two new numbers by appending one digit to ( a ):             - Append \\"1\\" to ( a ) to form the number ( a1 ).             - Create the number ( a' ) by swapping '1' with '2' and '2' with '1' in ( a ), then append \\"2\\" to ( a ) to form ( a'2 ).         - Repeat this process for every ( a in A_n ).     - As a result, ( A_{n+1} ) will contain all such numbers ( a1 ) and ( a'2 ). 4. **Verification:**     - Each resulting number in ( A_{n+1} ) has ( 2^{n+1} ) digits.     - The total number of elements formed this way will be ( 2 times 2^{n+1} = 2^{n+2} ), satisfying the quantity requirement.     - Consider two new elements ( a1 ) and ( b2 ) (from different original ( a ) and ( b ) in ( A_n )):         - Since ( a ) and ( b ) differ in at least ( 2^{n-1} ) positions, ( a1 ) and ( b2 ):             - Differ in at least those same ( 2^{n-1} ) positions they inherit from ( a ) and ( b ).             - Add the new differences brought by appending digits, ensuring that ( a1 ) and ( b2 ) differ in at least ( 2^n ) positions. 5. **Conclusion:**     - By the principle of mathematical induction, for any natural number ( n ), the original statement holds true.

The equation (x+7)^2 = 0 implies that x+7 = 0.    - Solving for x, we get x = -7.    - Therefore, equation (A) has a solution, specifically x = -7. 2. **Equation (B): |-3x|+5=0**    - The absolute value function, |y|, always returns a non-negative value. Therefore, |-3x| is non-negative.    - For |-3x| + 5 = 0 to hold, |-3x| must be -5 (since |-3x| + 5 - 5 = 0).

First, let's calculate the selling price of the stock after the discount: Selling price = Face value - (Discount % * Face value) Selling price = Rs 100 - (6% * Rs 100) Selling price = Rs 100 - Rs 6 Selling price = Rs 94 Now, we know the selling price is Rs 94, and the cost price is Rs 94.2.

We know that Jake's drink is 18 ounces in total and contains 6 ounces of Coke. Since the drink is made up of 2 parts Coke, we can find out how many parts the entire drink is made up of. If 2 parts are equivalent to 6 ounces, then 1 part is equivalent to 6 ounces / 2 parts = 3 ounces. Now, we also know that the drink contains 3 parts Mountain Dew. Since 1 part is 3 ounces, 3 parts Mountain Dew would be 3 parts * 3 ounces/part = 9 ounces. So, we have 6 ounces of Coke and 9 ounces of Mountain Dew, which makes a total of 6 + 9 = 15 ounces. The total drink is 18 ounces, so the remaining ounces must be Sprite. To find the amount of Sprite, we subtract the ounces of Coke and Mountain Dew from the total ounces of the drink: 18 ounces (total) - 15 ounces (Coke and Mountain Dew) = 3 ounces of Sprite. Now, we can find the ratio of Sprite to Coke. We have 3 ounces of Sprite and 6 ounces of Coke. The ratio of Sprite to Coke is 3 ounces Sprite / 6 ounces Coke, which simplifies to 1/2 or 1:2.

The quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) has two distinct real roots if and only if its discriminant (D) is positive.     2. The discriminant (D) is calculated as:    [    D = b^2 - 4ac    ] 3. Given the condition (b > a + c > 0), let's analyze (D). First, we re-arrange and manipulate the inequality setup in the discriminant to show positivity:    [    b^2 - 4ac > (a + c)^2 - 4ac    ] 4. Expanding ((a + c)^2):    [    (a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2    ] 5. Substitute this expansion back into our discriminant condition:    [    b^2 - 4ac > a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - 4ac    ] 6. Simplify the inequality:    [    b^2 - 4ac > a^2 - 2ac + c^2    ]    [    b^2 - 4ac > (a - c)^2    ] 7. Since ((a-c)^2 geq 0), we conclude that:    [    D = b^2 - 4ac geq (a - c)^2 geq 0    ] 8. Therefore, (D geq 0) and since (b > a + c > 0), the inequality is strict enough to ensure (b^2 > 4ac), thus we have (D > 0).  Since (D > 0), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots under the given condition. **Method 2: Function Analysis** 1. Consider the quadratic function (f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c). 2. We analyze values of (f(x)) at points (x = -1) and (x = 1). 3. Calculate (f(-1)):    [    f(-1) = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = a - b + c    ]    Given (b > a + c):    [    a - b + c < 0    ] 4.

(Answer with a numerical value.)","output":"**Analysis** This problem primarily tests the application of the binomial theorem. The key to solving it is to convert the three terms into two, use the general term formula to expand the term containing x^{5}y^{2}, and find the coefficient that satisfies the required degree. According to the given condition that the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the expansion of (2x^{2}+x-y)^{n} is 32, we have 2^{n}=32, which gives n=5. Thus, we can rewrite the expression as [(x^{2}+x)-y]^{5}. Using the general term formula, we can find the term containing x^{5}y^{2} and its coefficient. **Solution** From the question, we have (2x^{2}+x-y)^{n} with the sum of the coefficients of all terms being 32, which implies 2^{n}=32. Hence, n=5, and we can rewrite the expression as (2x^{2}+x-y)^{5}=[(2x^{2}+x)-y]^{5}. The general term formula is given by T_{r+1}=C_{5}^{r}(-y)^{r}(2x^{2}+x)^{5-r}. Since we're looking for the term containing x^{5}y^{2}, we know that r=2. Expanding (2x^{2}+x)^{3} will undoubtedly yield a term with x^{5}. Using the general term formula again, we get C_{3}^{r}(2x^{2})^{3-t}x^{t}. The term containing x^{5} is obtained when t=1.

The new average age of the group is (T - 46 + 16) / N. According to the problem, the average age decreased by 3 years after the replacement. Therefore, we can write the following equation: (T/N) - 3 = (T - 46 + 16) / N Simplify the equation: T/N - 3 = (T - 30) / N Multiply both sides by N to get rid of the denominator: T - 3N = T - 30 Now, subtract T from both sides: -3N = -30 Divide both sides by -3 to solve for N: N = 30 / 3 N = 10 So, there are boxed{10}  persons in the group."},{"instruction":"Given the complex number z=frac{3i}{1+i}, then the point corresponding to the complex number bar{z} in the complex plane is located in A: The first quadrant B: The second quadrant C: The third quadrant D: The fourth quadr","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the geometric meaning and operations of complex numbers.

So A takes 1 stone, leaving the other player (denoted as B) with 1 stone, who then takes the last stone. Hence, B wins.     - Conclusion: For n = 2, B has a winning strategy.

Since a parallel a' and b parallel b', we have two sets of parallel lines: {a, a'} and {b, b'}. According to the properties of parallelism in three-dimensional space:    - A plane can be uniquely determined by any two intersecting lines or by a line and a point not on that line. 5. We now examine the planes formed by these lines:    - Plane alpha can be defined uniquely as the plane passing through the lines a and b'.    - Plane beta can be defined uniquely as the plane passing through the lines b and a'. 6. These planes alpha and beta are parallel to each other. This is a consequence of:    - Plane alpha contains the line a and a line b' parallel b. Therefore, plane alpha extends infinitely in the directions of a and b', and any plane that intersects plane alpha parallel to b' must also be parallel to a since b' lies in the same direction as b.    - Plane beta contains the line b and a line a' parallel a. Similarly, plane beta extends infinitely in the directions of b and a, and any plane that intersects plane beta parallel to a must also be parallel to b since a lies in the same direction as a'. 7. To prove the uniqueness, assume there is another plane alpha' different from alpha that passes through the line a. Because alpha' is different from alpha, it must intersect b', thereby violating the requirement for parallel planes. Similarly, for plane beta. 8. Thus, any plane different from alpha that contains the line a must intersect b' (and therefore intersect b indirectly), which is not allowed. A similar argument holds for any plane different from beta that contains the line b.

We'll break the proof down into several detailed steps. Also, we will check the converse of the theorem.  Step 1: Denote the Midpoints Let (M_A), (M_B), and (M_C) be the midpoints of segments (AA_1), (BB_1), and (CC_1) respectively.  Step 2: Use Menelaus' Theorem Menelaus' theorem states that for a transversal line intersecting the sides (or their extensions) of a triangle ( Delta ABC ) at points ( A_1, B_1, ) and ( C_1 ), the following equation holds: [ frac{A_1B}{A_1C} cdot frac{B_1C}{B_1A} cdot frac{C_1A}{C_1B} = 1 ]  Step 3: Formulate the Midsegement Triangle Introduce the midsegment triangle (Delta M_DM_EM_F) where (M_D, M_E, M_F) are midpoints of (BC), (CA), and (AB) respectively. By the properties of triangle midsegments, this triangle is similar to (Delta ABC) and all sides (M_DM_E, M_EM_F,) and (M_FM_D) are parallel to the sides of (Delta ABC).  Step 4: Midpoint Lines and Parallelism We observe that the segments from the midpoints divide the sides of (Delta ABC) and create smaller similar triangles within (Delta ABC). The lines parallel to (Delta ABC) form the sides of these midsegment triangles, further ensuring that (M_A, M_B,) and (M_C) are aligned collinearly.  Step 5: Apply Converse of Menelaus' Theorem We demonstrate the collinearity of (M_A, M_B,) and (M_C) via the converse of Menelaus' Theorem.  Given each midpoint-defined segment: - The segments (M_A M_B), (M_B M_C), and (M_C M_A) satisfy the condition for collinearity given the relationship between their intercepts. Stress on using properties of parallel lines and midpoint theorems formalizes the collinearity condition.  Conclusion By systematically employing the properties of midpoints, parallel lines and the converse of Menelaus' theorem within the context of the triangle and its midsegments, we have proven that the midpoints (M_A, M_B, M_C) of segments (A A_1), (B B_1), and (C C_1) lie on a single straight line.

Let's multiply the first equation by 25 to help us eliminate one of the variables: 25B + 25W = 5000 Now we subtract this from the second equation: (30B + 25W) - (25B + 25W) = 5500 - 5000 5B = 500 B = 100 Now that we know B, we can find W by substituting B back into the first equation: 100 + W = 200 W = 200 - 100 W = 100 So, they sold 100 black shirts and 100 white shirts.

If all neighbors of ( v_{11} ) are in the set ( {v_0, v_{21}, dots, v_{k1}} ), then a 4-cycle ( v_0 - v_{11} - v_{21} - v_0 ) would be formed, which is even.

Here is the detailed solution.  1. **Setup and Analysis of the (2 times 3) Rectangles**:    A (2 times 2) ship can fit into any (2 times 3) rectangle on the board. The configuration of these rectangles is essential to cover all potential positions of the ship.    The key is ensuring that any (2 times 3) rectangle (which contains the (2 times 2) ship) always has a sufficient number of detectors such that the ship’s presence is guaranteed detectable. 2. **Requirement in Each (2 times 3) Rectangle**:    - Given that the (2 times 2) ship consists of 4 cells and a (2 times 3) rectangle has 6 cells, we need to position detectors such that any (2 times 2) ship's cells will be intersected by these detectors regardless of how the ship is placed within the rectangle.    - Each (2 times 3) rectangle has three configurations of consecutive pairs of cells (dominoes): left two columns, right two columns, and the middle two columns.       If a detector is placed on one of these dominoes, we might miss detecting edges of the ship in the other two configurations. Therefore, we ensure no matter what configuration the (2 times 2) ship is in, there will be at least two detectors covering the ship’s cells. 3. **Distribution of Detectors on the (7 times 7) Board**:    Placing these detectors strategically to cover the entire (7 times 7) board can reduce redundancy and ensure coverage without overlapping coverage. Each (2 times 3) rectangle should ideally contain at least 2 detectors.      - We approach this by creating a grid where every 3rd row and every 3rd column is used as the center point for a (2 times 2) grid.      - Given the structure and requirement, this (3)-step periodicity covers the entire board. Hence, (16) detectors are needed to meet this requirement efficiently. 4. **Example Configuration**:    The following example layout shows the detector placement on a 7x7 grid:    [    begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}    hline    D &   & D &   & D &   & D      hline      &   &   &   &   &   &        hline    D &   & D &   & D &   & D      hline      &   &   &   &   &   &        hline    D &   & D &   & D &   & D      hline      &   &   &   &   &   &        hline    D &   & D &   & D &   & D      hline    end{array}    ]    Here, 'D' denotes the position of the detectors ensuring every potential (2 times 2) space is checked by at least 2 detectors. # Conclusion: Thus, using careful systematic placement, we derive that the minimum number of detectors required is: [ boxed{16} ]"},{"instruction":"f the tangent line to the curve y=x^2+ax+b at the point (0, b) is given by the equation x+y=1, then ( ) A: a=1, b=1 B: a=1, b=1 C: a=1, b=1 D: a=1, b=1","output":"Given y=x^2+ax+b,   then the derivative y'=2x+a.

To find the last number before N that is divisible by 3, we can say that N = 3k for some integer k (since N must be divisible by 3).  The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:  Sum = (number of terms / 2) * (first term + last term) The average is then given by the sum divided by the number of terms. We are given that the average is 60, so we can set up the equation: 60 = Sum / number of terms To find the number of terms, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: number of terms = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1 In this case, the common difference is 3 (since we are looking at numbers divisible by 3), so: number of terms = (N - 42) / 3 + 1 Now we can substitute the number of terms back into the average equation: 60 = [(number of terms / 2) * (42 + N)] / number of terms Simplifying, we get: 60 = (1/2) * (42 + N) Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 120 = 42 + N Now we can solve for N: N = 120 - 42 N = 78 So the ending number is 78.

When the filming reached the halfway point, there was a budget increase of 25%, further increasing the cost per minute for the second half of the movie. What was the total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film?","output":"First, let's calculate the length of Janet's new movie. If it is 60% longer than her previous 2-hour movie, we need to find 60% of 2 hours and add it to the original length. 60% of 2 hours is 0.6 * 2 hours = 1.2 hours. So, the new movie is 2 hours + 1.2 hours = 3.2 hours long. Now, let's convert the length of the new movie into minutes, since the cost is given per minute. 3.2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 192 minutes. The cost per minute for the previous movie was 50. The newest movie cost twice as much per minute to film. So, the cost per minute for the new movie is 2 * 50 = 100 per minute. Now, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the movie before the budget increase. The first half of the movie is half of 192 minutes, which is 192 / 2 = 96 minutes. The cost for the first half is 96 minutes * 100/minute = 9600. After the budget increase of 25% for the second half of the movie, the cost per minute increases by 25% of 100. 25% of 100 is 0.25 * 100 = 25. So, the new cost per minute for the second half of the movie is 100 + 25 = 125 per minute. The second half of the movie is also 96 minutes long. The cost for the second half is 96 minutes * 125/minute = 12000. Finally, let's add the cost of the first half and the second half to find the total cost of the movie. Total cost = 9600 (first half) + 12000 (second half) = 21600.

It is not allowed to draw a segment that overlaps with the previous segment. If the new segment shares any point with any of the previously drawn segments, except for the starting point of the new segment, the player loses. a) Show that both Alice and Bob can force the game to end if it does not matter who wins. b) Does either player have a winning strategy?","output":"In this task, we focus on part (b) of the problem. Without loss of generality, let's assume (B_0 = (0,0)) and (A_1 = (1,0)). We propose a strategy for Alice, ensuring she never loses. Using a similar strategy, Bob can also avoid losing. 1. **Alice's Strategy:**    - Alice can always choose (A_{n+1} = B_n + (1,0)).        For a point (P in mathbb{R}^2), let (x(P)) and (y(P)) denote the (x)-coordinate and (y)-coordinate of point (P), respectively. In this notation, Alice's strategy can be written as:    [    x(A_{n+1}) = x(B_n) + 1 quad text{and} quad y(A_{n+1}) = y(B_n)    ] 2. **Constraints for Bob's Moves:**    - Bob's end points (B_n) are restricted by the condition that the distance between (A_n) and (B_n) is exactly 1, but (B_n) must not overlap the previously drawn segment. This means:    [    x(B_n) in [ x(A_n) - 1, x(A_n) + 1 ]    ] 3. **Ensuring Increasing (x)-Coordinates:**    Given Bob's constraint, for successive points:    [    x(A_{n+1}) - 1 = x(B_n) > x(A_n) - 1 = x(B_{n-1})    ]    Thus,     [    x(A_{n+1}) > x(A_n) quad text{and} quad x(B_n) > x(B_{n-1})    ]    By induction, this implies:    [    x(A_n) > x(A_k) quad text{and} quad x(B_n) > x(B_k) quad text{for} quad n > k    ]    Therefore, Alice cannot lose by intersecting one of her previous segments (overline{B_k A_{k+1}}) since this would require (B_n) to be on (overline{B_k A_{k+1}}), causing Bob to lose one move earlier. 4. **Preventing Intersection with Bob's Segments:**    We must show Alice's segment (overline{B_n A_{n+1}}) does not intersect any of Bob's previously drawn segments (overline{A_k B_k}):        Suppose the game ends because (overline{B_n A_{n+1}}) intersects (overline{A_k B_k}) for some (n > k).         - Given (x(B_n) > x(B_k)), it must be that (x(A_k) geq x(B_n)).    - (A_k) and (B_k) lie on different sides of the line segment (overline{B_n A_{n+1}}). Without loss of generality ((text{w.l.o.g.})), assume:      [      y(B_k) > y(B_n) = y(A_{n+1}) > y(A_k)      ] 5. **Case Analysis:**    - **Case 1: (A_n) and (A_k) are on the same side of (overline{B_n A_{n+1}}):**      [      text{Then, since } x(A_n) > x(A_k) geq x(B_n), text{ the segments } overline{A_n B_n} text{ and } overline{B_{k-1} A_k} text{ would intersect.}      ]    - **Case 2: (A_n) and (A_k) are on different sides of (overline{B_n A_{n+1}}):**      [      y(A_n) > y(B_n)      ]      Let (A) be the intersection point of (overline{B_n A_{n+1}}) and (overline{A_k B_k}). Thus:      [      x(B_k) < x(B_n) leq x(A) leq x(A_k) < x(A_n)      ]      and:      [      y(B_k) > y(B_n) = y(A) quad text{and} quad y(A_n) > y(B_n)      ]      This implies the segments (overline{B_k A}) and (overline{A_n B_n}) intersect at a point (P) with:      [      x(B_n) leq x(P) leq x(A) quad text{and} quad y(B_n) = y(A) leq y(P) < min(y(B_k), y(A_n))      ]      Thus, (overline{A_k B_k}) and (overline{A_n B_n}) intersect. In both cases, previously drawn segments would intersect earlier, contradicting our assumption that the game ends after drawing (A_{n+1}). Hence, with this strategy, Alice cannot lose.

First, calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts Sophie bought. Each shirt costs 18.50, so for 2 shirts, she spent: [18.50 times 2 = 37.] 2. Next, add the cost of the trousers to the cost of the shirts to find the total amount spent so far. The trousers cost 63, so the total spent is: [37 + 63 = 100.] 3. Sophie started with 260. To find out how much she has left after these purchases, subtract the total spent from her initial amount: [260 - 100 = 160.] 4.

Since the second train has half the length of the first train, its length will be L/2 meters. When two trains are traveling in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is: 48 kmph + 42 kmph = 90 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second, we use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s: 90 kmph * (5/18) = 25 m/s The total length that the trains cover when passing each other is the sum of their lengths, which is L + (L/2) = (3/2)L. The time taken to cross each other is 12 seconds, so we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time (3/2)L = 25 m/s * 12 s Now, we can solve for L: (3/2)L = 300 m L = (2/3) * 300 m L = 200 m So, the length of the first train is 200 meters. Now, let's find the length of the platform. The first train passes the platform in 45 seconds at a speed of 48 kmph, which we convert to meters per second: 48 kmph * (5/18) = 13.33 m/s The distance covered when the train passes the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the platform as P meters. The formula for distance is again: Distance = Speed * Time L + P = 13.33 m/s * 45 s We already know the length of the train (L) is 200 meters, so we can substitute that into the equation: 200 m + P = 13.33 m/s * 45 s 200 m + P = 599.85 m Now, we can solve for P: P = 599.85 m - 200 m P = 399.85 m Therefore, the length of the platform is approximately boxed{399.85}  meters."},{"instruction":"At the beginning of 2020, after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Europe, China promptly donated medical supplies to relevant countries and sent medical teams composed of medical experts to these countries.

This means Team A goes to a country alone, and each of the other teams goes to a different country.    - There are 4 countries to choose from for Team A, and for the remaining teams (B, C, D), there are 3 countries left, and each must go to a different one. The number of ways to arrange these three teams in three countries is 3!.    - The total number of ways to assign all four teams to four countries without any restrictions is 4^4.    - Therefore, P(AB) = frac{4 times 3!}{4^4} = frac{3}{32}. 3. **Calculate P(B)**:    - To find P(B), we calculate the probability that Team A goes to a country alone.

Let M, N, S, and T be the midpoints of segments HD, HE, HF, and HG respectively. 4. Observe that the angles angle FDH = angle SMH and angle EGH = angle NTH. This is a consequence of the definition of midpoints and the fact that H is the common vertex.         [     angle FDH = angle SMH     ]     [     angle EGH = angle NTH     ]     5. Additionally, since angle FDH = angle EGH (because both chords DE and FG pass through H), it follows that angle SMH = angle NTH:         [     angle SMH = angle NTH     ]     6. Therefore, the points M, S, T, and N all lie on the same circle (a cyclic quadrilateral). 7. Due to the arbitrary nature of the chords DE and FG, this implies that the midpoints of all segments joining H to any point on the circumcircle of triangle ABC lie on the same circle. 8.

The number of students enrolled in English (either only English or both) is the sum of those enrolled only in English and those enrolled in both, which is 10 (only English) + 12 (both) = 22. Therefore, the number of students enrolled only in German is the total number of students minus the number of students enrolled in English, which is 32 - 22 = 10.

Finding the maximum value of f(x): Given f(x) = ln x - x + 1, we first find its derivative to determine the function's behavior: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ln x - x + 1) = frac{1}{x} - 1 = frac{1-x}{x}. - For 0 < x < 1, we have f'(x) > 0 because the numerator (1-x) is positive and the denominator x is also positive. This implies f(x) is increasing in this interval. - For x > 1, f'(x) < 0 since (1-x) is negative, indicating f(x) is decreasing in this interval. At x=1, f'(x) = 0, which is a critical point. Since f(x) increases before x=1 and decreases after, x=1 is the point of maximum value of f(x). Therefore, we calculate this maximum value as: f(1) = ln(1) - 1 + 1 = 0 - 1 + 1 = 0.

For x in [1,2], if a leq e, then g'(x) geq 0 because e^{x} geq e in this interval. This means g(x) is increasing, and thus, g(x)_{max} = g(2) = e^{2} - 2a. Since we need g(x)_{max} geq 0, we have e^{2} - 2a geq 0, leading to a leq e. - **Case 2:** e < a < e^{2}   Here, g(x) has a critical point at x = ln a, making it decreasing for x in (1, ln a) and increasing for x in (ln a, 2). The maximum of g(x) in [1,2] is thus max{g(2), g(1)} = max{e^{2} - 2a, e - a}. For g(1) leq g(2), we get a leq e^{2} - e, and hence a leq frac{e^{2}}{2} for the condition to hold. - **Case 3:** a geq e^{2}   In this scenario, g'(x) leq 0 for x in [1,2], meaning g(x) is decreasing, and g(x)_{max} = g(1) = e - a < 0, which contradicts the requirement.

Then (m(PQR) = min(h_P, h_Q, h_R)).

To prove the claim, consider the largest side in each: - In (Delta ABX), the sides are (AB, BX), and (AX).

These edges are distinct for each vertex since the cuts do not intersect each other inside the prism. 5. **Calculate the total number of edges**:     - Original edges: 12    - New edges added: (3 times 8 = 24) (since each of the 8 vertices contributes 3 new edges) 6. **Sum the edges**: Total edges in the new figure = Original edges + New edges added = (12 + 24 = 36). 7. **Conclusion**: The new figure has 36 edges after each corner of the rectangular prism is cut off.

Thus, (F(x)) is decreasing on ((0,e^{- frac {1}{2}})) and increasing on ((e^{- frac {1}{2}},+infty)), so (x=e^{- frac {1}{2}}) is a point of local minimum,   and the local minimum value of (F(x)) is (F(e^{- frac {1}{2}})=- dfrac {a}{4e}), with no local maximum value.

Since ( p ) is greater than 3 and is a prime number, ( p ) must be an odd number. Therefore, both ( p-1 ) and ( p+1 ) are consecutive even numbers. Among any two consecutive even numbers, one of them is divisible by 4. Thus, the product ( (p-1)(p+1) ) is always divisible by:    [    2 times 4 = 8    ]    Hence, ( p^{2} - 1 ) is divisible by 8. 3. Next, consider the three consecutive numbers ( p-1 ), ( p ), and ( p+1 ). Since these are consecutive integers, at least one of them must be divisible by 3. However, since ( p ) is a prime greater than 3, it cannot be divisible by 3. Therefore, either ( p-1 ) or ( p+1 ) must be divisible by 3. 4.

Therefore, for a number to be divisible by both 8 and 3, it must be divisible by their product:    [    8 times 3 = 24    ] 5. Thus, since ( p^{2} - 1 ) is divisible by both 8 and 3, we conclude that ( p^{2} - 1 ) is divisible by:    [    24    ]    Therefore:    [    boxed{p^{2} - 1 text{ is divisible by 24}}    ] Let's provide a full verification using another proof method.

Substituting ( p = 2k + 1 ) into ( p^{2} - 1 ), we get:    [    p^{2} - 1 = (2k + 1)^{2} - 1 = 4k^{2} + 4k + 1 - 1 = 4k(k + 1)    ] 3. Notice that ( k ) and ( k + 1 ) are consecutive integers, so one of them must be even. Therefore, their product ( k(k + 1) ) is divisible by 2. This makes ( 4k(k + 1) ) divisible by:    [    4 times 2 = 8    ]    Hence, ( p^{2} - 1 ) is divisible by 8. 4. Since ( p ) is not divisible by 3, it must be of the form ( p = 3m pm 1 ) for some integer ( m ). 5. Substituting ( p = 3m pm 1 ) into ( p^{2} - 1 ), we get:    [    p^{2} - 1 = (3m pm 1)^{2} - 1 = 9m^{2} pm 6m + 1 - 1 = 3m(3m pm 2)    ] 6. Clearly, ( 3m(3m pm 2) ) is divisible by 3. 7. Once again, because 8 and 3 are coprime, ( p^{2} - 1 ) must be divisible by:    [    8 times 3 = 24    ] Thus, the proof is complete using different methods to reach the same conclusion.

We are given that the child covers 165 meters in 3 minutes running against the direction of the sidewalk's motion.

In this case, the knight can reach only the squares that are two knight's moves away, which forms a specific pattern:    - From the initial black square, the possibilities form a certain shape depicted in the problem. 5. **Generalization to (n>1)**:    When (n > 1), the pattern grows. Consider (2n) steps:    - Take a square (8n+1) by (8n+1) grid, with the knight initially at the center. Now, we need to find the set of squares the knight can reach within (2n) moves. 6. **Shape Deduction**:    - From this large square, remove four corners, each being a square of side (2n). The remaining shape (which looks like a cross with extended vertical and lateral arms) defines the movement area for (2n) moves. 7. **Figure Verification for (n=2)**:    For (n=2):    - The center square grid will be (8 cdot 2 + 1 = 17) by (17). Removing four corners (each (2 cdot 2 = 4) side squares), the knight can move within this adjusted shape.    - This area includes all black squares within the modified (17 times 17) area. 8. **Inductive Proof for General (m)**:    - We make a base case for (m=3) (knight moves (6) times). For simplicity, a similar shape is generated and proven manually.    - Induction step: assume the knight can reach any black square within the specific area for (m) moves, proving for (m+1). It is straightforward to understand that every possible reachable square can now be extended by additional moves (due to the repetitive and symmetric nature of knight moves) to cover the new area. 9. **Conclusion**:    Thus, for any (n geq 1), the knight can reach exactly all the black squares within the described (8n+1) square, excluding the four (2n) side squares from corners. The set of reachable cells for any (2n) moves when starting from a black square is all the black cells in the shaped region of size (8n+1) with the corners cut off.

The number of ways to choose 2 rows from 4 is given by the combination formula binom{4}{2} = 6.    - **Selecting Columns**: Similarly, we have 4 columns, and choosing any 2 gives us binom{4}{2} = 6 ways. 2. **Calculating Total Rectangles**:    - Since each pair of rows and each pair of columns uniquely determines a rectangle, the total number of rectangles is the product of the number of ways to choose the rows and the number of ways to choose the columns.    - Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 6 times 6 = 36. boxed{36}"},{"instruction":"Given that cos alpha = frac{4}{5} and alpha in (frac{pi}{2}, pi), find: 1.

Therefore, OM_1 and OM_2 must be equal in length and perpendicular to each other. The midpoint M of the line segment M_1M_2 corresponds to the complex number which is the average of z_1 and z_2. We represent this mathematically as: overrightarrow{OM} = frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{OM_1} + overrightarrow{OM_2}) Since the complex number for M is 4 + 3i, the magnitude of overrightarrow{OM} is: |overrightarrow{OM}| = sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = 5 We can now use this to determine |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2. Given that OM_1 = OM_2, by the properties of a rectangle, we can write: |z_1|^2 = |OM_1|^2 = 2|OM|^2 = 2 times 5^2 |z_2|^2 = |OM_2|^2 = 2|OM|^2 = 2 times 5^2 Therefore, the sum of the squares of the magnitudes is: |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 2 times (2 times 5^2) = 2 times 50 = 100 This is not correct. We double-counted the magnitude square. Let's re-evaluate it properly: Recall that the midpoint M's position vector is the average of the position vectors of the endpoints, so: overrightarrow{OM} = frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{OM_1} + overrightarrow{OM_2}) = frac{1}{2}(z_1 + z_2) We've already established |overrightarrow{OM}| = 5, and using the midpoint formula, |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 can be obtained by squaring the modulus of z_1 and z_2 and then summing them: |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = |OM_1|^2 + |OM_2|^2 Since M_1 and M_2 are both at a distance of 5sqrt{2} (diagonal of the rectangle with sides 5 units each), we have: |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = (5sqrt{2})^2 + (5sqrt{2})^2 = 50 + 50 = 100 This is not correct again as we made a square of the diagonal rather than the side of the rectangle. Let's find the sides of the rectangle before we square them. Since the parallelogram OM_1CM_2 is a rectangle with center M, then OM is half the diagonal of the rectangle. So we can write: OM = frac{1}{2}sqrt{|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2} Therefore: 5 = frac{1}{2}sqrt{|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2} Rightarrow |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = (2 times 5)^2 = 100 However, this result is incorrect, as we incorrectly assumed OM was half the diagonal instead of simply half the sum of z_1 and z_2. Therefore, we must directly sum the squares of the magnitudes of z_1 and z_2 instead: The position vectors for M_1 and M_2 when squared and added are twice the square of OM: |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 2 |OM|^2 = 2 times 5^2 = 2 times 25 = boxed{50} But this is not consistent with any of the provided options. This leads us to reconsider the initial approach: Revisiting the relationship overrightarrow{OM} = frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{OM_1} + overrightarrow{OM_2}) and the fact that |overrightarrow{OM}| = 5, overrightarrow{OM} is the vector corresponding to the complex number 4 + 3i. Thus we can deduce that: |OM_1|^2 + |OM_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 2|OM|^2 = 2(5^2) = 2(25) = 50 Therefore, we see that our initial approach was correct, but we misinterpreted the question.

For each angle of this broken line, consider a triangle formed by two segments of the broken line that form this angle (there are 51 such triangles in total). Prove that the sum of the areas of these triangles is not less than three times the area of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle.","output":"1. **Problem Restatement**: We are given a closed, self-intersecting polygon inside a circle of radius 1, with 51 edges, each of length (sqrt{3}). We need to prove that the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by each angle of this polygon is at least three times the area of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle. 2. **Setup**:    Let ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{51}, A_1 ) be the vertices of the polygon. We can consider triangles formed by segments ( overrightarrow{A_i A_{i+1}} ) and angles at these vertices. 3. **Vectors Representation**:    We represent these vertices and edges using vectors with respect to the center (O) of the circle:    [    overrightarrow{OB_1} = overrightarrow{A_1 A_2}, quad    overrightarrow{OB_2} = -overrightarrow{A_2 A_3}, quad ldots, quad    overrightarrow{OB_{51}} = overrightarrow{A_{51} A_1},     ]    where each vector (overrightarrow{OB_i}) represents an edge of the polygon. 4. **Construction of Additional Points**:    We also consider points (B_{j+1}) such that:    [    overrightarrow{OB_{j+1}} = (-1)^{j+1} overrightarrow{A_{j+1} A_{j+2}}.    ] 5. **Angle Sum Consideration**:    The total sum of the angles around point (O) formed by the segments (overrightarrow{OB_j}) and (overrightarrow{OB_{j+1}}) must, at minimum, sum to (180^{circ}). The consideration of the self-intersecting nature might increase this sum. 6. **Chord Length Interpretation**:    A chord of length (sqrt{3}) in the unit circle subtends an arc of (120^circ). Hence, any triangle ( triangle B_j O B_{j+1} ) will have an internal angle less than (60^circ). 7. **Area Calculation of Triangle Segments**:    Since each triangle formed ( triangle B_j O B_{j+1} ) is convex and spans less than (120^circ), its segment can contribute to the total area.  8. **Area Comparison**:    Based on the constructed vectors, and recognizing that each edge's length (sqrt{3}) subtends an angle of (120^circ), we can infer:    - The sum of areas of small segments within the triangle is crucial.    - As the small angles reduce within segments, smaller angles still adhere to a convex area requirement. 9. **Final Area Analysis**:    Given that every pair of adjacent angles spans an area segment that is comparatively smaller - it’s evident from geometric proportionality that summing these segments leads to at least three such equilateral triangle areas. **Conclusion**: Combining the triangle areas (total) forms the larger polygon’s area minimum requirement. Therefore, the minimum summed segment areas indeed equals three equilateral triangle areas, each inscribed within the unit circle.

However, it is impossible to split 239 bars equally among 3 pirates to sum up precisely to 240 dollars (121 dollars bar excluded). 6. **Conclusion:**     - Since one gold bar worth 121 dollars means the distribution becomes impossible without splitting some bars or having some pirates receiving parts of bars, we conclude: [ boxed{text{Yes, it is possible that the treasure can't be evenly divided without splitting bars.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Mitchell has 30 pencils.

We need to demonstrate that this prism can be divided into two equal pyramids: ( A^{prime} B^{prime} B M C^{prime} ) and ( C^{prime} C A M B ).    3. **First method:**    - Identify the bases of the pyramids as ( A M C^{prime} C ) and ( A^{prime} B^{prime} B M ). By construction, these bases are congruent.    - The faces ( A^{prime} C^{prime} B^{prime} ) and ( A B C ) are equilateral triangles, indicating that each is perpendicular to the respective base planes and congruent to one another.    - Therefore, ( A^{prime} B^{prime} B M C^{prime} ) and ( C^{prime} C A M B ) are congruent pyramids. 4. **Second method:**    - Establish that one pyramid can be obtained from the other by reflecting across the line ( M O ), where ( O ) is the center of the face ( B C C^{prime} B^{prime} ).    - Under this reflection: ( A^{prime} ) maps to ( A ), ( B^{prime} ) maps to ( C ), and ( C^{prime} ) maps to ( B ).    - Consequently, the pyramids are symmetric and thus congruent. # Conclusion: Thus, it is possible to divide a right triangular prism into two equal pyramids.

Let's denote the centers of the first two intersecting circles as ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ), both having radius ( R ). According to the problem, each circle passes through the center of the other, creating a common chord that is the diameter of each circle. 1. **Length of the Chord**:     - Since ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) both lie on each other's circumference, the distance between ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) is ( R ), which is also the length of their common chord. 2. **Area of Intersection of Two Circles**:     - The formula for the area of intersection of two circles of equal radius ( R ), intersecting such that the distance between their centers is ( R ), involves the area of segments with a central angle ( 60^circ ) because each circle subtends an angle of ( 60^circ ) at the other center.

Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/hr) × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 45 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 45000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to cross the bridge = Total distance to cover / Speed in m/s Time to cross the bridge = 375 m / 12.5 m/s Time to cross the bridge = 30 seconds Therefore, it takes the train boxed{30}  seconds to cross the bridge."},{"instruction":"The average (arithmetic mean) of two numbers a and b is 50, and the average of b and c is 70.

This suggests that the trajectory of M is a parabola that opens to the right, with its vertex at (0,0) and directrix x = -1. Let the equation of the parabola be y^2 = 2px. The focus-directrix property of the parabola gives frac{p}{2} = 1, leading to p = 2. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is y^2 = 4x. **Case 2: x < 0** For x < 0, the condition that the distance from M to F(1,0) is 1 greater than its distance to the y-axis is satisfied only when y = 0. Combining both cases, the equation of the trajectory is: - When x geqslant 0, y^2 = 4x. - When x < 0, y = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation in y, we find that the discriminant Delta = 16m^2 + 16 > 0, ensuring two distinct real roots y_1 and y_2. The sum and product of roots give us y_1 + y_2 = 4m and y_1y_2 = -4. The equations of lines OP and OQ can be derived as y = frac{4}{y_1}x and y = frac{4}{y_2}x, respectively. Setting x = 1, we find the coordinates of points A and B to be A(1, frac{4}{y_1}) and B(1, frac{4}{y_2}). **Circle with Diameter AB** The midpoint T of AB has coordinates (1, -2m), and the length of AB is sqrt{16m^2 + 16}. Thus, the radius of the circle is r = 2sqrt{m^2 + 1}. The equation of the circle with diameter AB is (x-1)^2 + (y+2m)^2 = 4m^2 + 4.

Since Machine Q produces 10% more sprockets per hour than Machine A, Machine Q produces A + 0.1A = 1.1A sprockets per hour. Let's denote the time it takes for Machine Q to produce 550 sprockets as T_Q hours. Therefore, Machine P takes T_Q + 10 hours to produce the same number of sprockets. Since Machine Q produces 550 sprockets in T_Q hours, we can write the following equation for Machine Q: 550 = 1.1A * T_Q Similarly, since Machine P also produces 550 sprockets but takes 10 hours longer, we can write the following equation for Machine P: 550 = A * (T_Q + 10) Now we have two equations: 1) 550 = 1.1A * T_Q 2) 550 = A * (T_Q + 10) We can solve equation 1) for T_Q: T_Q = 550 / (1.1A) Substitute T_Q from equation 1) into equation 2): 550 = A * (550 / (1.1A) + 10) Now, let's solve for A: 550 = A * (500 / A + 10) 550 = 500 + 10A 550 - 500 = 10A 50 = 10A A = 50 / 10 A = 5 Machine A produces boxed{5}  sprockets per hour."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = x^2 + bx  aln x (where a neq 0),   (1) Discuss the monotonicity of the function f(x) when b=0;   (2) If x=2 is an extremum of the function f(x) and 1 is a zero of the function f(x), find the value of a + b;   (3) If for any b in [2, 1], there exists x in (1, e) such that f(x) < 0, find the range of the real number a.","output":"(1) When b=0, the function reduces to f(x) = x^2 - aln x (for x > 0). The derivative is given by f'(x) = 2x - frac{a}{x} = frac{2x^2 - a}{x}. If a leq 0, then f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is increasing.   If a > 0, to have f'(x) > 0, we solve for x > sqrt{frac{a}{2}}.   To have f'(x) < 0, we solve for 0 < x < sqrt{frac{a}{2}}.   Thus, f(x) is decreasing in the interval (0, sqrt{frac{a}{2}}) and increasing in the interval (sqrt{frac{a}{2}}, +infty). (2) The derivative of f(x) with respect to x when b is not necessarily 0 is f'(x) = 2x - frac{a}{x} + b. Since x=2 is an extremum of f(x), it follows that f'(2) = 4 - frac{a}{2} + b = 0. Since 1 is a zero of f(x), we have f(1)=1^2 + b - aln 1 = 1 + b - 0 = 1 + b = 0. Solving the system begin{cases} 4 - frac{a}{2} + b = 0  1 + b=0  end{cases}, we get a=6 and b=-1. Therefore, a + b = 5 and the final answer is boxed{a + b = 5}. (3) Let g(b) = xb + x^2 - aln x for b in [-2, -1]. The function g(b) is linear in b and increasing. For any given b in [-2, -1], there exists x in (1, e) such that f(x) < 0 according to the problem statement. The maximum value of g(b) on x in (1, e) should be at b=-1, hence g(-1) = -x + x^2 - aln x < 0 must have solutions. Let h(x) = x^2 - x - aln x. We need to find an x_0 in (1, e) such that h(x_0) < 0 for the statement to be true. The derivative of h(x) is h'(x) = 2x - 1 - frac{a}{x}. Let varphi(x) = 2x^2 - x - a for x in (1, e). The derivative varphi'(x) = 4x - 1 > 0, so varphi(x) is increasing on (1, e). Therefore, varphi(x) > varphi(1) = 1 - a. (3-i) If 1 - a geq 0, i.e. a leq 1, then varphi(x) > 0, implying h'(x) > 0 and h(x) is increasing on (1, e), thus h(x) > h(1) = 0, which contradicts the given condition. (3-ii) If 1 - a < 0, i.e. a > 1, then varphi(1) = 1 - a < 0. For varphi(e) = 2e^2 - e - a, if a geq 2e^2 - e > 1, then varphi(e) < 0, which implies varphi(x) < 0 holds for all x in (1, e). Therefore, h'(x) < 0 is always true, and h(x) is decreasing on (1, e), guaranteeing that there exists an x_0 in (1, e) such that h(x_0) < h(1) = 0. This satisfies the condition of the problem. If 2e^2 - e > a > 1, then varphi(e) > 0. Therefore, there exists a real number m in (1, e) such that varphi(m) = 0. Consequently, varphi(x) < 0 holds for all x in (1, m), which implies h'(x) < 0, and h(x) is decreasing on (1, e). Thus, there exists an x_0 in (1, e) such that h(x_0) < h(1) = 0, satisfying the problem's statement. In summary, when a > 1, for any b in [-2, -1], there exists x in (1, e) such that f(x) < 0 holds true.

Consider the longest diagonal d of polygon mathbf{P} with endpoints A and B. Draw perpendiculars t_1 and t_2 to d passing through A and B, respectively. These perpendiculars form a strip of width d, as there cannot be points of mathbf{P} outside of this strip. If there were a point C outside this strip on the other side of t_2 from t_1, then the diagonal AC would be longer than AB, contradicting the fact that d is the longest diagonal. 2. Now, consider the support lines t_3 and t_4 of mathbf{P} that are perpendicular to t_1. Since mathbf{P} can be tiled with squares, any supporting rectangle formed by these lines is actually a square. Therefore, the distance between t_3 and t_4 is also d. 3. There must be a point of mathbf{P} on t_3; let one such point be D. Let E be the perpendicular projection of D onto t_4. We claim that E is a vertex of mathbf{P}, thereby making DE a diagonal of mathbf{P} equal in length to d and perpendicular to AB. 4. Since t_4 is a supporting line of mathbf{P}, there must be a point of mathbf{P} on t_4; denote this point by F. Point F must be a boundary point of mathbf{P} because a supporting line cannot have an interior point of the shape.  5. If F is an interior point of a side GH of mathbf{P}, then both G and H must lie on t_4. Consequently, one of the diagonals DG or DH would be longer than d. This contradicts the assumption that d is the longest diagonal. Therefore, F must be a vertex of mathbf{P} and must coincide with E. 6. Thus, DE is a diagonal of mathbf{P} that is perpendicular to AB and has length d.  Conclusion: The polygon mathbf{P} has another diagonal equal in length to d that is perpendicular to the longest diagonal d.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let ( X = {1, 2, cdots, n} ) be a set.

For terms not divisible by p_i, each term a^{phi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{p_i}. 5. **Sum Modulo p_i**: Thus, the sum S modulo p_i is:    [    S equiv left(n - 1 - leftlfloor frac{n}{p_i} rightrfloorright) cdot 1 + leftlfloor frac{n}{p_i} rightrfloor cdot 0 equiv n - 1 - leftlfloor frac{n}{p_i} rightrfloor pmod{p_i}    ]    Since n divides S, it follows that p_i divides n - 1 - leftlfloor frac{n}{p_i} rightrfloor. 6. **Congruence Relation**: Therefore, we have:    [    leftlfloor frac{n}{p_i} rightrfloor equiv -1 pmod{p_i}    ]    This implies that p_i^2 nmid n, meaning n cannot have any prime factor squared. 7. **Form of n**: Hence, n must be the product of distinct primes, i.e., n = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k. 8. **Summation of Reciprocals**: We need to show that:    [    frac{1}{p_1} + frac{1}{p_2} + cdots + frac{1}{p_k} + frac{1}{p_1 p_2 cdots p_k}    ]    is an integer.

The fly is moving on the surface of a right circular cone, and we are looking for the shortest path it can take between two points on this surface. The key to solving this problem is to \\"unwrap\\" the cone into a flat surface, which will be a circular sector. 1. **Find the Circumference of the Base of the Cone:**    The radius of the base of the cone is given as r = 600. The circumference C of the base is then calculated using the formula C = 2pi r = 2pi times 600 = 1200pi. 2. **Calculate the Slant Height (Sector's Radius) of the Cone:**    The slant height R of the cone, which will be the radius of the circular sector upon unwrapping the cone, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The height h of the cone is given as 200sqrt{7}, so we have:    [    R = sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = sqrt{600^2 + (200sqrt{7})^2} = sqrt{360000 + 280000} = sqrt{640000} = 800.    ] 3. **Determine the Angle of the Circular Sector:**    The relationship between the circumference of the base of the cone and the radius of the circular sector (the slant height of the cone) gives us the angle theta of the sector. We have C = theta R, which leads to:    [    800theta = 1200pi implies theta = frac{1200pi}{800} = frac{3pi}{2}.    ] 4. **Locate the Points on the Unwrapped Sector:**    When unwrapped, the cone's surface becomes a circular sector centered at the origin. The starting point A can be placed on the positive x-axis at (125, 0). The endpoint B should be located such that it is on the exact opposite side of the cone, which corresponds to an angle of frac{3pi}{4} radians (since theta = frac{3pi}{2} and we are looking for the bisector of this angle). This places B on the line y = -x in the second quadrant, at a distance of 375sqrt{2} from the origin, so B is at (-375, 375). 5. **Calculate the Shortest Distance:**    The shortest distance the fly can crawl is along the straight line segment AB in the unwrapped sector. Using the distance formula, we find:    [    text{Distance} = sqrt{(-375 - 125)^2 + (375 - 0)^2} = sqrt{500^2 + 375^2} = sqrt{250000 + 140625} = sqrt{390625} = 625.    ] Therefore, the least distance that the fly could have crawled is boxed{625}."},{"instruction":"A point in space (x,y,z) is randomly selected so that 2le x le 2, 2le y le 2, 2le z le 2.

Consider the sector AOB with angle alpha, and let OL be the bisector of angle AOB.  4. Assume x is a point which transitions to point y after one operation. We need to consider several cases for the positions of the points x and y relative to the sector AOB.  Case 1: Point x lies outside the sector AOB    - Let's consider the smallest k such that after k operations, the point x falls inside the sector AOB. Given beta < alpha, it follows that k < leftlceil frac{360^circ}{beta} rightrceil.    - After 2k operations, the point x ends up in a position symmetric to its initial position with respect to OL.    - Let l be the smallest number of operations needed for this symmetrical point to return inside the sector.

Case 2: Point x and y lie inside the sector AOB    - In this scenario, flipping the sector positions point y to point x, thus the point x returns to its initial position after 2 operations.

Since in all cases considered, the point x returns to its initial position in no more than N operations, each point in the pie will return to its initial position after at most N! operations. Thus, every point of the pie returns to its initial position after some finite number of operations.  boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given the random variables ( X = 1, 2, 3, ldots ) and ( Y = 0, 1, 2 ), with ( P(X=k) = frac{1}{2k} ), and ( Y equiv 3 pmod{X} ), find ( E(Y) ).","output":"To find the expected value E(Y) for the given problem where X takes values from the set {1, 2, 3, ldots} and Y equiv 3  (text{mod}  X), we need to compute the probabilities and then find the weighted sum of these probabilities.

Specifically, for large N, [ P(X equiv j  (text{mod}  3)) = sum_{i=0}^{infty} P(X = 3i + j). ] For j = 0: [ P(X equiv 0  (text{mod}  3)) = sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2(3i)} = sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{6i}. ] For (j = 1): [ P(X equiv 1  (text{mod}  3)) = sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{1}{2(3i+1)} = sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{3i+1}}. ] For (j = 2): [ P(X equiv 2  (text{mod}  3)) = sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{1}{2(3i+2)} = sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{3i+2}}. ] 4. **Calculate E(Y):** Summing these infinite series and substituting into the expectation formula yields: [  E(Y) = 0 cdot left( sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{6i} right) + 1 cdot left( sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{3i+1}} right) + 2 cdot left( sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{3i+2}} right). ] We know that: [ sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{3i+1}} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{8}} = frac{1/2}{7/8} = frac{4}{7}, ] and [ sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{3i+2}} = frac{1}{2^2} cdot frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{8}} = frac{1/4}{7/8} = frac{2}{7}. ] Substituting these into the expression for E(Y) gives: [  E(Y) = 1 cdot frac{4}{7} + 2 cdot frac{2}{7} = frac{4}{7} + frac{4}{7} = frac{8}{7}.  ] # Conclusion: Thus, the expected value E(Y) is: [ boxed{frac{8}{7}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the quadratic function y=2x^{2}, if the graph of this quadratic function is shifted 3 units downwards and then 1 unit to the left, the new function expression will be ______.","output":"To solve the problem, we follow the steps based on the principles of shifting graphs of functions: 1. **Shifting Downwards**: The given function is y = -2x^2. When we shift a graph downwards by k units, we subtract k from the function's output. Therefore, shifting the graph 3 units downwards, we get:    [    y = -2x^2 - 3    ] 2. **Shifting to the Left**: To shift a graph to the left by h units, we replace every instance of x in the function with (x + h). Thus, shifting the graph 1 unit to the left from the equation obtained in step 1, we replace x with (x + 1):    [    y = -2(x + 1)^2 - 3    ] Combining these steps, the new function expression after shifting the graph of the quadratic function y = -2x^2 3 units downwards and then 1 unit to the left is: [ boxed{y = -2(x + 1)^2 - 3} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the complex number z satisfies (1i)z=2i, where i is the imaginary unit, find the modulus of z.","output":"Starting with the equation (1-i)z=2i, we can isolate z: z = frac{2i}{1-i}.

Finally, we add the smaller angle of the parallelogram and the second largest angle of the quadrilateral: 48 degrees (smaller angle of parallelogram) + 84 degrees (second largest angle of quadrilateral) = 132 degrees So, the sum of the smaller angle of the parallelogram and the second largest angle of the quadrilateral is boxed{132}  degrees."},{"instruction":"The proposition: If x_0 in mathbb{R} and x_0^2 + 2x_0 + 2 leq 0, then the negation of this proposition is: A: x_0 in mathbb{R} and x_0^2 + 2x_0 + 2 geq 0 B: x in mathbb{R} and x^2 + 2x + 2 > 0 C: x in mathbb{R} and x^2 + 2x + 2 leq 0 D: If x_0^2 + 2x_0 + 2 leq 0, then x_0 notin mathbb{R}","output":"To negate a mathematical proposition, we change the inequality sign that establishes a condition to its opposite, without altering the domain (mathbb{R} in this case).

The circumradius (R) of the triangle can be found using the Law of Sines: 2R = frac{c}{sin C} = frac{2}{sin frac{pi}{3}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}. The perimeter P of the triangle can be expressed using the circumradius and the sum of sines of angles A, B, and C: P = a + b + c = 2R(sin A + sin B + sin C) = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}(sin A + sin(frac{2pi}{3} - A) + sin frac{pi}{3}).

However, the statement \\"Equal angles are not necessarily vertical angles\\" is a misunderstanding of the original statement. The original statement correctly asserts that vertical angles are equal, not that equal angles must be vertical. Therefore, the evaluation of this statement as false is incorrect. Vertical angles being equal is a true property.  **Statement B: Equal central angles correspond to equal arcs.** In the context of a circle, or congruent circles, it is true that equal central angles will subtend equal arcs. This is a fundamental property of circles. The original statement is true, but the provided solution incorrectly labels it as false by misinterpreting the statement.  **Statement C: If a < b, then ac^{2} < bc^{2}.** This statement needs a condition on c to be universally true. If c=0, then ac^{2} = 0 = bc^{2}, which contradicts the inequality if a < b. For c neq 0, and assuming c > 0, the inequality ac^{2} < bc^{2} holds. However, without specifying c > 0, the statement can be false, as shown by the counterexample with c=0.

If there exists an (a_{pi-1}) that satisfies (a_{pi-1} > 0.5), then (a_{pi-1} + a_{pi-2} >1), and elements (a_{pi-1}) and (a_{pi-2}) with any of the segments form a triangle. 5. Therefore, we must have (a_{pi-1} leq 0.5). 6. If there exists a segment (a_k) such that (a_k + a_{k+1} > a_{k+2}), then (a_k, a_{k+1},) and (a_{k+2}) can form a triangle. 7. If for all (k), (a_k + a_{k+1} leq a_{k+2}), then we must have [a_k leq frac{1}{2}a_{k+2} ] and continue similarly, [ a_{pi-1} leq frac{1}{2^1}, a_{pi-2} leq frac{1}{2^2}, ldots ] 8. If (n) is an odd number, the series sum can be shown as follows: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n leq 2 left(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + cdots + a_{pi-1}right) + a_pi < 2 left( frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{8} + cdots right) + 1 = 3 ] 9. If (n) is an even number, likewise, [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n leq 2 left(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + cdots - a_{n-1}right) + 1 < 2 left( frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{8} + cdots right) + 1 = 3 ] This both leads to a contradiction since: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n = 3 ] Hence the problem statement holds.

We are given that:    - Some students said, \\"There is exactly one liar next to me\\".    - The rest said, \\"There are exactly two liars next to me\\". 3. **Assuming Groups for Analysis**    If three truth-tellers sat in a row, the middle one would be surrounded by truth-tellers on both sides, which would contradict their statement (since they would be incorrectly stating the number of liars next to them), thereby making an invalid scenario.    Thus, for any group of three consecutive students, there must be at least one liar. This division leads us to splitting the group into smaller, non-overlapping sections and ensuring at least one liar exists in each group. 4. **Mathematical Breakdown**    Considering non-overlapping groups of three, we divide the 29 students into the following groups: (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), ..., up to (28, 29).

( B ) must be at a distance of 1 from ( A ) and ( C ) at a distance of 2.    - Arranging ( A, B, ) and ( C ) follows a sequential rule on the circle. 5. **Cycle and Modulo Argument**:    - Let's check if the whole length ( 1956 ) can be divided into segments that fit these constraints.    - The length constraint implies ( text{Circumference} = 1956 ).    - We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that all ( n ) points are evenly located with the given distances. 6. **Formulate Equation**:    - If we assume that each segment where the distance rule holds involves three points in sequence.    - Given that the distance rule cycles every three steps, we divide the circle’s total length by 3.

The problem asks us to determine the maximum number of these small cubes that can be intersected by a single straight line.     2. **Visualizing a Simple Example:**    To grasp the concept, consider a smaller version where ( n = 2 ). This will be easier to visualize. The larger cube has ( 2^3 = 8 ) small cubes. A line intersecting along the main diagonal of the larger cube will pass through 4 small cubes, the maximum for this case. 3. **General Case for Any ( n geq 2 ):**    Let's denote the number of intersected small cubes by ( k ). We can look at the three dimensions of the cube. Specifically, in terms of ( n ), the challenge is to determine how many small cubes a diagonal or carefully directed line can intersect.     4. **Counting Intersections:**    Suppose the line travels from one vertex of the cube to the opposite vertex. For a larger cube, it can be reasoned that the line will intersect each layer of small cubes. Starting from one corner and moving to the opposite corner means the line will make its way through each of the ( n ) layers along each dimension. 5. **Using Geometry:**    The greatest distance within the cube is along its space diagonal.

Thus, f(x) is decreasing on (0, frac{1}{e}) and increasing on (frac{1}{e}, m). Therefore, the monotonicity of f(x) on (0, m) is as follows: For 0 < m leq frac{1}{e}, f(x) is decreasing on (0, m).

Analyzing the Second Possible Outcome (Imbalance): 1. **First Weighing (Imbalance):**     - If the left pan outweighs the right pan, consider two subcases:         a. Either the heavier coin is on the left side, or         b. The lighter coin is on the right side.     - Denote heavier coin as (H) and lighter coin as (L), associated with their respective placements. 2. **Second Weighing (Further Split):**     - Take the lighter coins from the unaffected pan aside and compare against set-aside coin (E) to identify heavier/lighter properties solitarily.         - If (E) balances with the heavier side indicative coins, the unbalanced singular coin identifies heavier coin candidacy best amongst segregate. 3. **Third Weighing Involves Minimal Local Adjustments:**     - Verify combined set coins of lighter group exhibiting different characters distinctly till conclusive affirmation. 4. **Final Abstraction (General Case Conclusion):**     - Determine valid counterfeit coins when grouping results show definitive weights concurrently:     [     boxed{text{Both heavier and lighter counterfeit coins systematically identified within 3 steps.}}     ] This detailed approach ensures proper identification of counterfeit coins using no more than three precise balance weighings ensuring veracity affirmatively verified."},{"instruction":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, the point corresponding to the complex number z= frac {3+i}{1+i} lies in the (  )th quadrant.
